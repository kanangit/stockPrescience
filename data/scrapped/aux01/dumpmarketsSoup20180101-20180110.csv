Letter,2018-01-01,To the Editor:,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/opinion/amtrak-derailment.html,330," To the Editor: Re ""Derailed Infrastructure"" (editorial, Dec. 25): The rail tragedy near Tacoma, Wash., was preventable. Why did it happen? Congress is the primary culprit. For many decades, it has appropriated billions to develop, implement and operate our air traffic control system, and it has spent even more trying to make an inherently unsafe mode of transportation — highways — a little less unsafe. But railways are essentially told to ""fix the problem with your own dollars."" Railroads in Europe began to focus on ""crash avoidance"" back in the 1930s, and today most rail systems throughout the world manage to prevent such accidents. In Japan, the high-speed Shinkansen system has operated since 1964 without a single significant-injury accident. In the United States, we pay far too little attention to crash avoidance. Congress and the Federal Railroad Administration are responsible. And the media is guilty of failing to educate. DAN MCFARLING, ALOHA, ORE. The writer is a director of the Association of Oregon Rail and Transit Advocates, a rail passenger association. To the Editor: The recent Amtrak accident may indeed provoke renewed concerns about the state of America's infrastructure. It also underscores the deficiencies in funding, which is necessary to maintain and upgrade the country's aging transportation systems. There are a number of reasons for this deficiency. Primary among them is the nature of our market economy. It favors new products and services that make old ones obsolete and can create large investment returns in relatively short order. That is why government is so central to infrastructure investment; it can override financial market considerations. American capital markets don't like investing in old businesses (except perhaps real estate) unless there is a new twist. Automation could be such a twist. Perhaps new technologies involving driverless cars (and eventually pilotless airplanes) will find their way into mainstream rail applications and generate the investment interest necessary to support broader rail modernization.

Her warning was prescient, but not heeded. Studies show that the United States has among the highest rates of drug use in the world. But even as restricting supply has failed to curb abuse, aggressive policing has led to thousands of young drug users filling American prisons, where they learn how to become real criminals. The prohibitions on drugs have also created perverse economic incentives that make combating drug producers and distributors extremely difficult. The high black-market price for illegal drugs has generated huge profits for the groups that produce and sell them, income that is invested in buying state-of-the-art weapons, hiring gangs to defend their trade, paying off public officials and making drugs easily available to children, to get them addicted. Drug gangs, armed with money and guns from the United States, are causing bloody mayhem in Mexico, El Salvador and other Central American countries. In Mexico alone, drug-related violence has resulted in over 100,000 deaths since 2006. This violence is one of the reasons people leave these countries to come to the United States. Add it all up and one can see that focusing on supply has done little to curtail drug abuse while causing a host of terrible side effects. What, then, can we do? First the United States and Mexican governments must acknowledge the failure of this strategy. Only then can we engage in rigorous and countrywide education campaigns to persuade people not to use drugs. The current opioid crisis underlines the importance of curbing demand. This approach, with sufficient resources and the right message, could have a major impact similar to the campaign to reduce tobacco use. We should also decriminalize the small-scale possession of drugs for personal use, to end the flow of nonviolent drug addicts into the criminal justice system. Several states have taken a step in this direction by decriminalizing possession of certain amounts of marijuana. Mexico's Supreme Court has also declared that individuals should have the right to grow and distribute marijuana for their personal use. At the same time, we should continue to make it illegal to possess large quantities of drugs so that pushers can be prosecuted and some control over supply maintained. Finally, we must create well-staffed and first-class treatment centers where people are willing to go without fear of being prosecuted and with the confidence that they will receive effective care. The experience of Portugal suggests that younger people who use drugs but are not yet addicted can very often be turned around. Even though it is difficult to get older addicted people off drugs, treatment programs can still offer them helpful services. With such a complicated problem, we should be willing to experiment with solutions. Which advertising messages are most effective? How can treatment be made effective for different kinds of drugs and different degrees of addiction? We should have the patience to evaluate what works and what doesn't. But we must get started now. As these efforts progress, profits from the drug trade will diminish greatly even as the dangers of engaging in it will remain high. The result will be a gradual lessening of violence in Mexico and Central American countries. We have a crisis on our hands — and for the past half-century, we have been failing to solve it.

Both the United States and Mexico need to look beyond the idea that drug abuse is simply a law-enforcement problem, solvable through arrests, prosecution and restrictions on supply. We must together attack it with public health policies and education. We still have time to persuade our young people not to ruin their lives."

Most markets around the world will be closed on Monday, as traders get an extra day of rest. Across much of the United States, 2018 will begin with a continuation of unusually cold temperatures, according to the National Weather Service. Zach Wichter SMALL BUSINESS On Monday, recreational marijuana will become legal in California, the eighth state to legalize the drug. But because marijuana still does not have legal standing with the federal government, it can be difficult for marijuana start-ups to get funding from banks, or generally to conduct business as usual. Zach Wichter ECONOMY The Federal Reserve was full of optimism at the end of 2017. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate at its final meeting of the year and issued a revised economic forecast predicting faster growth in 2018, citing the effects of a major federal tax cut. The Fed also said it did not anticipate raising interest rates more quickly in response to faster growth. The question is why the Fed is willing to let the good times roll. The minutes of the December meeting, which the Fed is scheduled to release on Wednesday, may provide some answers. Binyamin Appelbaum  The Bureau of Labor Statistics is likely to report another month of strong job gains on Friday, when it releases December's data. It is too early to notice the effect of the new tax law, but economists expect that the unemployment rate will hold steady at 4.1 percent. Natalie Kitroeff"
News,2018-01-01,"KHORGOS, Kazakhstan — China’s largest shipping company has poured billions of dollars into buying seaports in Greece and other maritime nations around the world. But the location of its latest big foreign investment has given a curious twist to the expanding ambitions of the China Ocean Shipping Company: The nearest ocean is more than 1,600 miles away.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/world/asia/china-kazakhstan-silk-road.html,1684," KHORGOS, Kazakhstan — China's largest shipping company has poured billions of dollars into buying seaports in Greece and other maritime nations around the world. But the location of its latest big foreign investment has given a curious twist to the expanding ambitions of the China Ocean Shipping Company: The nearest ocean is more than 1,600 miles away. The state-owned Chinese shipping giant, known as COSCO, became the 49 percent owner this past summer of a patch of frost-covered asphalt bisected by railway tracks and lined with warehouses in landlocked Kazakhstan. The barren wilderness close to the border with China stands near the Eurasian Pole of Inaccessibility, meaning that nowhere on the landmass of Europe and Asia is more distant from the sea. But it is here, where huge, Chinese-made cranes load containers onto trains instead of ships, that China and Kazakhstan are embracing what they see as the new frontier of global commerce. Forbidding as it is, the place is a central link in what President Xi Jinping of China trumpets as the ""project of the century"" — a $1 trillion infrastructure program known as ""One Belt, One Road,"" which aims to revive the ancient Silk Road and build up other trading routes between Asia and Europe to pump Chinese products to foreign markets. The gamble is not only reshuffling global transport routes, but also shaking up Kazakh and global politics as China inserts itself deeper into a region that Russia considers squarely within its area of influence. Not least, it is testing the economic logic of China's ability to carry out its grandest of ambitions. Creating a transport hub — the Khorgos Gateway, a ""dry port,"" or terminal without water for handling cargo for trains rather than ships — in one of the world's most remote places has involved an expensive exercise in social engineering. A new town, called Nurkent, has been built from scratch — with apartment blocks, a school, kindergarten and shops to serve the railway workers, crane operators, customs officials and other staff needed to keep the dry port running. Free housing is provided. The town currently has only around 1,200 residents, but there are plans to expand it for more than 100,000. Zhaslan Khamzin, the chief executive of the company operating the dry port with help from DP World of Dubai, acknowledged that the place seemed inhospitable but, implausibly describing it as an ""oasis,"" insisted, ""This is the future."" The Chinese ""are not fools,"" he added. ""Businessmen count their money. If they invest money here, they know that in five or 10 years they will get their money back with a profit."" Kazakhstan's border area with China was a sealed military zone during the Cold War, when the armies of China and the Soviet Union clashed briefly in 1969 along their shared frontier just north of Khorgos. The biggest and richest country in the part of Central Asia formerly ruled from Moscow, Kazakhstan has tried since independence in 1991 to stay on good terms with Russia but has also steadily eroded Moscow's once overwhelmingly dominant position in the region by expanding ties with China. The dry port is just the latest step in deeper ties. Completion of an oil pipeline between Kazakhstan and China in 2009 broke an export pipeline monopoly previously held by Transneft, Russia's state-owned pipeline company. It was Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the country's sole ruler since it broke from the imploding Soviet Union, who first proposed reviving old Silk Road trade routes. The idea was later latched onto and expanded by China's Communist Party leader, Mr. Xi, in a 2013 speech in Astana, the Kazakh capital, and figured prominently in the Chinese leader's speech to an October party congress in Beijing that charted China's future as a ""great power."" The shift toward China has roiled domestic politics in Central Asia by playing into deep anti-Chinese sentiments left by Soviet propaganda and fears of China that date back centuries. Kazakh nationalists complain that their country, having gained independence from Moscow, now risks becoming a satellite of Beijing. ""When the Chinese come, the apocalypse follows,"" runs a Kazakh saying. When the Kazakh government announced legislation last year to let foreigners rent land for long periods, protesters took to the streets to denounce what many saw as the start of a Chinese land grab. President Nazarbayev, in a rare retreat, suspended the plan. But Chinese working here say there is little that will stall China's march. ""Whether by ship or by train, it doesn't make any difference to us so long as things keep moving,"" said Fan Guoming, the Chinese shipping company's newly appointed representative in Khorgos. Swaddled in a thick down jacket, he turned up in Khorgos in December as temperatures dropped to minus 10 degrees Celsius (about 14 degrees Fahrenheit) to check on his company's investment. It takes 45 to 50 days to send goods from Chinese factories to Europe by sea, but less than half that time by train through Central Asia. Transporting a shipping container overland costs around 10 times as much as by sea, but it is relatively speedy and still much cheaper than airfreight. That makes overland transport an attractive option for manufacturers of high-value, Chinese-made goods like computers, which need to get to market quickly. To prevent fragile electronics from being damaged by winter temperatures that can plunge to minus 40 (the same temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit), some of the containers that pass through Khorgos are heated. In summer there is refrigeration to prevent food and wine, which make up the bulk of goods transported back into China, from rotting. As with many grand projects involving Chinese state money, however, expansive long-term ambitions have tended to obscure short-term calculations of profit and loss. ""It is very hard to separate the hype from the reality,"" said Theresa Fallon, a China expert in Brussels who has studied the ""One Belt, One Road"" program. ""It doesn't make any economic sense to me,"" she added. The Chinese president has made development of trade routes like the ""new Silk Road"" the signature policy initiative of his leadership, which has often put politics rather than economics in the driving seat. Because China exports so much more than it imports, trains that pass westward through Central Asia laden with Chinese goods have often had to return to China with little on board, a mismatch that makes it difficult to justify the route's costs. To keep the trains running and encourage manufacturers to build factories in less developed areas, local governments in western China and elsewhere offer hefty subsidies that cut the cost of transporting a container by train through Central Asia by 30 to 40 percent. Jittery about Chinese ambitions but anxious about being left out, Russia has both helped and hindered the project. Russia clearly worries that China could ultimately try to cut it out of the transport business to Europe by building up a route through Kazakhstan across the Caspian Sea that bypasses it altogether. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia gave a big boost to what China calls the ""Silk Road economic belt"" by pushing to establish the Eurasian Economic Union, a Russian answer to the European Union. Starting in 2015, Mr. Putin's union has allowed cargo trains and trucks from Kazakhstan to pass into Russia without laborious customs inspections. At the same time, Russia put up a serious obstacle when, in retaliation for Western sanctions over its 2014 annexation of Crimea, Moscow banned the import to and even transit through Russia of many European goods, particularly food. Mr. Khamzin said this problem, though initially serious, was now easing as Russia lifts transit restrictions on various European products, including wine and meat. Building a business amid such shifting political and economic sands, Mr. Khamzin said, is a gamble. But, he added: ""If you don't take risks, you won't drink champagne."" Among those gambles is the creation of the town of Nurkent itself. Streets are clean and apartments comfortable, but young residents complain about the tedium of living and working alongside a small number of people in an isolated settlement surrounded by wilderness. ""We are not just colleagues but also neighbors. I see exactly the same people during and after work every day,"" said Alexandra Chesnokova, Khorgos Gateway's public relations manager, who likes her job but misses St. Petersburg, her previous home. Despite plans to expand the town, some officials say that technology and automation could eventually eliminate, or at least significantly reduce, the need for people. Zhandos Abilakimov, a young information technology expert, said he ""hopes that in future we can mostly remove the human factor."" Though monitored by sophisticated technology, the main activity carried out at Khorgos is very low-tech: laboriously moving containers that arrive on trains from China onto railway cars that run on the wider gauge tracks used by the Kazakh and Russian railway systems. The same operation happens in reverse for trains heading back the other way. In 2017, Khorgos handled the equivalent of more than 100,000 standard containers full of goods, double what it handled last year. It aims to handle 500,000 containers by 2020, but even that target is only around 1 percent of the volume of goods that travel from Asia westward by sea. So far, most of the Chinese-made products that pass through Khorgos are not destined for Europe but stay in Central Asia, moving on by train and truck to markets in Uzbekistan and nearby countries like Iran. But it is Europe's far bigger markets that, in the long run, will generate the traffic needed to make Khorgos and a second, more antiquated Kazakh railway hub near the Chinese border at Dostyk more than just regional pivots. Kazakhstan, like China, has invested huge political capital in making the new Silk Road work. For Mr. Nazarbayev, greater economic integration with China, despite being a touchy issue for many Kazakhs, offers the only viable way to balance the power of Russia. ""This place is not the end of the world,"" said Erik Aitbekov, the deputy head of operations at the dry port. ""Because of China, it is the center."""

As a result, it inspires some of the best fiction and nonfiction, so the upside of the risk of nuclear war is an excuse to dip into literature that offers glimpses of this other world — and some insights into how to deal with it. Thousands of North Koreans have fled their homeland since the famine of the late 1990s, and many are writing memoirs recounting their daily lives and extraordinary escapes. A leading example is IN ORDER TO LIVE: A North Korean Girl's Journey to Freedom (Penguin, paper, $17)  by Yeonmi Park, with Maryanne Vollers. Park is a young woman whose father was a cigarette smuggler and black market trader. As a girl, she believed in the regime (as did her mother), for life was steeped in propaganda and anti-Americanism. Even in her math class, ""a typical problem would go like this: 'If you kill one American bastard and your comrade kills two, how many dead American bastards do you have?'"" What opened Park's eyes was in part a pirated copy of the film ""Titanic."" The government tries hard to ban any foreign television, internet or even music, and North Korean radios, which don't have dials, can receive only local stations. But the black market fills the gap, with handymen who will tweak your radio to get Chinese stations, and with illegal thumb drives full of South Korean soap operas. I'm among those who argue that we in the West should do more to support this kind of smuggling, because it's a way to sow dissatisfaction. Indeed, what moved Park was the love story in ""Titanic"": ""I was amazed that Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were willing to die for love, not just for the regime, as we were. The idea that people could choose their own destinies fascinated me. This pirated Hollywood movie gave me my first small taste of freedom."" In the end, Park's father was arrested for smuggling, and the family's life collapsed. Park and her sister went hungry and had to drop out of school, and she survived eating insects and wild plants. So at age 13, Park and her mother crossed illegally into China — and immediately into the hands of human traffickers who were as scary as the North Korean secret police. They raped her mother and eventually Park as well, and both struggled in the netherworld in which North Koreans are stuck in China — because the Chinese authorities regularly detain them and send them home to face prison camp. Park and her mother were lucky, finally managing to sneak into Mongolia and then on to South Korea. Another powerful memoir is THE GIRL WITH SEVEN NAMES: A North Korean Defector's Story (William Collins, paper, $15.99) by Hyeonseo Lee, with David John. She is from Hyesan, the same town as Park. It's an area on the Chinese border where smuggling is rampant, where people know a bit about the outside world and where disaffection, consequently, is greater than average. Still, Lee's home, like every home, had portraits of the country's first two leaders, Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il, on the wall. (The grandson now in power, Kim Jong-un, hasn't yet made his portrait ubiquitous.) Lee begins her story recounting how her father dashed into the family home as it was burning to rescue not family valuables but rather the portraits of the first leaders. There's an entire genre of heroic propaganda stories in North Korea of people risking their lives to save such portraits. Like other kids, Lee grew up in an environment of formal reverence for the Kim dynasty. At supper she would say a kind of grace — to ""Respected Father Leader Kim Il-sung"" — before picking up her chopsticks. ""Everything we learned about Americans was negative,"" she writes. ""In cartoons, they were snarling jackals. In the propaganda posters they were as thin as sticks with hook noses and blond hair. We were told they smelled bad. They had turned South Korea into a 'hell on earth' and were maintaining a puppet government there. The teachers never missed an opportunity to remind us of their villainy. ""'If you meet a Yankee bastard on the street and he offers you candy, do not take it!' one teacher warned us, wagging a finger in the air. 'If you do, he'll claim North Korean children are beggars. Be on your guard if he asks you anything, even the most innocent questions.'"" Hmm. No wonder my attempts at interviewing North Korean kids have never been very fruitful. Lee escaped to China at age 17 and started a new life in Shanghai but remained in touch with her family. One day her mom called from North Korea. ""I've got a few kilos of ice,"" or crystal meth, she said, and she asked for Lee's help in selling it in China. ""In her world, the law was upside down,"" Lee says, explaining how corruption and cynicism had shredded the social fabric of North Korea. ""People had to break the law to live."" It's fair to wonder how accurate these books are, for there's some incentive when selling a memoir to embellish adventures. I don't know, and in the case of ""In Order to Live,"" skeptics have noted inconsistencies in the stories and raised legitimate questions. So how did North Korea come to be the most bizarre country in the world? For the history, one can't do better than Bradley K. Martin's magisterial UNDER THE LOVING CARE OF THE FATHERLY LEADER: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty (St. Martin's Griffin, paper, $29.99). Martin recounts how a minor anti-Japanese guerrilla leader named Kim Il-sung came to be installed by the Russians as leader of the half of the Korean peninsula they controlled after World War II. Martin discovers that Kim's father was a Christian and a church organist, and Kim himself attended church for a time. That didn't last, and Kim later banned pretty much all religion — though he became something of a god himself, quite a trick for an atheist. But do North Koreans really believe in this ""religion""? Judging from defectors I've interviewed and much of the literature on North Korea, many do — especially older people, farmers and those farther from the North Korean border. That's partly a tribute to the country's shameless propaganda, which B.R. Myers explores in his interesting book, THE CLEANEST RACE: How North Koreans See Themselves — And Why It Matters (Melville House, paper, $16). He notes that North Korea produced a poster showing a Christian missionary murdering a Korean child and calling for ""revenge against the Yankee vampires"" — at the same time that the United States was the country's single largest donor of humanitarian aid. Myers argues that North Koreans have focused on what he calls ""race-based paranoid nationalism,"" including bizarre ideas about how Koreans are ""the cleanest race"" — hence the title — bullied and persecuted by outsiders. For a more sympathetic view of North Korea's emergence, check out various books by Bruce Cumings, a University of Chicago historian, like KOREA'S PLACE IN THE SUN: A Modern History (W.W. Norton, paper, $19.95). Cumings argues that North Korea is to some degree a genuine expression of Korean nationalism. I think Cumings is nuts when he says, ""it is Americans who bear the lion's share of the responsibility"" for the division of the Korean peninsula. But his work is worth reading — unless you have high blood pressure, in which case consult a physician first. Whatever the uncertainties about the accuracy of recent North Korean memoirs, it's absolutely clear that some stories about North Korea are fabricated — because they're fiction. Today's political crisis with Pyongyang is a great excuse to read Adam Johnson's THE ORPHAN MASTER'S SON (Random House, paper, $17), which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2013. Johnson tells the story of a military man turned prisoner turned celebrity turned villain, dealing for a while with utterly confused American visitors — an account so implausible and bizarre that it's a perfect narrative for North Korea. The other fiction that I'd recommend is the Inspector O series by James Church, the pseudonym of a well-respected Western intelligence expert on North Korea. Inspector O is a North Korean police officer who investigates murders, a bank robbery and various other offenses, periodically dealing with foreigners and turning down chances to defect. Inspector O is a complex, nuanced figure who understands that the regime he serves is corrupt, brutal and mendacious, but he remains loyal. That's because he is a deeply patriotic and nationalistic Korean, and he resents the patronizing scorn of bullying Westerners. I think many North Korean officials today are an echo of the conflicted nationalist Inspector O."
News,2018-01-01,"The chief executive of the world’s biggest catering company, which is also one of Britain’s biggest businesses, died on Sunday in a plane crash near Sydney, the Australian police said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/business/sydney-compass-richard-cousins.html,544," The chief executive of the world's biggest catering company, which is also one of Britain's biggest businesses, died on Sunday in a plane crash near Sydney, the Australian police said. Richard Cousins, the chief executive of Compass Group, was among the six people killed when a seaplane went down off Jerusalem Bay, just north of Sydney, according to a statement from the New South Wales police. Police representatives confirmed that those who died were Mr. Cousins, his two sons, his fiancée, her daughter and the pilot of the plane. The cause of the crash was being investigated. Mr. Cousins, 58, led Compass for more than 11 years. The company employs more than 550,000 people worldwide, providing food for a wide range of organizations including Costco, Qualcomm, the University of Houston and the stadium that houses the Utah Jazz basketball team. ""We are deeply shocked and saddened by this terrible news,"" Paul Walsh, the company's chairman, said in a statement. ""It has been a great privilege to know Richard personally and to work with him for the last few years. Richard was known and respected for his great humanity and a no-nonsense style that transformed Compass into one of Britain's leading companies."" Police said they were working with officials from Australia's Transport Safety Bureau, which investigates transport accidents in the country. The Reuters news agency said that a preliminary report was expected within 30 days, but that it could take as long as a year to find out what had caused the crash. The flight was part of a trip conducted by Sydney Seaplanes, which has five aircraft transporting passengers on scenic trips above the Australian city, often to waterfront restaurants. The pilot, Gareth Morgan, had more than 10,000 hours of flight experience, the vast majority of which was on seaplanes, Aaron Shaw, the company's managing director, said in a statement. Sydney Seaplanes, which said it had not had any safety incidents since it started operating in 2005, suspended all its operations until further notice. Mr. Cousins had been expected to leave Compass at the end of March. His planned successor as chief executive, Dominic Blakemore, the company's chief operating officer for Europe, will take over immediately, Compass said. When Mr. Cousins took the helm of the company, it was mired in a corruption scandal, accused of bribing a United Nations official to garner contracts to supply peacekeepers. Settling lawsuits and ending investigations tied to the allegations cost the company 39 million pounds, it said in its 2007 annual report, around $53 million at current exchange rates. During his time as chief executive, Mr. Cousins increased the size of the company. Revenue more than doubled, and operating profit increased fourfold. The company's share price has increased by more than six times since he took over, to £16, or about $21.60, a share. Last year, The Harvard Business Review named him the 11th-best performing chief executive in the world. Compass had full-year revenue of £22.9 billion and profit of £1.7 billion in the most recent financial year, which ended in September. Compass says it holds 10 percent of the global food services market, operating across 50 countries. The company said in its most recent annual report that it served more than 5.5 billion meals a year."
News,2018-01-01,"LONDON — Victoria Alvarez is a ball of energy, darting around the Seven Sisters Indoor Market in north London.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/world/europe/london-tottenham-regeneration.html,1060," LONDON — Victoria Alvarez is a ball of energy, darting around the Seven Sisters Indoor Market in north London. On a recent morning, she broke away from chatting with a friend to burst into a general store in the market, asking its Iranian owner if he had some supplies she needed. She barely had time to hear his response before she was off again, standing behind the counter at her currency exchange and parcel shipping stall. In a brief quiet spell, when her husband took over, Ms. Alvarez walked across the hall to one of the market's hairdressers for a blow-dry. For Ms. Alvarez, a Colombia native who has had a stall here for 16 years and is president of a traders' association, the market is a second home. Customers can shop for groceries, get a bite to eat or a haircut, meet a real estate agent and get legal advice, all under one roof. Her daughter spent much of her youth in its hallways. ""To me, my roots are very important,"" she said. ""This is why this market is such an important part of the community."" Now, she says Seven Sisters Indoor Market — the biggest Latin American market in England, by its estimation — is under threat, caught in one of London's largest ever redevelopment programs. Traders say that they are being priced out, that local officials are riding roughshod over their complaints, and that a hub for the British capital's Spanish-speaking minority will be lost. The district surrounding the market, Tottenham, is one of London's most diverse, with more than 200 languages spoken in the area. It is centered on High Road, a three-mile stretch that is home to shops like halal butchers and Afro-Caribbean hairdressers, as well as small cafes, restaurants and markets like the one where Ms. Alvarez works. Tottenham is also one of London's most deprived districts, and the local council argues that it is in dire need of renewal. More than 10,000 people are on a waiting list for public housing. Measures of crime are higher than the London average. And proponents of the regeneration point to the 2011 London riots, which started in Tottenham, as evidence that the area's problems must be addressed. Like many poorer parts of London, the neighborhood also sits uncomfortably beside wealthy districts. People who live on the west side of Haringey, the council of which Tottenham is a part, live about nine years longer than those in the east. Students who live in the west typically perform better academically, and household incomes there are up to twice as high. The situation — with uncomfortable parallels to Grenfell Tower, the public housing block that was consumed by fire last June and that lay close to multimillion-pound homes — offers a window into the challenges facing London, a dynamic city with a strong economy, but one with a housing shortfall and which many residents can no longer afford. ""There is no place in London that is not experiencing these pressures,"" said Mark Brearley, a professor at London Metropolitan University's Cass Cities program. ""Tottenham is an illustration of a London-wide phenomenon."" If all goes to plan, though, that will soon change — and while those behind the plans hope to improve the area's prospects, many here fear being pushed out. A raft of projects are underway. The local Premier League soccer club, Tottenham Hotspur, is carrying out a 750-million pound, or $1 billion, stadium upgrade. Train and subway stations are being renovated, schools and health services upgraded, and around 10,000 new homes are being added. The Seven Sisters Indoor Market will be rebuilt. ""It is ambitious,"" said Alan Strickland, the local council member responsible for regeneration. ""The scale of the challenge is very big."" The market's traders — largely Colombian, but also from Peru, Ecuador, Brazil and parts of Africa — will be moved across the street in 2020 while the market is being upgraded. Then, a couple of years later, they will have the option to move back, according to the local council and Grainger, the company in charge of the development. Grainger acknowledges that some traders' rents will go up, but insists that they will be more affordable than those available on the open market. It has promised to hold rent increases to 2 percent for five years from 2020. Ms. Alvarez, 47, has led efforts to oppose the moves. She and her colleagues want stronger guarantees of rent control, more financial compensation and greater clarity about the plans. They have taken the fight to Britain's courts, and even got the United Nations human rights body to weigh in on their side. Many other locals also oppose the changes, which they disparagingly call gentrification. Farther along the High Road, the twin brothers who run Chick King, a fried chicken restaurant, are worried. Their small eatery has sat directly opposite the soccer stadium since they opened in 1981. But their cafe, along with a string of houses and shops, faces demolition to make way for a walkway connecting the stadium to a soon-to-be-redeveloped train station. ""The community wanted to see improvements,"" said Alex Tryfonos, one of the brothers, ""but not wholesale demolition of the area."" He agreed that Tottenham needed the new investment, and the jobs associated with it. But he and other business owners worry that the redevelopment will mean either being forcibly removed — an official report after the riots advocated having fewer, and larger, shops and restaurants — or being priced out. ""I'm not opposed to change,"" said Susan Nguyen, whose nail salon is a few doors down from Chick King, before adding: ""I would be heartbroken if I had to leave the area."" Mr. Strickland insisted that the plans would have a positive effect on Tottenham, and that there had been wide consultation with locals. And he said some of the factors at play, like London's sky-high property prices, were out of the local authority's control. Yet for Ms. Alvarez, the changes in the district are irreparably altering its distinct character and culture. Sitting down above a beauty salon to catch her breath, she said that when her fellow traders asked her what she thinks will happen, she was often at a loss for words. ""I cannot tell them that I can see the future so grim sometimes,"" she said. ""But sometimes I do. And I cry."""

Her women seek transcendence in exertion. They go for runs, scan the woods for bike trails, consult personal trainers. In her first book, a mesmerizing collection of stories titled ""I Want to Show You More"" (2013), running was so intensely evoked that Runner's World magazine dispatched a profile writer to the author's home. Exercise isn't the only thing in Quatro's work that's vivid. She writes about infidelity and Catholicism, about married women who long to transgress and often do. Her first book was hot to the touch for its divine, earthly and intellectual acuities. Reading it, you felt echoes of Flannery O'Connor and Graham Greene. You also felt: This writer, born in San Diego and now living in Georgia, is constructing a new skyscraper on the literary horizon. Quatro is here now with ""Fire Sermon,"" her second book and first novel. It's a disappointment. At best it's a holding pattern. Once again the protagonist is a married woman in a sexually dead marriage. She questions her faith; she works out; she falls into an affair with a man in another city. ""Fire Sermon"" is, in other words, one of Quatro's short stories extended to novel length. Yet somehow this saga lacks a novel's amplitude. The narrator, Maggie, is a writer. Even she seems aware that this thin if fervid book brings little that's fresh to the theme of illicit sexual desire. At one point Maggie says, ""I imagine writing all this down and giving the manuscript to my agent."" She imagines her bored agent replying, ""This has been done to death."" And: ""I won't be able to sell this."" Maggie and her lover, James, are close to insufferable. He's a formalist poet who has the words ""sight"" and ""vision"" tattooed on alternate wrists. His poems, written in ""hyper-regular iambic meter,"" investigate ""the apocalyptic suffering created by a market economy."" She's a woman who grew up lovely and happy and sheltered. As an adult this happiness is given a booster shot: She inherits a million dollars from a rich uncle. She became a writer after abandoning an academic career, including an unwritten dissertation on ""postcolonial reinterpretations of the Genesis story."" Her husband is an agnostic. She is starved for religious talk. Maggie and James are both 45; their children have all left for college. The adulterous couple share a peanut allergy and a fondness for the Christian mystics and ""Moby-Dick."" They have ecstatic, guilt-ridden sex in a far-flung hotel room. As James Dickey told us in one of his poems: ""guilt is magical."" For these lovers, foreplay includes dialogue like, ""Do you read much apophatic literature?"" Maggie conflates sexual and religious desire, sometimes to memorable effect. More often, these meditations set off the pretentiousness alarm that rests, like a smoke detector, at the top of one's mind. You may finally have to cover the thing with plastic wrap and a rubber band. During sex with James, she reports how ""at the deepest point of penetration the room fell away and the sky tore open and we were swept up into electric galaxies."" This sounds less like one of Erica Jong's zipless romps than technical plans still on Elon Musk's drafting table. ""Balanced on this precipice we could blow open eternity,"" Maggie thinks as she and James consider having sex. Their lives will ""explode outward in a single, effortless, life-changing orgasm."" Indeed there are so many sexual and pre-sexual explosions that reading this book is like learning about one of the terrible disasters that result when a blaze starts in a fireworks store. The tortured intensity of Maggie's longing does remind the reader of what's lost when sex is unhitched from religion. Young lovers now ""hook up,"" a healthy phrase, if as wan as a piece of Dover sole. How many will know the illicit black-mass pleasures suggested by a word like fornication? And what of Thomas, Maggie's husband? He's a good father, we are told, and handsome. He reminds an acquaintance of Maggie's of the actor Patrick Dempsey. But this McDreamy is in finance and, as Maggie writes to James in an email, ""I find the language of business inaccessible."" Thomas is frustrated by the couple's bed-death, but you understand why he turns Maggie off. He is terrible at taking hints. Early in the novel he hopes to rekindle passion by giving Maggie a flesh-colored vibrator that's ""realistic-looking, veined and arched, a switch at its base."" She despises it. Before long he's shyly back with a ""tiny pink pebble vibrator"" that's ""shaped like a kidney bean."" She resents this one, too. Finally, incredibly, he returns with a long sleek silver dildo in a drawstring bag. ""Tell me that isn't what I think,"" she says. Maggie can't believe it. Neither can the reader. We start to wonder if Thomas will next burst into the house on a giant inflatable penis like the one Mick Jagger rode onstage during the Rolling Stones' 1975 tour. Quatro made compression work for her in the stories collected in ""I Want to Show You More."" In her first novel, more is less. Her themes expand but don't noticeably take on grain or deepen. Maggie is among those people who carry their faith not like a shawl worn around the shoulders but like something heavy that must be carried with a piece of twine. It cuts the fingers; it must frequently be set down. There's real humanity in this novel, and there are insights about love and longing. Quatro is a gifted writer. But ""Fire Sermon"" ultimately reminds the reader of Emma Bovary's observation that there is ""in adultery all the banality of marriage."""
News,2018-01-01,"OAKLAND, Calif. — Retail cannabis shops in California opened their doors on Monday for the first time, inaugurating what proponents say will become the world’s largest market for legalized recreational marijuana.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/us/legal-pot-california.html,841," OAKLAND, Calif. — Retail cannabis shops in California opened their doors on Monday for the first time, inaugurating what proponents say will become the world's largest market for legalized recreational marijuana. A transaction that remains illegal in many parts of the country seemed almost banal on Monday for the customers at a dispensary in Oakland who picked out their marijuana, showed their driver's licenses and walked into the brisk morning air with their drugs in a paper bag. ""This is a whole new world opening up,"" said Diana Gladden, 48, who bought marijuana for herself and her aging parents. ""My mother, a very strict Southern Baptist, now thinks it's O.K. because it's legal."" One customer left with more than $1,000 worth of cannabis in a large grocery bag. Medical marijuana has been legal in California for more than two decades but the arrival of full legalization in the state is a milestone for the nation's fast-growing cannabis industry. Pot is now sold legally down the entire length of the West Coast, plus Alaska. A slow and halting rollout of California's new cannabis regulations limited the number of shops offering the drug on Monday to just a handful of cities across the state, including Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose and San Diego. But more municipalities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, are expected to issue licenses soon. Alex Traverso, a spokesman for California's Bureau of Cannabis Control, said around 100 dispensaries in the state were licensed to sell recreational cannabis on Monday. Outside the dispensary in Oakland nearly 200 people waited in line before dawn for the 6 a.m. start of sales. ""Happy New Year!"" Steve DeAngelo, the executive director of the dispensary, shouted through a bullhorn. ""We've been looking forward to this day for a long time."" But in a state where marijuana has been widely available for so long, the enthusiasm was relatively muted. Outside a dispensary in neighboring Berkeley only a handful of customers waited in line before sales began. California is the sixth state to introduce the sale of recreational marijuana, after Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Nevada. Massachusetts and potentially Maine are expected to begin sales this year. Legalization here may further raise tensions between the state and federal drug enforcement officials led by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a vocal opponent of legalization. The federal Drug Enforcement Administration considers marijuana a Schedule 1 drug, the same category as heroin. National opinion polls have shown a gradual and steady approval of legalization. Californians voted for recreational use of the drug by a 57 to 43 percent margin in a November 2016 ballot initiative. The law prohibits smoking in public, although such bans are already commonplace in California cities. Unlike the other states that have legalized, California has a vast industry producing the drug, much of which is illegally sold across state lines. By one estimate, California produces seven times more marijuana than it consumes. Legalization here will test whether that vast black market of growers, many of whom have been reluctant to join the legal market, will come out of the shadows. It is unclear how much legalization will increase consumption of the drug in California. Since 1996 marijuana has been available from medical dispensaries for adults with an easily obtainable recommendation card. And even those without medical cards have had little fear of prosecution. It has been many years since police officers in California made arrests for possession of small amounts of marijuana, according to Jennifer Tejada, the chairwoman of the law and legislative committee of the California Police Chief Association. Jonathan Duenas, a college student and one of the cannabis customers in Oakland on Monday, said he had come for the novelty but probably would not return. ""I have a friend who grows it,"" he said. ""I can get it much cheaper."" Even as more cities in California prepare to issue cannabis licenses, a number of questions remain about the effects and implementation of the new laws. The head of the Bureau of Cannabis Control has raised concerns that there may not be enough licensed cannabis distributors in the early days of retail sales. A similarly bumpy rollout took place in Nevada in July when the governor, Brian Sandoval, took emergency measures to combat a shortage of legal marijuana soon after legal sales began. Opponents of legalization warn that California could see an increase in traffic deaths, as appears to have happened in Colorado since stores in that state began selling recreational cannabis four years ago. Traffic deaths in Colorado involving drivers who tested positive for marijuana more than doubled from 2013 to 2016, according to a study published by a federal government agency in October. The report also noted a 35 percent increase in emergency room visits related to marijuana. California has not yet adopted a standard measure for marijuana impairment, an issue highlighted on Christmas Eve when a California highway patrolman was killed after a man whom the police said was driving under the influence of both alcohol and marijuana rammed into the back of the officer's vehicle."
News,2018-01-02,Whether an East Harlem ballpark will give way to what could be the tallest building between Midtown Manhattan and Boston may hinge upon the definition of a park versus a playground.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/nyregion/park-or-playground-semantics-dispute-illuminates-preservationists-fight.html,1092," Whether an East Harlem ballpark will give way to what could be the tallest building between Midtown Manhattan and Boston may hinge upon the definition of a park versus a playground. The latest battle between New York's preservationists and developers is being waged over a 1.5-acre parcel of jungle gym and soccer and baseball fields, known as the Marx Brothers Playground. Preservationists say there is no question that the space is a park. The city parks department has maintained the lot, wedged between 96th and 97th Streets on Second Avenue, since 1947. The department's leaf symbol adorns a plaque affixed to the gate. But city officials, who plan to partner with the developer AvalonBay to turn the site into a 68-story tower with school facilities, retail space and a mix of market-rate and affordable housing, insist the space is a playground. That seemingly minor quibble of semantics is crucial. Parks require the State Legislature's and the governor's approval before they can be modified. Playgrounds do not. Preservationists worry that the transformation of Marx Brothers Playground would encourage developers to target other parks, too. Both the project's proponents and its critics say the dispute illuminates not just the future of this one patch of synthetic turf, but also an existential question facing New York City as its growing population jostles for housing, schools and a place to breathe. ""It comes down to, What kind of city do we want to live in?"" Carter Strickland, the New York State director for the Trust for Public Land, a parks advocacy group, said. Mr. Strickland's organization backs a lawsuit filed by several preservation groups and neighborhood associations on Dec. 22 seeking to block the project. In a sign of how contentious the issue has become, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who must approve the repurposing of any parkland, plans to assign Rose Harvey, the commissioner of the state parks department, to investigate the site's historical records and determine its legal status. The unusual move stems from Mr. Cuomo's concern that developers could exploit the status of parkland as state rather than city property, which makes it exempt from city zoning rules, said Alphonso David, Mr. Cuomo's chief counsel. That status could be a boon to developers who want to circumvent height limitations on new construction, he said. And yet should Ms. Harvey find that the Marx Brothers Playground is indeed parkland, Mr. Cuomo has already signed a bill granting permission to repurpose it, provided no other legal challenges prevent its designation. ""Classification as a park or parkland should not provide zoning bonuses to private industry,"" Mr. Cuomo wrote in a memo for the bill. ""Confirming the status and nature of the land has significant legal implications for New York City and residents who want assurance that they will have access to outdoor recreation."" Parks advocates said the decision would send a signal about how the city values common space at a time when every inch of real estate is precious. ""Giving a private developer a public park to develop primarily market-rate housing is a terrible precedent,"" said Adrian Benepe, who served as the city's parks commissioner from 2002 to 2012. Mr. Benepe, now the director of city park development at the Trust for Public Land, said he could not remember another instance of parkland being repurposed for mostly private use. ""Parks are not development sites,"" he said. ""They're parks."" Mr. Benepe said the planned development would create a ""terrible and dangerous slippery slope,"" by which any playground and parkland could become vulnerable. Joanna Cawley, executive director of Carnegie Hill Neighbors, one of the neighborhood associations behind the suit, was explicit about where she thought that slippery slope could lead. ""This could really open the floodgates for Central Park being in shadow in 10 years,"" she said. ""Any parkland is up for grabs. It's up to the highest bidder."" City officials dismissed preservationists' arguments as alarmist. Wiley Norvell, a City Hall spokesman, called Ms. Cawley's concern about Central Park ""ridiculous hyperbole."" Melissa Mark-Viverito, who until recently was the City Council speaker and whose district included the playground, said protected parkland would remain exactly that. But the Marx Brothers Playground, she said, had never been in that category. The city plans to relocate and replace the playground, inch for inch, elsewhere on the block, she added. Ms. Mark-Viverito said the city had worked to expand park space in recent years, including in her district. On Dec. 18, Ms. Mark-Viverito and Mayor Bill de Blasio announced an $83 million investment to add seven acres to the East Harlem Greenway. The announcement came six days after the opening of a new park on Staten Island, which brought New York's parkland to a record high of more than 30,000 acres. Along with the City Council, the local community board and the Manhattan borough president signed off on the Marx Brothers project — an unusual degree of consensus for a land-use proposal, Alyssa Cobb Konon, an assistant commissioner at the city's parks department, said. ""That is not your typical set of approvals,"" Ms. Konon said. ""And I think it speaks to broader support for the project."" Of course, the newly filed lawsuit is evidence that the support is far from unanimous. Lynn Kelly, executive director of the group New Yorkers for Parks, said the promised new playground would not be an adequate replacement, even if it replicated the original exactly. The new playground would be used by three schools rather than one, she said, and would also stand in the shadow of a skyscraper. Ms. Kelly acknowledged that the need to add housing and educational infrastructure was pressing. But she called the perceived choice between those benefits and conservation a false narrative. ""To continue to minimize one over the other creates this impression to New Yorkers that parks and open space are an amenity as opposed to critical city infrastructure, just like a school and just like affordable housing,"" she said. Elizabeth Goldstein, president of the Municipal Art Society, another group behind the suit against the city, said the wrangling over terminology misses the broader point. Whether Marx Brothers is a playground or a park — in either the legal sense or a more colloquial one — has no bearing upon its value to the community, Ms. Goldstein said. ""There's a bit of disparagement going on here that's inappropriate and also attempts to disadvantage playgrounds, which are incredibly vital resources,"" she said. ""This idea that playgrounds are somehow different from other kinds of parkland — that's not the case in New York City."""

News,2018-01-02,"NAIROBI, Kenya — “This is the spot,” said Morris Njeru, gazing down at a tangled patch of farmland where he recently found the bloody corpses of David, Mukurino and Scratch — his last donkeys.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/science/donkeys-africa-china-ejiao.html,1965," NAIROBI, Kenya — ""This is the spot,"" said Morris Njeru, gazing down at a tangled patch of farmland where he recently found the bloody corpses of David, Mukurino and Scratch — his last donkeys. Mr. Njeru, 44, a market porter who depends on his animals to ferry goods around this city, had already lost five donkeys earlier in the year. In each case, the thieves slit the animals' throats and skinned them from the neck down, leaving the meat to vultures and hyenas. Four months later, all Mr. Njeru could find of the animals was a single hoof, which he pocketed as a memento. There are scant remains, too, of Mr. Njeru's once comfortable life. Without his animals, his income plummeted from nearly $30 per day to less than $5. He can no longer afford payments on a loan for a small piece of property he rented, and he fears he will have to take his child from boarding school. ""My life has completely changed,"" he said. ""I was depending on these donkeys to feed my family."" For Mr. Njeru and millions of others around the world, donkeys are the primary means to transport food, water, firewood, goods and people. In China, however, they have another purpose: the production of ejiao, a traditional medicine made from gelatin extracted from boiled donkey hides. Ejiao was once prescribed primarily to supplement lost blood and balance yin and yang, but today it is sought for a range of ills, from delaying aging and increasing libido to treating side effects of chemotherapy and preventing infertility, miscarriage and menstrual irregularity in women. While ejiao has been around for centuries, its modern popularity began to grow around 2010, when companies such as Dong-E-E-Jiao — the largest manufacturer in China — launched aggressive advertising campaigns. Fifteen years ago, ejiao sold for $9 per pound in China; now, it fetches around $400 per pound. As demand increased, China's donkey population — once the world's largest — has fallen to fewer than six million from 11 million, and by some estimates possibly to as few as three million. Attempts to replenish the herds have proved challenging: Unlike cows or pigs, donkeys do not lend themselves to intensive breeding. Females produce just one foal per year and are prone to spontaneous abortions under stressful conditions. So Chinese companies have begun buying donkey skins from developing nations. Out of a global population of 44 million, around 1.8 million donkeys are slaughtered per year to produce ejiao, according to a report published last year by the Donkey Sanctuary, a nonprofit based in the United Kingdom. ""There's a huge appetite for ejiao in China that shows no signs of diminishing,"" said Simon Pope, manager of rapid response and campaigns for the organization. ""As a result, donkeys are being Hoovered out of communities that depend on them."" In November, researchers at the Beijing Forestry University warned that China's demand for ejiao may cause donkeys ""to become the next pangolin."" ""China chooses to import donkeys from all over the world at high cost, which may lead to potential crisis of donkeys throughout the rest of the world,"" the researchers wrote in the Equine Veterinary Journal. Donkey skins find their way to China from nations as varied as Kyrgyzstan, Brazil and Mexico. But Africa is the epicenter of the trade, both in terms of the number of animals killed and the impact on the ground. ""In 2016, this business of donkeys erupted,"" said Obassy Nguvillah, a police superintendent in Tanzania's Monduli district, near the Kenyan border. ""There were increasing numbers of cases of guys passing into the Maasai area, taking people's donkeys and transporting them to the Chinese-owned processing plant."" In Esilalei — a village located on a sprawling, drought-plagued savanna under Mr. Nguvillah's watch — residents lost nearly 475 donkeys in a single year. While about 175 of the animals were recovered by tracking the thieves into the bush, police believe the remainder were sold to slaughterhouses. Unable to afford replacements, the former owners are still reeling. ""Nowadays, we are no longer happy because our vehicles, our donkeys, are no longer here,"" said Katasi Moko, who was left with just one donkey after four others were stolen. With five donkeys, Ms. Moko was able to complete two tasks each day: collecting water from distant wells, say, or gathering firewood. But with just one donkey, she has time to accomplish just one, because several back-and-forth trips are needed. ""Our workload has increased,"" she said. Fourteen African countries, along with Pakistan, have enacted various bans against the international donkey trade. Tanzania joined the list in June, citing concerns that its donkeys would soon be wiped out if the slaughter continued. Rimoinet Shamburi, chairman of Esilalei village, said that donkey thefts have decreased since the ban but have not ceased altogether. He believes the legal trade in Kenya is to blame. ""Things are still bad because there's an industry in Nairobi that's supporting the stealing of donkeys,"" he said. Unlike Tanzania, Kenya's donkey skin trade shows no signs of slowing. In 2016, prices for skins were fifty times higher than in 2014, while prices for live donkeys have nearly tripled, from about $60 to $165. The country's three abattoirs — all of which have Chinese owners or partners — reported processing just under 100,000 donkeys in two years, according to a government memo. Both skin and meat are exported to China, usually through Vietnam or Hong Kong. Seventeen skin traders have also opened shop, mostly in Nairobi, and a fourth abattoir is rumored to be on the way. The abattoir owners insist that they are bettering the country by generating jobs and paying handsome prices for unneeded donkeys. ""This business has helped so many people,"" said John Kariuki, director of Star Brilliant Donkey Export Abattoir in Naivasha. ""Instead of having to sell cows and goats, Maasai pastoralists are selling donkeys to pay their children's school fees."" Goldox Donkey Slaughterhouse in Baringo County — the largest of Kenya's abattoirs, claiming to process some 450 donkeys a day — also attempts to spread good will by providing free water to neighbors, and by paying school fees for four local children. Critics argue that benefits are exaggerated and that the trade creates a slew of problems. ""Donkeys are being stolen and either slaughtered in the bush or transported in a very bad way, without proper papers or public health standards,"" said a Kenyan veterinary officer who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals from government superiors. ""All of us — the donkey owners, the veterinary professionals — are against the trade, but the government is not taking a keen interest on this because it provides income to them."" According to the most recent census in 2009, Kenya had some 1.8 million donkeys supporting an estimated 10 million people. When the next count is published in 2019, Solomon Onyango, program development manager for veterinary science at The Donkey Sanctuary Kenya, expects that figure to have dropped significantly. ""Kenya's donkey population cannot sustain this demand,"" Dr. Onyango said. According to the organization, fierce demand is already draining neighboring countries; donkeys sometimes are brought into Kenya from Uganda, Somalia or Tanzania. Silas Chesebe, an interpreter at Goldox, confirmed that the animals purchased by the slaughterhouse sometimes cross borders. ""They come from all over, including Tanzania,"" he said. In an effort to safeguard against purchasing stolen donkeys, he added, Goldox requires its sellers to obtain two ""no objection"" documents signed by an on-site government meat inspector and a procurement officer. The procurement officer who issues the first document, however, is a company employee. Mr. Chesebe explained that the slaughterhouse also limits its purchases of dried skins to those sold by Turkana people — because, he said, ""everyone knows that only Turkana eat donkeys"" — and to fresh skins from sellers who claim their animals died on the way to the abattoir. Dr. Onyango maintained that none of these rules is sufficient to ensure that donkeys and skins are legally acquired. In a few rare cases, owners who live near the abattoirs have successfully identified and rescued their animals. Because of this, Lu Donglin, Goldox's director, announced in October that the abattoir would begin issuing checks that take three days to clear, allowing the company time to recoup payments in the event that stolen donkeys are reclaimed by villagers. Mr. Kariuki, of Star Brilliant, agreed that theft is a problem and said that he now requires sellers to obtain transport permits from Kenya's veterinary department. ""I try my best to stop the stealing, because it's very sad when a poor woman comes here crying that she has lost her donkey that she was depending on to carry water,"" he said. ""I really feel bad about that and discourage it."" Complaints about the abattoirs have extended beyond their role in fueling theft, however. Donkeys often arrive in horrific condition, some with broken legs or maggot-infested wounds, and many in states of near starvation. Cruelty complaints filed by the Kenya Society for the Protection and Care of Animals — including allegations that donkeys were kept for days in the sun and rain without sustenance — led the government to shut down Star Brilliant for a month. ""There's no incentive to provide food, water or veterinary care,"" Mr. Pope said. ""The situation is utterly horrendous from an animal welfare point of view."" Donkeys that die on the road, he added, are often skinned on the spot, their carcasses left to rot. Indeed, waste disposal has become a significant issue. Last fall, Goldox began dumping donkey remains at a parcel of land it purchased in Chemogoch village, down the road from its slaughterhouse. After residents living adjacent to the site complained, the company began burying the waste rather than leaving it in the open. But neighbors say the situation is still unacceptable, accusing the company of contaminating ground water and breeding disease. On a recent visit to the dumping site, several deep, open pits awaited donkey remains, while other areas were covered with recently turned earth. Donkey skulls, ribs, vertebrae and leg bones were scattered in the grass and dirt. A putrid smell hung in the air, and vultures circled overhead. Evans Kiprop, a farmer whose home is located a few yards away, claims that his cows have developed foot rot and eye problems as a result of the pollution, and that their milk production has fallen to two and a half gallons daily from about eight gallons. He said that feral dogs now frequently gather here, dragging donkey remains to areas where his children play and raising concerns about safety, sanitation and rabies. ""We don't want to eat or sleep here,"" added Koros Kipkoech, another neighbor. ""They're making our village their dumping place."" As frustrations grow, both donkey owners and the Kenya Veterinary Association have held protests in Nairobi and in other cities. In July, Mr. Njeru and more than 1,000 other theft victims called for the immediate closure of the donkey skin trade in a petition delivered to Kenya's Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, which regulates the industry. ""People are stealing and selling stolen donkeys, but the government is not helping,"" Mr. Njeru said. ""I reported the crime to the police, but they took no action."" Ministry officials did not respond to interview requests, but a memo issued in September gives no indication that officials will close the trade. Instead, it states that the industry offers strong employment opportunities and potential for economic development, a conclusion that Dr. Onyango and other critics dispute. ""Should we go into the cocaine business or the sale of elephant tusks just because it makes money?"" he said. ""You can't just allow trade in the name of business if it's hurting people."""

Sitting in one of 12 cubicles, in a former factory now occupied by the Allegheny County Police Department and the back offices of the department of Children, Youth and Families, the call screener, Timothy Byrne, listened as a preschool teacher described what a 3-year-old child had told him. The little girl had said that a man, a friend of her mother's, had been in her home when he ""hurt their head and was bleeding and shaking on the floor and the bathtub."" The teacher said he had seen on the news that the mother's boyfriend had overdosed and died in the home. According to the case records, Byrne searched the department's computer database for the family, finding allegations dating back to 2008: parental substance abuse, inadequate hygiene, domestic violence, inadequate provision of food and physical care, medical neglect and sexual abuse by an uncle involving one of the girl's two older siblings. But none of those allegations had been substantiated. And while the current claim, of a man dying of an overdose in the child's home, was shocking, it fell short of the minimal legal requirement for sending out a caseworker to knock on the family's door and open an investigation. Before closing the file, Byrne had to estimate the risk to the child's future well-being. Screeners like him hear far more alarming stories of children in peril nearly every day. He keyed into the computer: ""Low risk."" In the box where he had to select the likely threat to the children's immediate safety, he chose ""No safety threat."" Had the decision been left solely to Byrne — as these decisions are left to screeners and their supervisors in jurisdictions around the world — that might have been the end of it. He would have, in industry parlance, screened the call out. That's what happens to around half of the 14,000 or so allegations received each year in Allegheny County — reports that might involve charges of serious physical harm to the child, but can also include just about anything that a disgruntled landlord, noncustodial parent or nagging neighbor decides to call about. Nationally, 42 percent of the four million allegations received in 2015, involving 7.2 million children, were screened out, often based on sound legal reasoning but also because of judgment calls, opinions, biases and beliefs. And yet more United States children died in 2015 as a result of abuse and neglect — 1,670, according to the federal Administration for Children and Families; or twice that many, according to leaders in the field — than died of cancer. This time, however, the decision to screen out or in was not Byrne's alone. In August 2016, Allegheny County became the first jurisdiction in the United States, or anywhere else, to let a predictive-analytics algorithm — the same kind of sophisticated pattern analysis used in credit reports, the automated buying and selling of stocks and the hiring, firing and fielding of baseball players on World Series-winning teams — offer up a second opinion on every incoming call, in hopes of doing a better job of identifying the families most in need of intervention. And so Byrne's final step in assessing the call was to click on the icon of the Allegheny Family Screening Tool. After a few seconds, his screen displayed a vertical color bar, running from a green 1 (lowest risk) at the bottom to a red 20 (highest risk) on top. The assessment was based on a statistical analysis of four years of prior calls, using well over 100 criteria maintained in eight databases for jails, psychiatric services, public-welfare benefits, drug and alcohol treatment centers and more. For the 3-year-old's family, the score came back as 19 out of a possible 20. Over the course of an 18-month investigation, officials in the county's Office of Children, Youth and Families (C.Y.F.) offered me extraordinary access to their files and procedures, on the condition that I not identify the families involved. Exactly what in this family's background led the screening tool to score it in the top 5 percent of risk for future abuse and neglect cannot be known for certain. But a close inspection of the files revealed that the mother was attending a drug-treatment center for addiction to opiates; that she had a history of arrest and jail on drug-possession charges; that the three fathers of the little girl and her two older siblings had significant drug or criminal histories, including allegations of violence; that one of the older siblings had a lifelong physical disability; and that the two younger children had received diagnoses of developmental or mental-health issues. Finding all that information about the mother, her three children and their three fathers in the county's maze of databases would have taken Byrne hours he did not have; call screeners are expected to render a decision on whether or not to open an investigation within an hour at most, and usually in half that time. Even then, he would have had no way of knowing which factors, or combinations of factors, are most predictive of future bad outcomes. The algorithm, however, searched the files and rendered its score in seconds. And so now, despite Byrne's initial skepticism, the high score prompted him and his supervisor to screen the case in, marking it for further investigation. Within 24 hours, a C.Y.F. caseworker would have to ""put eyes on"" the children, meet the mother and see what a score of 19 looks like in flesh and blood. For decades, debates over how to protect children from abuse and neglect have centered on which remedies work best: Is it better to provide services to parents to help them cope or should the kids be whisked out of the home as soon as possible? If they are removed, should they be placed with relatives or with foster parents? Beginning in 2012, though, two pioneering social scientists working on opposite sides of the globe — Emily Putnam-Hornstein, of the University of Southern California, and Rhema Vaithianathan, now a professor at the Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand — began asking a different question: Which families are most at risk and in need of help? ""People like me are saying, 'You know what, the quality of the services you provide might be just fine — it could be that you are providing them to the wrong families,' "" Vaithianathan told me. Vaithianathan, who is in her early 50s, emigrated from Sri Lanka to New Zealand as a child; Putnam-Hornstein, a decade younger, has lived in California for years. Both share an enthusiasm for the prospect of using public databases for the public good. Three years ago, the two were asked to investigate how predictive analytics could improve Allegheny County's handling of maltreatment allegations, and they eventually found themselves focused on the call-screening process. They were brought in following a series of tragedies in which children died after their family had been screened out — the nightmare of every child-welfare agency. One of the worst failures occurred on June 30, 2011, when firefighters were called to a blaze coming from a third-floor apartment on East Pittsburgh-McKeesport Boulevard. When firefighters broke down the locked door, the body of 7-year-old KiDonn Pollard-Ford was found under a pile of clothes in his bedroom, where he had apparently sought shelter from the smoke. KiDonn's 4-year-old brother, KrisDon Williams-Pollard, was under a bed, not breathing. He was resuscitated outside, but died two days later in the hospital. The children, it turned out, had been left alone by their mother, Kiaira Pollard, 27, when she went to work that night as an exotic dancer. She was said by neighbors to be an adoring mother of her two kids; the older boy was getting good grades in school. For C.Y.F., the bitterest part of the tragedy was that the department had received numerous calls about the family but had screened them all out as unworthy of a full investigation. Incompetence on the part of the screeners? No, says Vaithianathan, who spent months with Putnam-Hornstein burrowing through the county's databases to build their algorithm, based on all 76,964 allegations of maltreatment made between April 2010 and April 2014. ""What the screeners have is a lot of data,"" she told me, ""but it's quite difficult to navigate and know which factors are most important. Within a single call to C.Y.F., you might have two children, an alleged perpetrator, you'll have Mom, you might have another adult in the household — all these people will have histories in the system that the person screening the call can go investigate. But the human brain is not that deft at harnessing and making sense of all that data."" She and Putnam-Hornstein linked many dozens of data points — just about everything known to the county about each family before an allegation arrived — to predict how the children would fare afterward. What they found was startling and disturbing: 48 percent of the lowest-risk families were being screened in, while 27 percent of the highest-risk families were being screened out. Of the 18 calls to C.Y.F. between 2010 and 2014 in which a child was later killed or gravely injured as a result of parental maltreatment, eight cases, or 44 percent, had been screened out as not worth investigation. According to Rachel Berger, a pediatrician who directs the child-abuse research center at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and who led research for the federal Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities, the problem is not one of finding a needle in a haystack but of finding the right needle in a pile of needles. ""All of these children are living in chaos,"" she told me. ""How does C.Y.F. pick out which ones are most in danger when they all have risk factors? You can't believe the amount of subjectivity that goes into child-protection decisions. That's why I love predictive analytics. It's finally bringing some objectivity and science to decisions that can be so unbelievably life-changing."" The morning after the algorithm prompted C.Y.F. to investigate the family of the 3-year-old who witnessed a fatal drug overdose, a caseworker named Emily Lankes knocked on their front door. The weathered, two-story brick building was surrounded by razed lots and boarded-up homes. No one answered, so Lankes drove to the child's preschool. The little girl seemed fine. Lankes then called the mother's cellphone. The woman asked repeatedly why she was being investigated, but agreed to a visit the next afternoon. The home, Lankes found when she returned, had little furniture and no beds, though the 20-something mother insisted that she was in the process of securing those and that the children slept at relatives' homes. All the appliances worked. There was food in the refrigerator. The mother's disposition was hyper and erratic, but she insisted that she was clean of drugs and attending a treatment center. All three children denied having any worries about how their mother cared for them. Lankes would still need to confirm the mother's story with her treatment center, but for the time being, it looked as though the algorithm had struck out. Charges of faulty forecasts have accompanied the emergence of predictive analytics into public policy. And when it comes to criminal justice, where analytics are now entrenched as a tool for judges and parole boards, even larger complaints have arisen about the secrecy surrounding the workings of the algorithms themselves — most of which are developed, marketed and closely guarded by private firms. That's a chief objection lodged against two Florida companies: Eckerd Connects, a nonprofit, and its for-profit partner, MindShare Technology. Their predictive-analytics package, called Rapid Safety Feedback, is now being used, the companies say, by child-welfare agencies in Connecticut, Louisiana, Maine, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Early last month, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services announced that it would stop using the program, for which it had already been billed $366,000 — in part because Eckerd and MindShare refused to reveal details about what goes into their formula, even after the deaths of children whose cases had not been flagged as high risk. The Allegheny Family Screening Tool developed by Vaithianathan and Putnam-Hornstein is different: It is owned by the county. Its workings are public. Its criteria are described in academic publications and picked apart by local officials. At public meetings held in downtown Pittsburgh before the system's adoption, lawyers, child advocates, parents and even former foster children asked hard questions not only of the academics but also of the county administrators who invited them. ""We're trying to do this the right way, to be transparent about it and talk to the community about these changes,"" said Erin Dalton, a deputy director of the county's department of human services and leader of its data-analysis department. She and others involved with the Allegheny program said they have grave worries about companies selling private algorithms to public agencies. ""It's concerning,"" Dalton told me, ""because public welfare leaders who are trying to preserve their jobs can easily be sold a bill of goods. They don't have a lot of sophistication to evaluate these products."" Another criticism of such algorithms takes aim at the idea of forecasting future behavior. Decisions on which families to investigate, the argument goes, should be based solely on the allegations made, not on predictions for what might happen in the future. During a 2016 White House panel on foster care, Gladys Carrión, then the commissioner of New York City's Administration for Children's Services, expressed worries about the use of predictive analytics by child-protection agencies. ""It scares the hell out of me,"" she said — especially the potential impact on people's civil liberties. ""I am concerned about widening the net under the guise that we are going to help them."" But in Pittsburgh, the advocates for parents, children and civil rights whom I spoke with all applauded how carefully C.Y.F. has implemented the program. Even the A.C.L.U. of Pennsylvania offered cautious praise. ""I think they're putting important checks on the process,"" said Sara Rose, a Pittsburgh lawyer with the organization. ""They're using it only for screeners, to decide which calls to investigate, not to remove a child. Having someone come to your home to investigate is intrusive, but it's not at a level of taking a child away or forcing a family to take services."" The third criticism of using predictive analytics in child welfare is the deepest and the most unsettling. Ostensibly, the algorithms are designed to avoid the faults of human judgment. But what if the data they work with are already fundamentally biased? There is widespread agreement that much of the underlying data reflects ingrained biases against African-Americans and others. (Just last month, the New York City Council voted to study such biases in the city's use of algorithms.) And yet, remarkably, the Allegheny experience suggests that its screening tool is less bad at weighing biases than human screeners have been, at least when it comes to predicting which children are most at risk of serious harm. ""It's a conundrum,"" Dalton says. ""All of the data on which the algorithm is based is biased. Black children are, relatively speaking, over-surveilled in our systems, and white children are under-surveilled. Who we investigate is not a function of who abuses. It's a function of who gets reported."" In 2015, black children accounted for 38 percent of all calls to Allegheny County's maltreatment hotline, double the rate that would be expected based on their population. Their rate of being placed outside their home because of maltreatment was even more disproportionate: eight out of every 1,000 black children residing in the county were placed outside their home that year, compared with just 1.7 of every 1,000 white children. Studies by Brett Drake, a professor in the Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis, have attributed the disproportionate number of black families investigated by child-welfare agencies across the United States not to bias, but to their higher rates of poverty. Similarly, a 2013 study by Putnam-Hornstein and others found that black children in California were more than twice as likely as white children there to be the subject of maltreatment allegations and placed in foster care. But after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, she showed that poor black children were actually less likely than their poor white counterparts to be the subject of an abuse allegation or to end up in foster care. Poverty, all close observers of child welfare agree, is the one nearly universal attribute of families caught up in the system. As I rode around with caseworkers on their visits and sat in on family-court hearings, I saw at least as many white parents as black — but they were all poor, living in the county's roughest neighborhoods. Poorer people are more likely not only to be involved in the criminal-justice system but also to be on public assistance and to get their mental-health or addiction treatment at publicly funded clinics — all sources of the data vacuumed up by Vaithianathan's and Putnam-Hornstein's predictive-analytics algorithm. Marc Cherna, who as director of Allegheny County's Department of Human Services has overseen C.Y.F. since 1996, longer than just about any such official in the country, concedes that bias is probably unavoidable in his work. He had an independent ethics review conducted of the predictive-analytics program before it began. It concluded not only that implementing the program was ethical, but also that not using it might be unethical. ""It is hard to conceive of an ethical argument against use of the most accurate predictive instrument,"" the report stated. By adding objective risk measures into the screening process, the screening tool is seen by many officials in Allegheny County as a way to limit the effects of bias. ""We know there are racially biased decisions made,"" says Walter Smith Jr., a deputy director of C.Y.F., who is black. ""There are all kinds of biases. If I'm a screener and I grew up in an alcoholic family, I might weigh a parent using alcohol more heavily. If I had a parent who was violent, I might care more about that. What predictive analytics provides is an opportunity to more uniformly and evenly look at all those variables."" For two months following Emily Lankes's visit to the home of the children who had witnessed an overdose death, she tried repeatedly to get back in touch with the mother to complete her investigation — calling, texting, making unannounced visits to the home. All her attempts went without success. She also called the treatment center six times in hopes of confirming the mother's sobriety, without reaching anyone. Finally, on the morning of Feb. 2, Lankes called a seventh time. The mother, she learned, had failed her three latest drug tests, with traces of both cocaine and opiates found in her urine. Lankes and her supervisor, Liz Reiter, then sat down with Reiter's boss and a team of other supervisors and caseworkers. ""It is never an easy decision to remove kids from home, even when we know it is in their best interest,"" Reiter told me. But, she said, ""When we see that someone is using multiple substances, we need to assure the children's safety. If we can't get into the home, that makes us worry that things aren't as they should be. It's a red flag."" The team decided to request an Emergency Custody Authorization from a family-court judge. By late afternoon, with authorization in hand, they headed over to the family's home, where a police officer met them. The oldest child answered their knock. The mother wasn't home, but all three children were, along with the mother's elderly grandfather. Lankes called the mother, who answered for the first time in two months and began yelling about what she considered an unwarranted intrusion into her home. But she gave Lankes the names of family members who could take the children for the time being. Clothing was gathered, bags packed and winter jackets put on. Then it was time for the children to get in the car with Lankes, a virtual stranger empowered by the government to take them from their mother's care. At a hearing the next day, the presiding official ordered the mother to get clean before she could have her children returned. The drug-treatment center she had been attending advised her to enter rehab, but she refused. ""We can't get in touch with her very often,"" Reiter recently told me. ""It's pretty clear she's not in a good place. The two youngest kids are actually with their dads now. Both of them are doing really, really well."" Their older brother, age 13, is living with his great-grandfather. In December, 16 months after the Allegheny Family Screening Tool was first used, Cherna's team shared preliminary data with me on how the predictive-analytics program was affecting screening decisions. So far, they had found that black and white families were being treated more consistently, based on their risk scores, than they were before the program's introduction. And the percentage of low-risk cases being recommended for investigation had dropped — from nearly half, in the years before the program began, to around one-third. That meant caseworkers were spending less time investigating well-functioning families, who in turn were not being hassled by an intrusive government agency. At the same time, high-risk calls were being screened in more often. Not by much — just a few percentage points. But in the world of child welfare, that represented progress. To be certain that those results would stand up to scrutiny, Cherna brought in a Stanford University health-policy researcher named Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert to independently assess the program. ""My preliminary analysis to date is showing that the tool appears to be having the effects it's intended to have,"" Goldhaber-Fiebert says. In particular, he told me, the kids who were screened in were more likely to be found in need of services, ""so they appear to be screening in the kids who are at real risk."" Having demonstrated in its first year of operation that more high-risk cases are now being flagged for investigation, Allegheny's Family Screening Tool is drawing interest from child-protection agencies around the country. Douglas County, Colo., midway between Denver and Colorado Springs, is working with Vaithianathan and Putnam-Hornstein to implement a predictive-analytics program there, while the California Department of Social Services has commissioned them to conduct a preliminary analysis for the entire state. ""Given the early results from Pittsburgh, predictive analytics looks like one of the most exciting innovations in child protection in the last 20 years,"" says Drake, the Washington University researcher. As an author of a recent study showing that one in three United States children is the subject of a child-welfare investigation by age 18, he believes agencies must do everything possible to sharpen their focus. Even in Illinois, where B.J. Walker, the director of the state's Department of Children and Family Services, is terminating its contract with the companies that developed Rapid Safety Feedback, predictive analytics is not dead. ""I still believe it's a good tool to make better informed decisions,"" Walker told me in December. Walker knows Cherna and Dalton and saw the long process they went through to develop the Family Screening Tool. ""They're doing a careful job,"" she said. ""Their transparency has been laudable. And transparency isn't often your friend, because you're going to make some mistakes, you're going to stumble, you're going to make changes."" Cherna and Dalton are already overseeing a retooling of Allegheny County's algorithm. So far, they have raised the program's accuracy at predicting bad outcomes to more than 90 percent from around 78 percent. Moreover, the call screeners and their supervisors will now be given less discretion to override the tool's recommendations — to screen in the lowest-risk cases and screen out the highest-risk cases, based on their professional judgment. ""It's hard to change the mind-set of the screeners,"" Dalton told me. ""It's a very strong, dug-in culture. They want to focus on the immediate allegation, not the child's future risk a year or two down the line. They call it clinical decision-making. I call it someone's opinion. Getting them to trust that a score on a computer screen is telling them something real is a process."""

Here's what you need to know: • South Korea has proposed high-level talks with North Korea next week, after the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, called for negotiations to ease military tensions and to discuss his country's participation in the Winter Olympics, which will be hosted by the South next month. In his New Year's Day speech, Mr. Kim said the North was capable of striking the mainland U.S. with a nuclear missile. ""I have a nuclear button on the desk in my office,"" he said. • In an analysis, our correspondents say the comments represent ""a canny new strategy to initiate direct talks with South Korea in the hope of driving a wedge into its seven-decade alliance with the United States."" • The largest demonstrations in the country since 2009 entered a sixth day today, with at least 21 killed and 450 arrested. The protesters are voicing discontent with the pace of political and economic change, even though many sanctions against Iran have been lifted. The weak economy particularly affects the young. Officially, youth unemployment is near 20 percent, but experts say it's closer to 40 percent. • Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blamed the country's ""enemies"" today for the protests, his first comments since the unrest started. • A wave of optimism in American businesses is bringing investment in new plants, equipment and factory upgrades that could create jobs — and perhaps raise wages. Initially inspired by the Trump administration's regulatory pullback, executives are also encouraged by continued economic growth. • ""The notion that deregulation unleashes growth is virtually impossible to find in the data,"" said a onetime economic adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden. ""What does matter is this idea that confidence matters. If their expectations about the future are positive, then it does make a difference."" • Millions of people in the U.S. have fallen victim to painkiller abuse, alcoholism, the rise of meth and the revival of heroin. As a result, entrepreneurs are sweeping in. Our multipart series examines the industry of addiction treatment, which is haphazardly regulated, poorly understood and expanding at a rapid clip. • In the first installment, we look at one of the biggest addiction-treatment companies in the country, and how the death of a patient nearly brought it down. • Addressing readers of The Times, A.

She was 77. Recy Taylor was abducted and raped by six white men in Alabama in 1944, a crime that became an early catalyst for the civil rights movement. The case never went to trial, but renewed attention decades later prompted an apology in 2011 to Mrs. Taylor by the Alabama Legislature. She was 97. • Quotation of the day ""If you want to catch a cat you have to stay up all night — that's just the name of the game."" — Jennifer Petruska, a resident of Santa Rosa, Calif., and a self-described insomniac, who spends her nights tracking and trapping pet cats who went into hiding during recent wildfires. We begin today on a high kick. The Rockettes closed their annual holiday season run on Monday, their 85th year at Radio City Music Hall in New York. But their famous kicklines are only a part of the storied history of one of New York's cultural cornerstones. Opened on Dec. 27, 1932, Radio City was ""the largest temple of entertainment of its kind in the world,"" The Times (somewhat breathlessly) proclaimed. It was part of John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s plan to revive New York during the Great Depression: by building a ""city within a city"" that would provide jobs for New Yorkers and convert a neighborhood known as ""the speakeasy belt"" into a commercial hub. Rockefeller teamed up with the Radio Corporation of America to develop the 6,200-seat theater, and the building's design became a beacon of the Art Deco form. The theater has hosted events like the MTV Video Music Awards and more than 700 movie premieres, including ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" starring Gregory Peck, a former Radio City usher. Mayor-elect John O'Brien declared the music hall ""the greatest achievement of the theatrical world,"" marking ""a new era in the history of New York.""

News,2018-01-02,Good Tuesday and happy new year!,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/dealbook/2018-business-trump.html,3229," Good Tuesday and happy new year! • Bitcoin's value jumped as Peter Thiel's venture firm emerged as an investor in the currency. • Regulatory concerns sink Ant Financial's purchase of MoneyGram. • The Nasdaq Composite closed above 7,000 for the first time. • Breakingviews thinks 2018 will be a frothy, frustrating year. • The analyst Gene Munster thinks Amazon should make a big leap into brick-and-mortar retail. Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. The value of the digital currency leapt about $1,000 this afternoon. Why? Turns out that the venture capitalist and his firm are believers. From Rob Copeland of the WSJ: Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm's most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $14,655. Why buy Bitcoin? Founders Fund is, after all, a venture firm rather than a hedge fund. But the firm apparently believes that start-up valuations currently are sky-high, while digital currencies will continue to climb in worth. Has Founders Fund made money? The WSJ reports, citing its unnamed sources, that the firm bought about $15 million in Bitcoin and that its stake is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. — Michael J. de la Merced So much for Jack Ma's charm offensive. United States officials have effectively killed Ant Financial's $1.2 billion bid to buy MoneyGram. Ant Financial, the electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, became the latest Chinese firm to have its acquisition of an American company fall apart because it was unable to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius. The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet. Shortly after President Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York City and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs. The attempted purchase of MoneyGram was seen as a test of the Trump administration's political and regulatory approach to China, and the deal's failure could spell trouble for other Chinese companies considering major acquisitions. The strong flow of Chinese money into the United States has prompted growing worries. Lawmakers from both parties have introduced legislation calling for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in the United States. They are pushing for a significant expansion of Cfius, a multiagency panel that reviews foreign deals for potential threats to national security. Of the deal, Richard Beales of Breakingviews writes: ""It would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People's Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam's payments infrastructure. ""For Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing's tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China's financial system. Rather than opening the door – arguably the old American way of showing how things ought to be done – CFIUS this time kept it closed. If it's a rebuke, it's one that's conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment."" MoneyGram's shares are down 6.8 percent after the close. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 percent Tuesday to close above 7,000 for the first time. The gain was driven by Netflix, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet and Apple, which jumped between 18 percent and 4.8 percent. Tuesday's rally follows a 28 percent gain for the Nasdaq last year. That beat the 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average and the 19 percent rise for the Standard & Poor's 500 index. So how stretched are valuations for the Nasdaq? As of Friday, the index was trading at 27.55 times the last 12 months of earnings, well above the S.&P. 500′s level of 18.27 times earnings, according to the WSJ's Ben Eisen. But the Nasdaq's current price-to-earnings ratio remains well below 72.2, which it hit in March 2000. Extra Credit: Yes, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.com drove the Nasdaq's run to 7,000. But Riot Blockchain saw the biggest percentage gain between the Nasdaq's first close above 6,000 in April to its close above 7,000 on Tuesday, writes the WSJ's Chelsey Dulaney. Shares of Riot ""surged more than 640 percent during that period, with the bulk of those gains coming after the company switched its focus to investing in blockchain technology October."" Shot: Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, won't run for re-election, according to the NYT. That gives Mitt Romney — former presidential candidate, former Massachusetts governor, former private equity mogul, current (and increasingly frequent) Trump critic — a chance to run for the seat. Chaser: — Michael J. de la Merced Money is cheap, the global economy is gaining momentum and markets are at records. ""Yet things look less reassuring close up,"" writes Quentin Webb of Breakingviews. ""The populist anger that enabled Trump and Brexit is still simmering, fueled by inequality, disruption, immigration and the echo chambers of social media. An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech's overweening power."" With that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews' predictions for 2018: In investing • ""For the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,"" and ""bond vigilantes will rise from the dead."" • ""Passive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive."" In tech • ""In tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life."" • Apple's position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley's power and lack of accountability. — Stephen Grocer We're just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster. From his note yesterday: Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count. It's a big, if logical, assumption given the ever-expanding empire that Amazon has been assembling — one that has put more and more industry incumbents on their back heels. Target shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon. Could Amazon afford Target? Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Yes, but it'd be pretty expensive. Target's market capitalization as of Tuesday morning was nearly $37 billion. Amazon had about $24.3 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, meaning that the company would have to borrow a hefty amount. Assuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion. Amazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn't struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn't stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals. (Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon's market cap. Obviously, I think it's a bit more complicated than that.) The big caveat (other than price) Obviously, it's antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart's 23 percent. But it's hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration's yardstick for market concentration is: • AT&T and Time Warner say that their proposed deal is a vertical deal that falls within the bounds of acceptable deals. The Justice Department has sued to block that. • Disney and Fox have announced a deal that would inevitably lead to lots of layoffs. President Trump has praised that transaction as potentially ""great for jobs."" ""As for antitrust, the Trump administration won't do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,"" Mr. Munster writes. That's a potentially big assumption. — Michael J. de la Merced Kevin McLaughlin of The Information reports that the two companies ""are actively working to replace Oracle software running on critical business systems with open-source database software alternatives, and have made significant progress toward getting off Oracle entirely,"" citing people familiar with the matter. ""A mass exodus from the Oracle database isn't likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives."" Oracle's shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report. — Stephen Grocer The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017. Does that mean investors should turn bearish on stocks this year? The answer is no if history is any indicator, LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick points out. Also, is the first day of trading predictive of the stock market's performance for the full year? — Stephen Grocer If you couldn't recall last year's highlights over the recent holidays, Andrew can remind you with his annual year-end column (the humor of which is his and his alone). A sample: The seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump's Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon's second headquarters. But it's a new year, and here are some important story lines we'll be keeping our eyes on: • Now that the tax fight is over, the White House is turning to trade. Will Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin be able to tame President Trump's hard-line tendencies? • Can Congress make progress on the many, many other issues it's facing? • SoftBank did its Uber deal. Will the ride-hailing giant make further strides toward going public this year? (Maybe not.) And what will Masa Son of SoftBank and his $100 billion Vision Fund get up to? • What other industries will Amazon disrupt this year? And how much bigger can Mr. Bezos's behemoth get? • North Korea is trying to drive a wedge between South Korea and the U.S. And it seems to be working. How will Mr. Trump — and the global economy — respond? • Stevie Cohen is finding takers for his new hedge fund. But how much presence will he retain in the industry? • In the world of M. & A. fights, who will AT&T or the Justice Department prevail? Broadcom or Qualcomm? And will Disney and Fox get their deal done? And the Trump administration's deregulatory push looks to be a reason for that — even if skeptics question whether rolling back government rules stimulates corporate growth. Corporate leaders always cite ""uncertainty"" as a reason to hold back on capital expenditures or transformative acquisitions. And fewer than half of the respondents in the National Association of Manufacturers' most recent survey said they faced an ""unfavorable business climate."" Yet some see a bigger phenomenon at work. This is what Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics told the NYT: ""The fundamental backdrop here is that this is a global synchronized expansion lifting everyone's spirits, from Tokyo to New York."" The tax flyaround • Corporate America's great loophole scavenger hunt has begun. (NYT) • China has responded to the tax law by temporarily exempting foreign companies from taxes on their earnings in the country — but there's a catch. (NYT) • Democrats in high-tax states are seeking ways to blunt some of the impact of the tax overhaul. (NYT) • The gig economy could get a boost. (NYT) • Betting on the dollar continuing to strengthen in 2018, thanks to the tax law. (WSJ) The Murdoch family tensions behind the Disney deal. It may have been a brief sales negotiation with Verizon that prompted Rupert Murdoch to consider selling pieces of 21st Century Fox. But the NYT reports that friction between the media mogul and his son James helped push the family toward the Disney transaction. From the article by Brooks Barnes and Sydney Ember: • James Murdoch has privately grumbled about the control that his father still exerted at Fox and has chafed at some of the elements of Fox News's coverage. • Rupert Murdoch was wary of how Hollywood was being reshaped by digital giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon, and unsure his empire could compete. • Lachlan Murdoch, who is more conservative than his brother, has become the heir apparent at what would remain of Fox, but was initially uneasy about a sell-off. What they gain: Beyond easing family tensions among the trio, the deal could make the Murdochs some of Disney's biggest shareholders. Yes, Ron Baron has lowered fees on some of his smaller funds. But he's unapologetic about charging roughly 54 percent more than the industry average. Here's what he told Landon Thomas Jr. of the NYT: ""Since inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,"" he said in an interview. ""If you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us."" How he (and other mutual funds) do it: Chalk it up to a combination of looser oversight, the $10 trillion of investor money still dedicated to actively managed funds and a lack of investor awareness that high fees don't necessarily pay for performance. Can this go on?  One fund investor's take in the NYT: ""I won't say performance warrants the fees they charge,"" said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. ""But I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition."" Bruce Steinberg, an executive at the hedge fund, and his family were among the 12 killed when a single-engine plane crashed in Costa Rica on Sunday. Ray Dalio of Bridgewater posted this to Facebook yesterday: Also of note: Richard Cousins, the C.E.O. of Compass Group, the world's biggest catering company, was one of six killed in a plane crash in Sydney on Sunday. What's notable is that Time's Up — formed by more than 300 women and including a legal-defense fund — isn't focused only on the entertainment industry. It plans to offer help to janitors, nurses, hotel staff and other blue-collar workers. Here's what Shonda Rhimes, a backer of the initiative, told Cara Buckley of the NYT: ""If this group of women can't fight for a model for other women who don't have as much power and privilege, then who can?"" Who else is involved: The actresses America Ferrera, Eva Longoria and Reese Witherspoon; Donna Langley, the chairwoman of Universal Pictures; and roughly 295 other women in Hollywood. What's different: The Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, which is backed by $13 million in donations and is overseen by Tina Tchen, a former chief of staff to Michelle Obama. It will help provide less-privileged women with lawyers to bring misconduct cases to court and protect them from blowback.

briefing,2018-01-02,Good morning.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/us/california-today-legalization-is-here-shrug.html,901," Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here's the sign-up.) An hour and a half before the Berkeley Patients Group, a marijuana dispensary, opened for business on Monday, two men were waiting in line outside. One came to witness a little slice of history — the day that recreational marijuana went on sale. The other, Anthony Moraga, was a sales representative and driver for a marijuana company. ""I'm so excited,"" Mr. Moraga said. But he also wondered why more people had not turned out. ""People lined up 24 hours for 'Star Wars,'"" he said. For those who have fought for decades for the legalization of marijuana, Monday was a big deal. There were wet eyes at Harborside, a dispensary in Oakland, when Steve DeAngelo, the executive director, made reference to veterans of the legalization movement who did not live long enough to witness the big day. But for many other fans of cannabis in California the first day of legalization was something else — a holiday gift that they already had. It's been two decades since California introduced medical marijuana, and about as long since police officers stopped arresting people for possession of small personal stashes. Over the next few weeks, as Los Angeles and San Francisco begin issuing licenses and more dispensaries open, there is likely to be a novelty effect. Many in the marijuana industry are predicting brisk sales. On Monday, one dispensary in San Diego reported a 40-minute wait for customers. And the line lengthened later in the day at the Berkeley Patients Group, perhaps once people had slept off the effects of the New Year's reveling. By day's end, it reported serving 1,500 customers.

News,2018-01-02,"When it comes to pork, most home cooks know the chop, the tenderloin, the loin roast, even the Boston butt. But because I am a sucker for the underdog and the oddball, I have a new favorite cut of pork: the country-style rib.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/dining/country-style-pork-ribs-recipes.html,843," When it comes to pork, most home cooks know the chop, the tenderloin, the loin roast, even the Boston butt. But because I am a sucker for the underdog and the oddball, I have a new favorite cut of pork: the country-style rib. Why oddball? First, it suffers from something of an identity crisis, since despite its name it's not really a rib. Second, it has an indeterminate composition, consisting of both light and dark meat. Finally, it has a tendency to slide into disreputable territory, since its name is sometimes appropriated for less desirable cuts. But like any good antihero, the country-style rib has hidden virtues. It has rich, deep pork flavor; it is generally the most inexpensive cut of pork at the meat counter; and it is ideal for those slow-cooked dishes we crave in cool weather. To understand this cut, you first need to know the blade pork chop. This chop is cut from the two ribs at the shoulder end of the pork loin. Because it comes from the intersection of the tender loin and the more fat-laden and gnarly shoulder, it has qualities of both. Butchers used to have difficulty selling this chop, because it didn't look as lean and smooth as those from the center of the loin. So it generally ended up as an ingredient in sausages or, less reputably, secreted at the bottom of a wrapped package of ""loin chops."" Then sometime back in the late 1960s or early '70s, a Chicago-area butcher, Cliff Bowes, came up with the idea of taking advantage of the popularity of ribs by fashioning these lowly chops into strips that resembled ribs. To do so, he butterflied the chops and cut through the ribs. You can recognize these traditional country-style ribs by the slender section of rib that curves prettily along the bottom. I asked butchers in New York and Boston to cut me country-style ribs, and both did it this way. In a world in which everyone used the same words to mean the same thing, that would be the end of the story. But the approach of butchers tends to be more like that of Humpty Dumpty, who said in ""Through the Looking-Glass,"" ""When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean."" So it's not surprising that three other cuts are often marketed under this name. Sometimes instead of a curving rib bone, you'll find a flat little two- or three-inch section of bone lurking along one edge of your country-style ribs. This means the chop was cut from the section of the shoulder just adjacent to the ribs; the bone is a piece of the scapula. But this is really not a big deal. Ribs fabricated in this fashion will have somewhat more fat and connective tissue and more dark meat, but are still close cousins of the more traditional cut, and cook up the same way. That's not the end of it, though. Some butchers will cut the lower part of the pork shoulder into strips and label them ""boneless country-style ribs."" They are still tasty and work well in long-cooking recipes, but you have to pay closer attention to what you're getting and avoid those with excess amounts of fat and gnarl. Then there's the higher-class impostor. Sometimes boneless rib-eye chops are fashioned into long, slender pieces and called country-style ribs. You can tell them clearly from their much lighter color and higher price — usually twice as expensive as the real thing. But since this portion of the pig is much leaner and therefore cooks differently, we'll bypass these ersatz ribs for now. Any of the other versions, though, will work just fine, particularly in stews and braises. In addition to its proportion of lean meat to fat and collagen, the country-style rib also has a shape that makes it ideal for stews. It's hard to find pre-cut pork stew meat in the supermarket, and even if you do it's not a good idea to buy it, since it usually consists of ragged little odds and ends from around the pig. So the usual drill is to buy a Boston butt and butcher it, which is a considerable amount of work. Country-style ribs, on the other hand, have considerably less fat and gnarl than the butt and come in neat pieces that are easily sliced up. In a similar way, country-style ribs brown quickly and fit neatly into a Dutch oven for long, slow braising. I don't often go for pre-salting meat, because I rarely think far enough ahead to do it. But these ribs do benefit from the process, which somehow evens out the cooking times of the darker and lighter sections, so I recommend it. If you forget it, though, forge ahead. The results will still be delicious. Recipes: Braised Country-Style Pork Ribs With Chipotle | Pork Stew With Pears and Sweet Potatoes Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

Obituary (Obit),2018-01-03,"LeRoy Jolley, a second-generation trainer under whose guidance Foolish Pleasure and Genuine Risk won the Kentucky Derby, died on Dec. 18 in Albany. He was 79.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/obituaries/leroy-jolley-dies-trained-derby-winners.html,1045," LeRoy Jolley, a second-generation trainer under whose guidance Foolish Pleasure and Genuine Risk won the Kentucky Derby, died on Dec. 18 in Albany. He was 79. His son LeRoy Jr. said the cause was lung cancer. Growing up near the Oaklawn Park racetrack in Hot Springs, Ark., Mr. Jolley never wanted to do anything but follow his father, Moody, into the business of training thoroughbreds. He was a hot walker at age 7 — walking horses after a workout to cool them off — and later an assistant trainer. By 19, he had his trainer's license, and five years later, at 24, he took Ridan, a sprinter owned by his mother, Dorothy, to the 1962 Derby, where he finished third. But it was Foolish Pleasure who brought Mr. Jolley his first measure of track immortality. ""As a kid growing up in the horse business and around the racetrack,"" he told BloodHorse magazine in 2015, ""you think that someday you'd love to have a horse good enough to run in this race or that race. And for me, Foolish Pleasure was the horse that not only ran in them but won those races."" Foolish Pleasure had won 10 of his 11 career starts when he faced 14 other horses as the favorite at the 1975 Derby. Mr. Jolley was pleased that his horse had drawn the No. 3 slot, a favorable position from the starting gate, compared with the undesirable No. 15 slot that Foolish Pleasure ran (and won) from at the Wood Memorial Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack a month earlier. ""He's had all the bad luck he needs for a while,"" Mr. Jolley said before the Derby. ""Let somebody else take the worst of it this time."" Foolish Pleasure's jockey, Jacinto Vasquez, rode the colt conservatively until he orchestrated a furious stretch run near the end that overtook Avatar and Diabolo to win by 1¾ lengths. After finishing second in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes, Foolish Pleasure faced Ruffian, an unbeaten filly, in a much-ballyhooed match race on July 6, 1975, at Belmont Park. Holding the lead after nearly half a mile, Ruffian suddenly shattered both sesamoid bones in her right foreleg and had to be euthanized. Recognizing that horse racing can be a rough, heartbreaking business, Mr. Jolley offered an unsentimental view of Ruffian's death. After the race, he said, ""This game wasn't cut out for anybody wearing short pants."" Nearly five years later, another filly, Genuine Risk, brought more glory to Mr. Jolley. But he nearly stood in her way. After her third-place finish in the 1980 Wood Memorial, he vowed that he would not send her to Churchill Downs for the Derby. ""I found out what I wanted to learn yesterday,"" he said. ""There's no sense shipping her a thousand miles to find it out again."" But after discussions with her owners, Bertram and Diana Firestone, he reversed his decision: Genuine Risk traveled to Louisville, Ky., where she became the first filly to win the Kentucky Derby since Regret in 1915. And, like Foolish Pleasure, Genuine Risk finished second at the Preakness and Belmont. ""She wanted to win, and she would run so hard after some of her races, she just practically would lay down for three or four days,"" Mr. Jolley told The Associated Press in 2008 after Genuine Risk died at age 31. Leroy Stanton Jolley was born on Jan. 14, 1938, in Hot Springs, a hotbed for horse racing known as the Saratoga of the South. He would follow his father on the racing circuit, where, in Florida, his barn was next to Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons, who trained two Triple Crown winners, Gallant Fox in 1930 and Omaha in 1935. ""I can't imagine better tutors than my father and Sunny Jim,"" he told The New York Times in 1981. Mr. Jolley left the University of Miami after one year, preferring to be schooled in barns and paddocks. He had his first winner in 1958 with Somnus, which his father bred and his mother owned. and, after taking Ridan to the Kentucky Derby and the Travers Stakes (which he lost by a nose to Jaipur), Mr. Jolley took a low-profile detour for nearly a decade, training horses in New York, Illinois and Florida to modest acclaim. He gained greater renown for Foolish Pleasure's victory at the 1975 Derby, and for his anger about track conditions at Pimlico Race Course after Honest Pleasure (who shared a sire with Foolish Pleasure) finished second at the Preakness Stakes in 1976. That year, Mr. Jolley starred in a commercial for Miller Lite beer with Foolish Pleasure and Honest Pleasure. The campaign — which used sports celebrities to market a beer that ""tastes great"" and was also ""less filling"" — put Mr. Jolley in a barn at Belmont Park with his two horses. ""I'm a man who's known for his pleasures,"" Mr. Jolley said. ""These two I train. And this one I drink. But what I love best is the way it tastes. What a pleasure.! Right, guys?"" After their whinnied assent, Mr. Jolley added, ""Am I a trainer or am I a trainer?"" In addition to his son Leroy Jr., Mr. Jolley is survived by another son, Tim; a daughter, Laura Jolley; two grandchildren; and a sister, Rosalyn McCullars. His marriage to the former Myrna Griffiths ended in divorce. He lived in Saratoga, N.Y., and Ocala, Fla. Over his career, Mr. Jolley saddled 991 winners and won purses of more than $35 million. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., where three of his horses (Genuine Risk, Foolish Pleasure and Manila) are also enshrined. He retired for a while but returned in recent years to train horses again. They were not the high-quality horses he had trained in the past. ""The people that owned them were trying to find out if they were good enough to compete in New York, and most of them weren't very good,"" LeRoy Jolley Jr. said. But it was a world that the elder Mr. Jolley missed. ""I got bored,"" he told The Paulick Report, a horse-racing news website, in 2016. ""I don't play golf anymore and I don't fish, so I went back to doing what I know."""
briefing,2018-01-03,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/briefing/iran-north-korea-donald-trump.html,1142," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: • Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blamed the country's foreign ""enemies"" for a wave of deadly protests. He did not identify those foes but said that he would address the Iranian people ""when the time is right."" The protests, increasingly aimed at the country's leaders, were set off by miscalculations in a long-simmering power struggle between hard-liners and reformers, our correspondent reports from Tehran. In a video, we look at how the current unrest differs from that in 2009. President Emmanuel Macron of France urged the Iranian government to show restraint. Meanwhile, the Trump administration expressed its support for the protesters and called for an end to restrictions on the internet. _____ • President Trump taunted Kim Jong-un over North Korea's arsenal: ""I too have a Nuclear Button,"" Mr. Trump tweeted, ""but it is a much bigger & more powerful one."" (Reactions on social media steered in a predictable direction.) He also threatened to withhold aid to Palestinians and Pakistan and  referred to his own Justice Department as ""deep state."" (Pakistan dismissed Mr. Trump's outburst as ""incomprehensible."") Separately in Washington, Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican senator and one of Mr. Trump's allies, said he would retire. The open seat creates an opportunity for Mitt Romney, a Trump critic, to run. _____ • Fake news is most likely to be read by older and more conservative Americans, according to a new study. Researchers analyzed the browsing histories of thousands of American adults during the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. The study found that even those most likely to read demonstrably false news stories online still received most of their news from the mainstream media. Facebook, by far, was the platform from which people most often navigated to a fake news site, according to researchers. _____ • The Dutch are living longer than previous generations, and often alone. New courses, which teach the elderly not only how to avoid falling but also how to fall correctly, are gaining popularity. Such classes are now common enough that the government rates them. (In one exercise, above, the students start by lowering themselves slowly onto mats. Over several weeks, they learn to fall without injuring themselves.) • Researchers in Finland have developed artificial intelligence that can generate images of celebrity look-alikes and a way to test the believability of such images. • In the European Union, a new set of rules, known as MiFID II, which extends transparency requirements beyond stocks to bonds, commodities and derivatives, takes effect today. • China is suspending the production of more than 500 car models that do not meet its fuel economy standards. • Our DealBook columnist looks at 2017's biggest deals and biggest winners. The DealBook team also took a look at key story lines for the next 12 months, including trade fights, Uber and North Korea. • Here's a snapshot of global markets. • Prosecutors in Germany are looking into complaints that two far-right lawmakers who used Twitter violated the country's newly strengthened hate speech laws. The politicians say they are being censored. [The New York Times] • The Israeli left expressed relief over the removal of wording in a bill that would have made it easier to redraw the Jerusalem map to exclude Palestinians. [The New York Times] • Bulgaria's president vetoed a bill that would establish a special antigraft unit, arguing that investigators wouldn't be sufficiently sheltered from political interference. [Reuters] • China's demand for donkey hides, to produce a gelatin used in traditional medicine, is disrupting livelihoods in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa. [The New York Times] • ""I was misguided."" A YouTube star with millions of followers apologized for posting a video that showed a dead body. [The New York Times] • Our food critic writes that revelations of sexual harassment are playing out ""excruciatingly slowly,"" if at all, in the restaurant world. [The New York Times] Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • We've long known that dietary fiber is good for us. New research explains why. • To usher in the new year, we asked creative people to share the homemade recipes they count on to detox. Here's a cleansing juice from the Missoni family. • Recipe of the day: Try pan-roasted cauliflower with garlic, parsley and rosemary. • Researchers are using treadmills to measure sea turtles' impressive stamina. • In tennis news, Andy Murray's participation in the Australian Open is in doubt because of a lingering hip problem. • Tottenham, a diverse neighborhood in London, is caught in one of the city's largest ever redevelopment programs. Some residents fear that gentrification could force them out. • Ukraine was once a vital part of the Soviet space program. The nation still holds on to its proud scientific traditions. • Finally, have a laugh at our 360-video bloopers. Here are moments that didn't make the cut. ""Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy … how can I ever forget them?"" Those were Charles M. Schulz's parting words in the final daily ""Peanuts"" comic strip, which ran 18 years ago today. They recalled a slightly less sentimental line from the strip's debut, nearly 50 years earlier, in which a carefree Charlie Brown strolls by a pair of children. ""Good ol' Charlie Brown,"" one says. ""How I hate him!"" That juxtaposition of earnestness and wry humor made ""Peanuts"" a pop-cultural mainstay for half a century, reaching 75 countries in 21 languages at its peak. Mr. Schulz, shown above in 1966, insisted on producing every aspect of the comic, making himself inseparable from his characters. ""I want it to be my words in everything I do,"" he told The Times in 1967. ""I've thought of it — hiring someone to help. Sometimes I think it would be nice. But then — what would be the point?"" When colon cancer forced Mr. Schulz to end the daily strip in 2000 at age 77, The Times invoked a dismal Charlie Brown, mourning the end of the baseball season: ""There's a dreariness in the air that depresses me."" Mr. Schulz died a month later, but all 17,897 ""Peanuts"" strips would be anthologized over the next two decades.

What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Back from a long holiday vacation, Stephen Colbert dived right back into attacking President Trump on Tuesday. He lambasted Mr. Trump for seeming to suggest in a tweet that he deserved credit for the worldwide lack of commercial jet fatalities last year. (United States-certified airlines have not had a fatal crash since 2009.) ""Trump took credit for no one dying in a plane crash this year! That explains his new campaign slogan, 'Trump 2020: You got to Tulsa, didn't ya?'"" — STEPHEN COLBERT Mr. Colbert also criticized Mr. Trump for his continuing Twitter feud with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un. ""'We will see!'? That's a little nonchalant. 'Maybe it'll lead to peace, maybe it'll lead to thermonuclear war, no way of knowing. I as the president would do something about it, but I'm too busy keeping all the planes in the sky.'"" — STEPHEN COLBERT The recreational use of marijuana became legal in California on Monday. Trevor Noah had some fun with that news, but then he pointed out that not everyone is celebrating. ""I'll tell you who I do feel bad for, though: all the O.G. black and Latino weed entrepreneurs. Think about it, they set up the weed business, they created the market, and right now they're watching all these white guys get rich while they're doing time for being ahead of their time. I say, every person who has served time for nonviolent weed offenses should automatically get a license to sell weed. That's what I believe. You don't even need to give them a certificate. You can just frame their rap sheet. It works."" — TREVOR NOAH ""These are the largest antigovernment protests in Iran since 2009, and in case you're wondering what drove these people into the streets, it wasn't that George Soros was paying them. It was that after the U.S. lifted sanctions on Iran in 2015, the Iranian government promised a big economic boom for everyone. But while the rich in Iran are getting richer, ordinary Iranians aren't noticing the benefits. And I know this third-world stuff is hard for some Americans to relate to, but just imagine if the U.S. government promised tax cuts for the middle class, but then only the rich benefited. I know, I know, that [expletive] would never happen. I know. But you know what I mean."" — TREVOR NOAH, discussing the political unrest in Iran after a segment on the recently passed Republican tax bill ""On the night of Christmas he tweeted that was fun, happy holidays, but 'back to work.' And then after tweeting, he golfed seven days in a row. It was like his version of Hanukkah: The golf was supposed to only last for a day, but instead it lasted a whole week. It was a miracle."" — JIMMY KIMMEL, on President Trump's Christmas pledge Jimmy Kimmel's cousin Sal went to Colorado, where marijuana has been legal for three years. Jordan Klepper and Tim Baltz have a pitch for the ""Make America Great Again football league.""

But first, he had something to say.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/arts/music/igor-levit-gilmore-award.html,1956," BRUSSELS — It was Nov. 9, 2016, the day after Donald J. Trump was elected president of the United States. The pianist Igor Levit strode onto the stage at the Palais des Beaux-Arts, an Art Deco gem here known as Bozar, to play Beethoven. But first, he had something to say. Declaring that ""the time of staying in my comfort zone is over,"" Mr. Levit, 30, did something that would not be in the least unusual at many kinds of concerts, but is still quite rare in classical music: He spoke directly to his audience, brought up the world outside the concert hall, and unhesitatingly took sides in a political controversy. ""Yesterday, the greatest economic power in the world has freely elected a bigot, an opportunist, an angry and dangerous man as their new president, as their commander in chief,"" Mr. Levit said, going on to denounce Brexit and the rise of the far right in France and Germany. His speech caused a commotion, as audience members called out, both attacking and defending him. ""I don't think one should use the concert stage all the time for political statements,"" he said recently. ""But this day was a very traumatic day for me, and I think for all of us: The night before, Donald Trump was elected president. I'd had a concert in London, I took a train to Brussels, I couldn't sleep all night. And I just wrote down this speech. I felt a certain urgency."" On Wednesday, Jan. 3, his potent mixture of powerful art and political candor was given a major boost: the $300,000 Gilmore Artist Award, one of the most prestigious, and unusual, prizes in classical music. Granted to a pianist every four years, it is not a competition, so contestants do not even know they are in the running. Instead, a small, anonymous jury travels incognito to concerts around the world, searching for an artist with the potential to make a mark on music. Mr. Levit has certainly, and swiftly, made a mark. It is not easy to achieve stardom as a concert pianist these days, with competitions and the recording industry fading as launchpads. Some conservatories, including the Juilliard School, have cut back on piano students, fearing that the market is saturated. Against those odds Mr. Levit has managed to break through, thanks to a combination of his playing and his daring — as in a 2015 collaboration with the artist Marina Abramovic on a stark staging of Bach's ""Goldberg"" Variations in New York. And he has stood out by emerging as the de facto pianist of the resistance, with politics that do not merely flavor his outspoken Twitter feed but inform his musical identity. On a recent Sony Classical recording, he boldly brought together three sets of variations: Bach's ""Goldbergs,"" Beethoven's ""Diabellis"" and Frederic Rzewski's on a song beloved of the Chilean left, ""The People United Will Never Be Defeated!"" At a BBC Proms concert last summer, in a London consumed by Brexit, he played an encore of Liszt's transcription of Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" — the official anthem of the European Union — and wore a small E.U. pin to drive the point home. (Breitbart took notice, in an article that described the Beethoven as a ""protest song."") Mr. Levit and one of his closest friends, Georg Diez, who writes about politics and culture for Der Spiegel, traveled together to the Idomeni refugee camp along the Greece-Macedonia border a couple of years ago to better understand the refugee crisis. ""What fascinates me about Igor is that art, life and politics are all one,"" Mr. Diez said. ""You have to understand suffering, the state of the world, in order to understand music."" Mr. Levit was born in 1987 in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia (the same city, he noted, as another, slightly younger piano star, Daniil Trifonov), where his mother was a serious pianist and his father an engineer. His family moved to Germany when he was 8 — in search, he said, of better opportunities — and settled in Hanover, where his mother still teaches at the conservatory. He wasn't shy, even as a teenage student. It was in the conservatory library that he first discovered the music of Mr. Rzewski, now 79, a passionately political American pianist and composer who is eminent in new-music circles. Mr. Levit Googled him and found his email address. ""Would you write something for me?"" Mr. Levit recalled asking. He got a response a few days later. ""So I said, 'Well, if you can find somebody to pay for it, sure, why not?'"" Mr. Rzewski recalled. ""And he did."" In 2005, Mr. Levit won the silver prize at the Arthur Rubinstein Competition in Tel Aviv, but more important, he caught the attention of the pianist Matti Raekallio, who served on the jury. Soon Mr. Levit, who had been having difficulty with one of his teachers in Hanover, was studying with him. ""I thought it a scandal that he didn't win the first prize,"" Mr. Raekallio said. ""It was so obvious that this guy could do anything."" He graduated with top marks from the conservatory in 2009, and by 2012 had signed with Sony; his first recording, of late Beethoven sonatas, won wide acclaim. The Guardian praised his poise, maturity and purity of tone in its review, proclaiming him ""the real deal, and definitely a pianist to watch."" Noting the audacity of starting a recording career with late Beethoven, usually the province of masters, Gramophone declared it ""neither reckless nor arrogant, but a debut of true significance."" Along the way he was aided by moments of serendipity: In 2014 he served as a concert stand-in for two more established pianists, Hélène Grimaud and Maurizio Pollini. Mr. Levit said that while he has always been serious about his playing, it was only in the last few years that he had found ""a certain kind of inner freedom"" as a musician. At the same time, his politics — shaped in part by the experience of being a Jewish immigrant in a Germany with a newly ascendant right flank — were beginning to evolve. The euro crisis, Occupy Wall Street and the international conflict over migration all played a role. ""The refugee crisis,"" he said, ""was a point of no return for me."" When Mr. Levit gave his North American debut recital at the Park Avenue Armory in 2014, Alex Poots, who was then its artistic director, was taken by his musicianship and thoughtfulness. He came up with the idea of pairing him with Ms. Abramovic — but first he had to get them together to see if they had chemistry. They all went out to the Chiltern Firehouse, a chic London hotel, where the deal was sealed at a noisy, crowded bar after midnight, when Ms. Abramovic turned to Mr. Levit and asked him to play something on the piano. ""I said, 'Marina, I can't play the piano here, everyone's dancing,'"" Mr. Levit recalled. But the owner silenced the D.J., and Mr. Levit played the final movement of Beethoven's ""Hammerklavier"" Sonata. Mr. Poots said that the room fell silent: ""From a noisy bar, full of party and life, you could not hear a pin drop."" The staging of the ""Goldberg"" Variations that followed involved the audience wearing noise-blocking headphones while sitting in silence for half an hour while Mr. Levit, at a grand piano, slowly moved down a long runway. When he reached the stage, the headphones came off, and Mr. Levit played. ""To focus backstage? Whatever,"" he recalled recently. ""To focus together with the audience, in the space the concert will take place? To get into the mood together? Unforgettable."" Earlier this fall Mr. Levit returned to Bozar, for more Beethoven. There were no speeches this time. But Mr. Rzewski came to hear him play, and joined him and some friends for dinner afterward, where they got into a heated discussion about why the far right was making gains in Germany. Then the lovably crusty Mr. Rzewski had a musical complaint. At a recent concert of one of his works, he said, Mr. Levit had faked a tricky passage. The fakery itself did not bother Mr. Rzewski. ""I'm the master faker,"" he said with a mischievous grin. The problem, he explained, was that Mr. Levit's solution made a hard section sound easy. ""If a composer writes a difficult piece,"" he said, ""everybody should understand it is difficult."" Mr. Levit said later that this was something he often thought about while playing, and that it had informed his take on ""The People United,"" especially on the recording. ""The only advice he gave me is that a crucial part of any piece is to hear the pianist's physical endurance,"" he said. Now, with the Gilmore Award, Mr. Levit will be given a chance to explore new horizons. The award — named for a businessman from Kalamazoo, Mich., who was devoted to the piano — is sometimes likened to the MacArthur ""genius"" grant, which also comes as a surprise to its awardees, nominated in secret. Piano competitions have of late largely failed to mint intriguing winners, but the Gilmore has favored complete artists — young but mature — like Rafal Blechacz, Kirill Gerstein, Ingrid Fliter, Piotr Anderszewski and Leif Ove Andsnes, more than flashy virtuosos. It is obvious just from looking around Mr. Levit's sparsely furnished apartment in Berlin that he is no airhead prodigy. Scores and boxed sets share space on the white shelves with books by Thomas Piketty, the economist known for his studies of income inequality; James Baldwin; and Amiri Baraka. Jascha Heifetz and David Oistrakh violin recordings are joined on his iPhone by Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar. A couple of months ago — before the Gilmore was announced, but after he learned it would be his — Mr. Levit paced nervously in the living room as his enormous Steinway grand piano went out the window. ""This is awful,"" he said, looking at the empty space where the piano, which he had nicknamed Lulu after the willful heroine of Berg's opera, had stood. Workers wrapped it in plastic; eased it onto his terrace; hoisted it by crane over neighboring trees and past a home for refugees next door; lowered it gently to the street; and loaded it onto a truck bound for Bavaria, where Mr. Levit would play it at a recording session. The piano was given to him a decade ago, at the outset of his career, by the Trustees of Independent Opera at Sadler's Wells, to help him start out. Now Mr. Levit wanted to pass it on to someone else, and choose a new instrument of his own. It was a bittersweet moment. ""I grew up with this instrument,"" he said, as it disappeared from his apartment. Last month he sent a text message from Berlin, where a new Steinway grand was making the reverse trip by crane. ""My new roommate is arriving :-),"" he wrote. (He named it Monk, after Thelonious.) Now he has a new instrument to adjust to, new concerts to plan, a new recording coming. The 250th anniversary of Beethoven's birth, in 2020, will bring plenty of work, too, for a Beethoven specialist. He said that he was still making plans for what to do with the Gilmore prize money. But Mr. Levit also fantasizes about the kind of academic fellowship that would give him time to study, reflect — and interact. (He has little in common with the stereotypical nose-to-grindstone soloist, living alone in hotel and practice rooms.) One thing that won't change is his determination not to compartmentalize his political from his artistic self. ""The idea that art is an excuse for not engaging,"" he said, ""is utterly ridiculous."""

""The effect it is to have on the city of New York is something larger than any mind can realize,"" said William Gaynor, the New York mayor who set in motion the primary phase of its construction. A public-works project of this scale had never before been undertaken in the United States, and even now, more than a century later, it is hard to fully appreciate what it did for the city and, really, the nation. Before the subway, it was by no means a foregone conclusion that New York would become the greatest city on earth. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants fleeing poverty and persecution were arriving on its doorstep every year, but most of them were effectively marooned, herded into dark, squalid tenements in disease-ridden slums. The five boroughs had recently been joined as one city, but the farms and villages of Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens might as well have been on the other side of the planet from Manhattan's teeming streets. Bound up in the fate of the city were even larger questions: Would America be able to manage the transition from the individualism and insularity that defined its 19th-century frontiers to the creative collaboration and competition of its fast-growing urban centers? Could it adapt and excel in this rapidly changing world? Were cities the past or the future of civilization? And then came the subway: hundreds of miles of track shooting out in every direction, carrying millions of immigrants out of the ghettos and into newly built homes, tying together the modern city and enabling it to become a place where anything was possible. It was the arrival of the subway that transformed a seedy neighborhood called Longacre Square into Times Square, that helped turn a single square mile surrounding the Wall Street station into the center of global finance, that made Coney Island an amusement park for the masses. It was the subway that fueled the astonishing economic growth that built the city's iconic skyscrapers. Other cities had subways, but none threaded through nearly as many neighborhoods as New York's, enabling it to move large numbers of workers between Manhattan and the middle-class boroughs — a cycle that repeated itself every day, generating ever more wealth and drawing in ever more people. As New York evolved over the decades, the subway was the one constant, the very thing that made it possible to repurpose 19th-century factories and warehouses as offices or condominiums, or to reimagine a two-mile spit of land between Manhattan and Queens that once housed a smallpox hospital as a high-tech university hub. When the city is in crisis — financial or emotional — the subway is always a crucial part of the solution. The subway led the city's recovery from the fiscal calamity of the 1970s. The subway was at the center of the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks. The subway got New York back to work after the most devastating storm in the city's history just five years ago. The questions we are facing today are not so different from the ones our predecessors faced 100 years ago. Can the gap between rich and poor be closed, or is it destined to continue to widen? Can we put the future needs of a city and a nation above the narrow, present-day interests of a few? Can we use a portion of the monumental sums of wealth that we are generating to invest in an inclusive and competitive future? The answer to all of these questions is still rumbling beneath New York City. For all the changes in transportation technology since the first tunnels were dug — the rise of the automobile, the proliferation of bike lanes and ferries, our growing addiction to ride-hailing apps and dreams of a future filled with autonomous vehicles — the subway remains the only way to move large numbers of people around the city. Today, New York's subway carries close to six million people every day, more than twice the entire population of Chicago. The subway may no longer be a technological marvel, but it continues to perform a daily magic trick: It brings people together, but it also spreads people out. It is this paradox — these constant expansions and contractions, like a beating heart — that keep the human capital flowing and the city growing. New York's subway has no zones and no hours of operation. It connects rich and poor neighborhoods alike. The subway has never been segregated. It is always open, and the fare is always the same no matter how far you need to go. In New York, movement — anywhere, anytime — is a right. Most countries treat subway systems as national assets. They understand that their cities are their great wealth creators and equality enablers and that cities don't work without subways. The public-private corporation that runs Hong Kong's subway expects 99.9 percent of its trains to run on time, and they do. (If you are traveling to the airport, you can also check your luggage at a central downtown train station and not see it again until you've landed at your destination. Imagine!) China has been feverishly building new metro systems in cities across the country, a recognition that subways are the only way to keep pace with the nation's rapid urbanization and the needs of its citizens. And it's not just new cities that are seeing major investments in their subways. Two decades ago, the decline of London's Underground became a national crisis; now it's moving toward running driverless trains. For that matter, Los Angeles — Los Angeles — recently embarked on a 40-year, $120 billion project to build out its mass-transit system. New York City's subway, meanwhile, is falling apart. If you are a regular rider, you know this firsthand. But even if you aren't, it has probably become difficult to ignore all the stories about the system's failure: the F train that was trapped between stations for close to an hour without power or air conditioning, the Q train that derailed in Brooklyn, the track fire on the A line in Harlem that sent nine passengers to the hospital. The cumulative impression of all these miserable underground experiences — and all these stories about miserable underground experiences — is that the situation is hopeless, that the subway cannot be fixed. The subway has been wrecked, and in this era of short-term thinking and government mistrust, public-works projects with benefits larger than any single mind can realize are no longer possible. But it is possible to fix the subway. And we must. Our failure to do so would be a collective and historic act of self-destruction. I. WHO WRECKED THE SUBWAY? The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the government agency that operates the subway, uses the catchall word ""incident"" to describe all the various events that impede the system's healthy functioning. Every one of these incidents triggers an investigation resulting in an incident report, a minute-by-minute account of what went wrong and the steps taken to resolve the issue. Thousands of these reports are produced every month. A random sampling of incidents from a single recent day include: ""Signal Trouble,"" ""Switch Trouble,"" ""Unruly Person(s),"" ""Track Circuit Failure,"" ""Delayed by Track/Work Gangs,"" ""Water Condition,"" ""Fire/Smoke Conditions,"" ""Debris on Roadbed,"" ""Brakes Fail to Charge"" and ""Sparks Issuing."" Among the most common were ""Excess Dwell Time"" and ""Insufficient Capacity/Crowding."" Translation: too many passengers, not enough trains. All these problems lead to one really big problem: The trains are terminally late, obstructed daily by a cascade of system failures. During the first three months of 2017, three-quarters of the subway's lines were chronically behind schedule. The worst offender, the 2 train, was late nearly 70 percent of the time. For a delayed rider wondering whom to blame, it's tempting to begin with the people you can see, the 7,000 or so men and women — track cleaners, inspectors, flaggers and other orange-vested M.T.A. employees — charged with preventing these incidents and keeping the trains moving. On a steamy morning in August, I sat among a small group of them in a dingy, defunct public elementary school in Gravesend, Brooklyn, that serves as the M.T.A.'s Transit Learning Center. Taped to the classroom wall were yellowing tabloid clips of a different kind of subway horror story — ""MAN UNDER!, RAIL HORROR: HIT THIRD TRACK AND LIVED!"" — a tableau that lent the one-day safety course, a requirement for all M.T.A. employees and contractors, some of the flavor of those grisly low-budget driver's-ed videos designed to scare teenagers straight. ""If you should do something silly today, like get hit by a train, you cannot sue New York City Transit,"" my instructor, Jim Fortin, said as he distributed release forms to the class. It's a common occurrence: A passenger is killed on the tracks pretty much every week. The course would end with a walk on a live track. If I survived the day, I would receive a laminated license qualifying me to work in the tunnels of the New York City subway system — ""in the hole,"" as it is known. Fortin walked us through the potential hazards that awaited us. He taught us the proper arm motions to use if we ever found ourselves needing to signal to an oncoming train to stop. After a short multiple-choice test and a break for lunch, we were issued orange vests, flashlights, helmets and safety goggles. Our group walked to a nearby N station, rode a few stops, transferred to the R and got off at 53rd Street, where we walked to the end of the platform and climbed down a ladder onto the tracks. Fortin soon directed us to what he called ""clear-up spots,"" small, shallow openings built into the walls of the narrow tunnels that we had been taught that morning to identify. A train was coming. I stuffed my flashlight into my back pocket and tucked myself into the tiny space, remembering Fortin's instructions: ""Get in. Get centered. Don't move."" I could hear the train approaching and see its headlight out of the corner of my eye. In about 30 seconds a string of 45-ton steel cars was thundering by, just 18 inches from my frozen body. It was terrifying, but also thrilling, like the entire industrial revolution was speeding past my face. At point-blank range, subway cars seem invincible. In fact, they can be laid low by something as insignificant as a broken bolt or a can of soda — which, when resting against the third rail, might heat up and ignite a scrap of newspaper, causing a track fire, the source of hundreds of delays every month. Every inch of the system's rails is supposed to be checked twice a week for imperfections. Much of this work happens overnight, when the frequency of trains on this 24-hour system decreases and workers are able to move more freely on the tracks. ""While the rest of the city is sleeping, there's a whole industrial ballet going on underground that most people have no idea about,"" John Samuelsen, a track inspector who now runs the Transport Workers Union of America, told me. ""It's like friggin' Brigadoon down there."" And yet a recent study found that only 3 percent of the tracks in stations meet the M.T.A.'s own standards for cleanliness. Workers face an even more insidious challenge than trash in the form of water. Many parts of the system are below the water table, and its lines course through neighborhoods that were once lush farmland. On a dry day, the M.T.A. pumps 13 million gallons of water from the system. Over time, the water corrodes the system, rusting and rotting its infrastructure — and yet sealing and grouting these leaks often requires rerouting service on lines, further frustrating riders. Next year, the L train will begin a shutdown that will last at least 15 months for repairs to its East River tunnel, which flooded during Hurricane Sandy. Some 225,000 people will have to find a new way to get in and out of Manhattan every day. No matter how diligent they may be, 7,000-odd orange-vested maintenance workers are simply not enough to keep the deteriorating system — with its 665 miles of passenger-carrying track, enough to reach all the way to Indianapolis — on schedule. All the real problems must begin elsewhere, further up the chain of command. Pretty much every decision that destroys your commute happens not below ground but above it, in an unmarked building on the West Side of Manhattan called the Rail Control Center. Here, men and women sit at computer consoles behind large wall-mounted schematic track and station displays in a high-ceilinged, windowless command space, directing the changes — moving a local train to an express track, taking a train out of service — that determine the daily transportation fate of thousands, sometimes millions, of passengers. When I visited the facility several months ago, I was greeted by the official who oversees all these disruptions, Barry Greenblatt. A tall, slender man in a gray suit with two Bic pens in his shirt pocket and a silver tie clip so tarnished that you barely make out the letters on it — ""M.T.A."" — Greenblatt is the authority's vice president and chief officer for service delivery, Department of Subways. It's his job to run the trains. Greenblatt, a 31-year veteran of the M.T.A., grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, without a car. ""I started riding trains and buses by myself pretty much from the time I was 5 years old,"" he told me after we settled into a conference room overlooking the command center. He became a bus driver when he graduated from college, fulfilling a childhood dream, and has been an employee of the M.T.A. ever since, gradually moving up the ladder to his current position. ""We operate the trains,"" he said. ""We try to run them on time — 5.66 million average daily riders, 1.7 billion annual riders. Right now, there are 585 trains out there. We will run 8,477 one-way trips over the course of a day. We hope to have 8,477 on-time trains. We're not going to do it today."" Greenblatt's morning began with a 2:30 a.m. phone call: An operator moving a train out of storage at a yard in East New York, Brooklyn, had driven through a stop signal, damaging the switch beneath him. ""The first question we would ask is whether it is going to have any impact on service,"" Greenblatt said. A few hours later, at 5:10 a.m., he received a text message about another incident: A passenger had called from the Park Place station, near City Hall, to report that there was smoke on the tracks. Seven minutes later, the New York City Police Department reported via an internal-communications line known as ""the 6 Wire"" that a transformer may have exploded in the station. Greenblatt managed the response. Service on the 2 and 3 lines was rerouted, and several teams were deployed to Park Place to figure out what was going on. They soon discovered that a chunk of metal, about 18 inches long, had fallen onto the tracks, breaking through the third-rail protection board and shorting out the power. ""If you bridge the third rail, which has 600 volts of electricity, to the signal rail, which has 12 volts of electricity,"" Greenblatt said, ""it's going to blow things."" The Rail Control Center's chief officer, Paul McPhee, showed me a picture on his phone of the charred board, which looked as though it could have been pulled from the fire pit at a campsite. It took about two and a half hours for the temporary repairs to be completed and full power to be restored. The trains could now start running again but were required to move at reduced speeds in the vicinity of the station. ""We're operating in a degraded mode right now,"" Greenblatt said. Systemwide, the biggest source of subway delays is simple overcrowding. In the 1990s, after a derailment killed five passengers and a collision killed a train operator, the M.T.A. started actively slowing down its trains. This has reduced ""throughput"" — the number of trains that move through the system at any given time — which has increased crowding. And when the subway becomes more crowded, it grows slower still, with trains stuck in stations while knots of passengers fight their way in and out of cars. As ridership grew from 2012 to 2016, the end-to-end running time during peak hours on the numbered lines increased by more than six minutes. Average train speeds are now slower than they were in 1950. The subway could be both faster and safer if all of it were controlled by a computer-based signal system, which would automatically ensure that trains are always operating at the maximum safe speed, with the narrowest possible distance between them. Instead, much of the subway uses a signal system that dates to the 1920s and '30s. What that means didn't really hit home for me until I visited the signal-repair shop at the 215th Street rail yard in Manhattan. Technicians were hunched over cast-iron gadgets — stop motors, compressors, track relays — that looked as if they belonged in the workshop of an eccentric antique collector. In the machine shop downstairs, I saw workers making mounting brackets and ball bearings; even the system's most basic parts are so obsolete that they have to be manufactured in-house. ""A lot of the equipment we really can't purchase,"" the M.T.A.'s assistant chief of signals, Salvatore Ambrosino, told me as we watched a technician assemble a tiny motor. ""Our only option is to rebuild."" What would rebuilding the subway actually look like? Replacing the signal system is just one in a long list of needs, some of which were recently compiled by the Regional Plan Association, a civic group that has been studying New York infrastructure for decades. Most of the system's 472 stations need some kind of major repair or wholesale renovation. Elevators need to be added — fewer than one in five stations are even partially accessible to people with physical disabilities. Cracked tiles and rusty columns need to be replaced. Stairwells and entryways need to be enlarged, flood-prone openings need to be waterproofed, ventilation plants need to be rebuilt. All the platforms need to be sealed off from the tracks with automatic sliding doors to prevent passengers from throwing trash on the rail bed and block them from falling, jumping or being pushed under a train. Sharp turns in tunnels throughout the system need to be reconstructed so that they are less severe, allowing for higher speeds and thus more trains. The Regional Plan Association stopped there, but you could go further. The roadbed beneath much of the track needs to be chipped out and replaced with fresh concrete and new drains. About 3,000 of the system's 6,400 cars date to the 1960s, '70s and '80s. About half of those need to be rebuilt with modern motors, wheels and brakes, as well as open gangways between the cars to increase capacity. The other half need to be replaced altogether. In the meantime, Greenblatt and his staff take it day by day, managing incidents as though they are an inevitable force of nature. When I asked him about the so-called F-train meltdown that became a media sensation in June — hundreds of passengers were stuck in a tunnel for more than 40 minutes in a 40-year-old train that lost power — he told me he was surprised the incident received so much attention. When he left work that night, it had not felt any different from any other day on the job. And in a sense, it wasn't. The F-train meltdown was just one of the 8,122 incidents reported during the month of June. ""I don't know if I like the word 'meltdown' so much,"" Greenblatt said. ""Things happen."" It is Gov. Andrew Cuomo who, by a strange quirk of New York history, is ultimately responsible for the subway. As governor, he appoints the chairman of the M.T.A. — a sprawling government bureaucracy with 70,000-plus employees overseeing nine bridges and tunnels, two commuter railroads, the New York City bus system and the subway — as well as a plurality of its directors. More to the point, he effectively controls the state budget that funds the authority. It was Cuomo who pressed the M.T.A. to complete its endlessly delayed construction on the first phase of the Second Avenue subway — three new stations; two new miles of track — before the end of 2016 and who presided over its opening in January 2017 like a proud parent. In the months that followed, though, the subway's many underlying problems burst open like a broken water main, and angry riders made a point of affixing the hashtag #CuomosMTA to their proliferating complaints on social media. After initially trying to shift the blame to the city's mayor, Bill de Blasio, Cuomo has of late been trying to recast himself as the subway's can-do savior. He convened an advisory panel, called FixNYC, to study the idea of implementing a congestion-pricing plan to help subsidize mass transit. He created an open competition called the Genius Challenge: Come up with a viable plan to fix the subway and win $1 million. And on a rainy, wind-swept night in early September, his press office invited a small group of reporters and local camera crews to assemble in a soggy, grime-caked ventilation room beneath the Union Square station to watch him roll out his latest plan. Spotlights hung from rusty columns; a dozen or so chairs were arrayed before a lectern and a video monitor. A little before midnight, Cuomo made his dramatic entrance through a large vented manhole, climbing down a metal ladder in pressed chinos, tasseled boots and a windbreaker bearing the New York State seal, and announced that he was doubling the fine for littering in the subway to $100 and buying some new jumbo-size vacuum cleaners to clean the tracks. The moves were part of Cuomo's $836 million ""NYC Subway Action Plan,"" which was unveiled last summer by the newly installed M.T.A. chairman, Joe Lhota, who had also run the authority several years earlier. The matter of who is going to cover that $836 million remains a matter of some controversy. Cuomo offered to pay for half and said the city should cover the rest. De Blasio refused, noting that the city had already given the M.T.A., which it did not control, billions of dollars in taxes. The plan remains only partially funded. This is a familiar quandary for the subway. When the M.T.A. first took control of the system in 1968, the idea was to use toll money from bridges and tunnels to subsidize the subway, but this scheme supplied only a small part of what was needed. For years, the state and federal governments picked up the shortfall, but beginning in the 1990s, Gov. George Pataki and the Republican-controlled Congress refused to cover the M.T.A.'s rising costs. It has been scrambling for new streams of income ever since. Cuomo, for all his homilies about American greatness being the product of ""what we built,"" has also rejected some efforts to add new revenue sources to the subway. In 2015, a state assemblyman from Brooklyn, Jim Brennan, wrote a bill that would have steered a small but escalating percentage of state personal-income tax to the authority. Cuomo's staff dismissed the idea. ""They said the M.T.A. wouldn't be able to spend the money, the construction industry was already at capacity,"" Brennan told me. ""Of course, when I would talk to Tom Prendergast"" — the chairman of the M.T.A. at the time — ""and his top people, they would go: 'Yes, yes, we can spend the money! Give us the money!' "" In fact, the M.T.A. has often proved all too capable of spending money, with construction costs well beyond what other cities spend on similar projects. It's fair to blame the whole New York political establishment — Cuomo, de Blasio and their counterparts stretching back decades — for presiding over the subway's decline. But the real political problem is, at root, a structural one. The subway subsists on an ad hoc patchwork of taxes implemented and overseen by a governor who represents millions of voters well beyond the greater metropolitan area. Brennan estimates that New York City is responsible for 55 percent of the state's revenues, but that doesn't change a fundamental political reality for its governors: People who don't ride the subway don't want to pay for the subway. You might say the subway is a victim of the same rural-urban divide that has come to define American politics today. A more parochial version of this divide exists in the city itself, where representatives of car-centric outer-borough neighborhoods continue to fight congestion-pricing plans that could deliver hundreds of millions of dollars every year to the M.T.A. How much money does the subway really need? The Regional Plan Association has done some preliminary estimates based on the current cost of M.T.A. projects. They calculated that renovating the 30 stations most desperately in need would run $14 billion. Dealing with those sharp turns to increase speeds and capacity would cost $5 billion. Adding 61 track miles with new stations — mainly in neighborhoods without subway access and with large and generally low-income populations that are heavily dependent on mass transit — would run another $62 billion. Replacing the signal system would cost $27 billion. The group didn't look at replacing or overhauling cars, but a recent M.T.A. contract priced them at about $2 million each, so buying all of the new cars that are needed would cost nearly $3 billion. Just this partial list — I haven't included the platform doors, for instance — brings the total to about $111 billion. It's a big number. But not when you put it in context. New York City and its environs generated $1.7 trillion in gross metropolitan product in 2016. That's roughly 9 percent of the nation's overall G.D.P. How much of that activity is dependent on the subway? About a year before Hurricane Sandy, a state-funded group of scientists and engineers produced a comprehensive (and as it happens, prescient) report on the damage that a hundred-year storm surge could cause to the system. One of the study's authors, Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist at Columbia University, told me that losing the subway for a month would cost the city about $60 billion in lost economic output. The reality of this apocalyptic scenario hasn't sunk in. Absent sufficient resources, the subway has been left with diminished ambitions and empty spectacles. Inside the ventilation room at Union Square, Cuomo delivered some remarks about the scourge of garbage in the subway and then led the group out onto the waterlogged tracks. A few industrial-strength vacuum cleaners stood waiting. The governor posed for a picture with a Starbucks cup he had picked up off the rail bed and then took a turn on the hose of the 83-horsepower Vac-Tron, sucking up watery gunk that would no doubt be back with the next heavy rain. II. WHY WE MUST SAVE THE SUBWAY The subway has been saved before, and the man who saved it was Richard Ravitch. Stocky, white-haired and gruff, Ravitch, now 84, is the type of civic macher you don't see much anymore, an urban idealist who has spent his career moving back and forth between the public and private sectors. His grandfather fled the pogroms in Russia, and — classic New York story — created a successful construction business from nothing. He lost everything in the Depression, and then his son, Ravitch's father, made his name building apartment buildings on Central Park West. Ravitch followed his father into the real estate business. In the 1960s, he served on President Lyndon Johnson's National Commission on Urban Problems, and in 1973, after 12 years of trying, he completed Waterside, a $78 million, 1,470-unit development for low-and-middle-income families on the East River, just south of the United Nations. A couple of years later, Ravitch played a critical role in rescuing New York City from its fiscal crisis, helping to persuade the teachers' union to invest $150 million of its pension fund in a new series of city bonds. And in 1979, he was named chairman of the M.T.A. Ravitch didn't need the job or even really want it. He waived his salary and took to wearing a bulletproof vest in public after someone threatening to kill him shot an M.T.A. police officer at his office. But he was a child of the New Deal and a passionate believer in the subway, which at the time was in even worse shape than it is today. During the fiscal crisis, drastic funding cuts had spun the subway into a downward spiral of deteriorating tracks, malfunctioning cars, increasing crime and falling ridership, a steep decline that tracked the city's own postindustrial collapse. To reverse the trend, Ravitch prepared a detailed breakdown of the costs of repairing and replacing all of the system's outdated equipment and proposed a sweeping plan to help fund the work. He argued at the time: ""The transit situation, though lacking the drama of imminent bankruptcy, represents an equally grave threat to our economy, the social equilibrium and the survival of the greatest city in the world."" The subway's importance to the city begins with a single, durable economic principle: Cities create density, and density creates growth. Economists call the phenomenon agglomeration. Not only does geographical proximity reduce costs, but it also facilitates the exchange of knowledge and spurs innovation. It's a principle that holds true for better and worse and regardless of the industry. The free-market economist Edward Glaeser has pointed out that the junk bonds and leveraged buyouts of '70s and '80s Wall Street were as much the product of human collaboration as they were of corporate greed. The urban-planning professor Elizabeth Currid-Halkett coined the phrase ""the Warhol economy"" to describe how this same sort of cross-fertilization and idea-sharing works in New York's art, fashion and music worlds. As industries grow, they attract and create new, connected ones: Book publishers beget book agents, tech start-ups beget venture-capital firms and so on. It all begins with the ability to pack large numbers of people into small spaces and then unpack them at the end of the day. Without the subway, this process breaks down, and the city dissipates. Ravitch took his case to editorial boards and legislative leaders. But there was a problem. No one wanted new taxes. So Ravitch cold-called David Rockefeller, the longtime head of Chase Manhattan Bank. ""I said, 'Mr. Rockefeller, this is an audacious request, but would you get up at 5 in the morning and let me show you the subway system?' "" he told me one afternoon in his office at Waterside. ""And he said yes."" Ravitch then suggested that Rockefeller bring along the chairman of MetLife and the president of AT&T. All three went and saw the dirty, graffiti-scarred system firsthand. As Ravitch tells the story, that was all it took: Rockefeller called the majority leader of the State Senate and told him to ""give Ravitch what he needs."" The tax package passed, and Ravitch ultimately raised $7.7 billion — more than $17 billion in today's dollars — much of which was spent replacing cars, refurbishing stations and increasing maintenance. The turnaround was not immediate. A year after Ravitch's tax plan was enacted, annual subway ridership dropped below one billion. But before long, as the system gradually became safer, more reliable and less unsavory, it started to trend up. By 2015, ridership had hit 1.7 billion, a level not seen since the late 1940s. The rejuvenation of the subway has been intertwined with a protracted period of staggering economic prosperity — agglomeration at work. New York rebuilt the subway, and the subway rebuilt the city. It was one of the great urban renaissance stories of our modern era. But now that the city is thriving, it faces another challenge, perhaps an even greater one: how to spread this staggering wealth more evenly. The subway might again be a central part of the solution. If the story of the subway is the story of density, it is also the story of land — and more to the point, the story of land value. Before the first tracks had even been laid, real estate speculators were gobbling up farmland and empty lots along the proposed route and then quickly flipping their parcels at huge premiums to builders. When the subway recovered from its last major crisis, it again began throwing off enormous returns for the owners of the land above it. From 1993 to 2013, the average price for a co-op or condo in TriBeCa rose from $182 per square foot to $1,569. In the process, prime real estate in Manhattan was transformed from a place where people lived and built businesses into a high-yield investment in which absentee owners parked their money and watched it grow. As Manhattan's business-district centers became denser and its scarce real estate more expensive, the growth started to spill out, following the subway's snaking lines across the river, into Brooklyn and Queens. ""Developers build things where the subway works, and we build far fewer things where it doesn't,"" Jed Walentas, the 43-year-old principal of the real estate development company Two Trees Management, told me recently over lunch at a cafe in Dumbo, Brooklyn's answer to SoHo. ""We put density where there's transit."" Walentas, who was wearing the familiar Brooklyn uniform of jeans, New Balance sneakers and a blue hoodie, and his father, David, own a good chunk of Dumbo, an investment that has made them rich — house in the Hamptons, vacations heli-skiing — beyond the wildest dreams of most New Yorkers. I've known Walentas since the early 2000s, when I rented a desk in one of his many buildings in the neighborhood, a turn-of-the-century factory that has since been converted into multimillion-dollar condominiums. This is pretty representative of Dumbo's overall trajectory over the last two decades. It's a stark transformation that would have been impossible to predict when his father first started buying up the neighborhood's underutilized properties in the early 1980s, before it was widely known as Dumbo. What enabled it to happen wasn't just the neighborhood's excellent subway access — it's sandwiched between the F line and the A line — or the city's economic recovery, or even the exodus of rich people priced out of Manhattan by even richer people. The transformation of Dumbo required something much simpler: a change in the zoning law. For years, the neighborhood had been restricted to only manufacturing uses, a legacy of the city's losing battle to retain industrial jobs in the 1960s. In the late '90s, Walentas and his father were able to persuade the city to jettison these old rules and allow them to completely remake the neighborhood, filling old factories with loft apartments, design-and-tech-centric offices, retail stores, artists' studios and new condo towers. In the subsequent 20 years, as the neighborhood changed, average condo prices rose from $200 per square foot to more than $1,500. More recently, Walentas has pushed north into Williamsburg, leveraging similar rezonings there to turn a former textile factory into the trendy Wythe Hotel (near the L train) and a 19th-century Domino sugar refinery (J, M and Z) into three million square feet of office space, retail stores, parks and apartments. Like most good-government tools, zoning sounds boring, but it is in fact a secret means by which cities are shaped and fortunes are made. If the subway delivers density, zoning determines where that density goes by doing things like placing limits on how tall buildings can rise or how many dwellings they can contain. New York's zoning codes are byzantine, the product of years of pushing and pulling between the desire to allow the city to evolve and grow and the impulse to keep development in check. These codes have helped preserve the city's historic buildings and neighborhoods while preventing its streets from being forever cast into darkness by endless rows of skyscrapers. But they have also had the effect of restricting the supply of housing, which has driven up prices, especially in neighborhoods with desirable buildings and good subway access. ""I rent studio apartments for $3,400 a month,"" Walentas told me. ""It doesn't make any sense."" New York is facing an affordable-housing crisis. In response, the city is incentivizing developers to build below-market-rate housing with property-tax exemptions, while also adding regulations that require them to incorporate more affordable housing into their higher-end projects. But securing one of these affordable units is not easy. Of the roughly 2,300 apartments in Walentas's Domino project, about 700 will be reserved for lower-income tenants. The first 105 affordable units were recently made available at monthly rents ranging from $590 to $964; 87,000 people entered the lottery for them. Walentas is a developer. If you want housing to be more affordable, he says, build more houses. ""The way to put downward pressure on rents is not to have fear of making things better,"" he told me. ""It's to make things so pervasively better that people have more choices."" In his words, it's ""insane"" that so little of the wealth that the subway generates flows back into the system. In Hong Kong, the company that runs the subway also controls the property around it, earning huge amounts that it can then reinvest in service enhancements. The M.T.A., by contrast, is largely cut out of the land profiteering that it enables: Of the authority's roughly $16 billion budget in 2017, about $460 million came from a tax on residential real estate transactions. An additional $520 million came from a tax on commercial sales. To put those numbers in perspective, several years ago, a group of economists calculated that the land in New York City — just the land, not the buildings on it — was worth about $2.5 trillion. One thing New York City has plenty of is money, and much of it is bound up in real estate, a kind of blank canvas with unlimited economic promise. Toward the end of our lunch, I asked Walentas a hypothetical question: What if the M.T.A. could offer the real estate community development rights as a kind of bargaining chip? Would it underwrite subway upgrades and expansions into underserved areas in exchange? ""Oh, yeah,"" he said without hesitating. ""It's just math. You can make the money come right out of the air with a pencil."" The subway has made a lot of people very rich. And without carefully constructed zoning laws that foster inclusive growth, it can create the kind of gentrification that contributes to America's growing income divide. That divide has been especially acute in New York City. The Fiscal Policy Institute, an economic think tank, reports that between 1980 and 2015, the share of the country's income going to the wealthiest 1 percent increased from 10 percent to 22 percent. In New York City, it went from 12.2 percent to 40.9 percent. The subway can help narrow that divide by doing what subways do best: increasing density. For all the recent growth in neighborhoods like Dumbo and Williamsburg, large pockets of the city remain underpopulated and underdeveloped. Many of these neighborhoods already have good subway access. One of them is in a section of Brooklyn called East New York. East New York is predominantly black and Hispanic, with a small South Asian community. Its median household income is about $35,000, and some 35 percent of its 35,000 or so residents live below the federal poverty level. East New York was gradually hollowed out by the same cycle of disinvestment that ate away at a lot of formerly middle-class neighborhoods in New York and other American cities over the course of the 1960s and '70s. The city's manufacturing jobs had disappeared, and the white middle-class flight from the neighborhood was underway, helped along by avaricious real estate brokers who issued alarmist warnings about East New York's future. In the process, East New York became a victim of what economists call spatial, or geographic, inequality: As its population shrank and its demographics changed, stores closed and city services declined, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. And so for the most part it remained, until recently, when the gentrification that had been pushing east across Brooklyn along the L train began to creep into East New York. A neighborhood that had long been starved of resources was now in danger of being hit by a wave of development that could push out longtime residents. What was to be done? The answer will be a kind of grand experiment in urban planning, made possible, of course, by the subway. East New York was recently rezoned to invite both residential and commercial development to revive the neighborhood, but with a combination of regulations and incentives that will ensure that half of the nearly 6,000 units of new housing would be affordable. This time, as the subway draws new residents to a neighborhood, the city will take a stronger hand in shaping its demographics and trying to ensure that its existing population isn't priced out. The hope is that the whole neighborhood will become more dense, and the resulting prosperity will be widely shared. All with just the stroke of a pencil and the subway. The concept dates to Mayor Michael Bloomberg's era, when the Obama administration awarded New York a grant for cities looking to build more affordable housing near mass transit. De Blasio has now turned it into an early cornerstone of his promise to build or preserve 300,000 affordable apartments around the city. In addition to the subsidies it will provide to developers, the city has pledged to contribute $250 million to building schools, parks and a new community center in the neighborhood. ""This sort of targeted investment has never been done before in any community,"" the local City Council member, Rafael Espinal, told me as we toured the neighborhood on a recent afternoon. Espinal, the son of Dominican immigrants, grew up in the adjoining neighborhood of Cypress Hills and was an important advocate for the rezoning, over the objections of some who argued that the increased development would only accelerate gentrification in East New York. ""If we didn't move forward with this plan, the reality is that people here would have been displaced,"" he said as we passed the construction site for one of the neighborhood's first new developments, Chestnut Commons. It's a mixed-used development built around an apartment complex with 274 units of affordable housing; more than 80 units will be set aside for households earning up to $25,770, some of them specifically reserved for formerly homeless families. We ended up back at the Broadway Junction subway station, the inspiration for the rezoning plan and the home to five different lines and a stop on the Long Island Rail Road. Broadway Junction is dark, dingy and overcrowded. Some 100,000 people pass through this station every day, and yet the blocks surrounding it are largely barren. The rezoning plan envisions a rebuilt Broadway Junction as the commercial anchor for the whole project. It takes some imagination, but if you squint hard enough, you can see it: a brightly lit, newly renovated transit hub, providing the density needed for retail stores, office space and government and academic institutions, bringing new economic energy to the neighborhood and — while we're imagining things — a much better subway for the people who live in East New York. The revitalized blocks around Broadway Junction — desirable to people with more money, affordable to people with less — would reduce spatial inequality and provide current residents new jobs. And with a faster, more reliable subway, those same residents could also commute more quickly not just to Manhattan but to hospitals, nursing homes, health care clinics and community colleges in the outer boroughs, the source of a lot of the city's more recent job growth. In New York, transit dictates opportunities. The case for the subway is the case for mobility: physical mobility, economic mobility, social mobility. The business leaders, politicians and engineers who made the subway all those years ago understood that promise, and it remains the most profound message of the system even in its decline: The city can be built, and the people can come, and they can thrive — millions of them, then millions more. That revelation has sustained us for more than a century, and some among us still see within our broken subway the stubborn glimmers of genius. When Max Diamond was a preschooler in Park Slope in the late 1990s, he turned his wooden train set into an exact replica of his local line, complete with all four tracks and the accurate location of each switch. By the time he was 8, he could identify and describe in detail all the different types of cars in the subway system. By the time he was 11, he knew the track layout of the entire system, not just the different stops on the different lines, but the hundreds of places where the tracks connect and the precise locations of the multitude of switches and signals. In the eighth grade, he started his own YouTube channel, where his subway videos, which he posts under the handle Dj Hammers, made him something of a celebrity among subway buffs. In 2016, Diamond was hired by the M.T.A. as a paid intern, and at 21, he now crunches numbers in its performance-analysis unit while he works toward an economics degree at the City College of New York. We met one fall afternoon at the Fulton Street station in Manhattan, just a short walk from the M.T.A.'s headquarters, and boarded a Brooklyn-bound J train — an R42, he said, dating to 1969. We got on the first car, moving quickly to the large picture window at the front of the train, as has been Diamond's custom since he was a toddler, and wended our way through the tunnels beneath Lower Manhattan before emerging into the fading sunlight on the elevated tracks across the Williamsburg Bridge. Like most regular riders, I tend to think of the subway as a necessary evil, the least worst way to get where I'm going, which made it a little disorienting to spend time with someone who rides the subway for fun. But in its early years, hundreds of thousands of people did just that every Sunday. According to the historian Clifton Hood, it was called ""doing the subway."" Diamond calls it ""railfanning."" The subway is a very different sort of marvel today. What's miraculous at this point is that it still works at all. The fact that it does, that even after decades of neglect it is still somehow managing to carry New York's economy on its back, may be the best argument for giving it everything it needs, and then a whole lot more. And what is the alternative? Here's one possible scenario: New York won't die, but it will become a different place. It will happen slowly, almost imperceptibly, for years, obscured by the prosperity of the segment of the population that can consistently avoid mass transit. But gradually, an unpleasant and unreliable subway will have a cascading effect on New Yorkers' relationship with their city. Increasingly, we will retreat; the infinite possibilities of New York will shrink as the distances between neighborhoods seem to grow. In time, businesses will choose to move elsewhere, to cities where public transit is better and housing is cheaper. This will depress real estate values, which will make housing more affordable in the short term. But it will also slow growth and development, which will curtail job prospects and deplete New York's tax base, limiting its ability to provide for citizens who rely on its public institutions for opportunity. The gap between rich and poor will widen. As the city's density dissipates, so too will its economic energy. Innovation will happen elsewhere. New York City will be just some city. That doesn't have to happen. The subway still exists, and the people who operate it still bring a kind of subtle genius to their work. As we rode deeper into Brooklyn, Diamond told me about something he had seen the night before. He had been monitoring the Yankees' playoff game on the internet, not because he cares about baseball but because the heavy crowds during the postseason often spur rare service patterns. His instinct was right. ""Trains started at Yankee Stadium and went down the D line to 36th Street, then switched over to the N line to Coney Island, then continued through the Coney Island terminal, before switching to the Q line to Brighton Beach,"" Diamond told me. This sort of move wouldn't be possible in most other cities, where subway lines operate independently, but in New York they overlap and intersect, making a single, cohesive, interchangeable whole. ""It was actually pretty brilliant,"" he said in a reverent tone, as the blue sky in front of us began to darken."
News,2018-01-03,SHANGHAI — One new drug promises to stop cancer from spreading to other organs. Another would treat blood cancer. A third would use the body’s immune system to kill tumors.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/business/china-drugs-health-care.html,1204," SHANGHAI — One new drug promises to stop cancer from spreading to other organs. Another would treat blood cancer. A third would use the body's immune system to kill tumors. All three show encouraging results, and need just one more step to be approved for use in the United States. The drugs have something else in common: They were created in China. For years, China's drug industry concentrated on replicating Western medicines. Getting new drugs approved was a frustrating and time-consuming process. Companies thought plowing millions of dollars into research and development was risky and stuck to safer revenue streams. The country is now pushing to play a bigger role in the global drug industry. Millions of people in China have cancer or diabetes, and the government has made pharmaceutical innovation a national priority. Officials have promised to speed up drug approvals, and to reverse a brain drain by luring scientists back home. The authorities are providing land, grants and tax breaks, and investing in research. The three new drugs will have to clear American regulatory hurdles. If they do, they can stand as proof of China's growing ability to produce cutting-edge treatments, part of a broader transformation of the country's economy as it moves into higher-value and increasingly complex sectors. China's drug development is in the earliest stages compared to the broader industry. Some experts say, however, that it is only a matter of time before China's medical companies stand alongside Big Pharma giants like Pfizer and AstraZeneca. ""It's not whether they are going to,"" said Jonathan Wang, senior managing director of OrbiMed Asia, a health care investment fund. ""They are going to."" For now, access to quality drugs remains a problem in China. Many people buy medicines from Hong Kong and Macau — territories governed by separate laws. Online forums are devoted to discussing smuggling generics from India. Others buy the raw ingredients to make the drugs at home. Those who can afford it fly to the United States. A growing number of companies are trying to address that shortfall. Hutchison China MediTech, a firm backed by Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, started out in 2000 trying to develop the herbal drugs used in traditional Chinese medicine. In 2005, the company, known as Chi-Med, started developing cancer drugs. At its main laboratory in Shanghai, upward of 350 scientists are surrounded by rodents in testing rooms. More than half the scientists are at work trying to discover new drugs. In October, Chi-Med reported that more than 60 percent of patients in second-stage clinical trials had responded positively to its drug, savolitinib, which it is developing together with AstraZeneca. Savolitinib — the first drug of its kind — can be used to treat lung, kidney, gastric and colorectal cancers; it is often used in combination with other AstraZeneca drugs to shut down pathways that allow the cancer to spread. Chi-Med is awaiting more data. But if further tests get positive results, the company will apply for what is known as breakthrough therapy designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration. It still needs to run Phase 3 trials, the last step before seeking full approval from the F.D.A., but breakthrough therapy status would allow the final stage to be sped up. The trials involve drugs being tested, often against placebos, for their safety and effectiveness on as many as several thousand patients. Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research, said that based on the industry average, the probability of success in Phase 3 trials is 60 to 70 percent. If all goes according to plan, regulatory approval could come in late 2019, at the earliest, said Christian Hogg, Chi-Med's chief executive. ""It takes 20 years to get an overnight success, and that's where we are at the moment,"" he said. The last time China produced a new drug for the global pharmaceutical industry was in the 1970s, when the Chinese scientist Tu Youyou was credited with the discovery of artemisinin after Mao Zedong asked her to come up with a cure for malaria. But global recognition did not come until much later, after the Swiss drug maker Novartis bought the Chinese patent and started producing it in the late 1990s. Ms. Tu was eventually awarded a Nobel Prize in 2015. That is changing. Along with Chi-Med, another company, BeiGene, is already in Phase 3 trials globally for a drug used to treat a variety of lymphomas, the most common form of blood cancer, and an immunotherapy drug that aims to destroy tumors. It has also teamed up with Celgene and Merck to develop cancer drugs. Ms. Carney said she expected 20 or 30 Chinese-made drugs to seek Phase 3 trials in the United States, the world's biggest market for cancer drugs, within the next five years. Those that make it through will very likely be cheaper than those made by foreign companies, she said, based on current pricing patterns in China. Meanwhile, Big Pharma is shrugging off its long-held fears of China's rampant counterfeiting and cumbersome bureaucracy and setting up its own labs here. Johnson & Johnson, Novartis and Sanofi have all opened research centers in Shanghai to create drugs for Chinese patients. Executives say that the government has made inroads in toughening protections of pharmaceutical patents. And the pace of approvals has also quickened. In worst-case scenarios, drug companies needed to wait up to two years to get permission just to start clinical trials, which would then take several more years. The comparable waiting period in the United States is typically 30 days. Under Bi Jingquan, who was appointed the head of China's Food and Drug Administration in 2015, the agency has begun cracking down on companies making low-quality drugs and agreed to accept foreign data for clinical trials. Now, thanks to those shifts, as well as incentives offered by the government, scientists trained overseas are returning to China. After 20 years in the United States with Eli Lilly and Pfizer, Joan Shen moved to Shanghai in 2011 to lead clinical trials for Pfizer. She now heads research and development for a Chinese biotech firm, I-Mab Biopharma. The local government has helped secure funding for the company, and provided laboratory space in a high-tech business park. ""The funds are chasing us,"" she said, comparing the investment environment between China and the United States, ""instead of us having to spend numerous hours convincing investors."" Despite the optimism, Chinese pharmaceutical companies that want to go abroad still face obstacles. Competition among drugmakers in major markets like the United States is intense, and Chinese companies are hamstrung in particular by a lack of money committed to research. Jiangsu Hengrui, a Chinese company that has been moving toward developing new drugs from making generic ones, has the largest research budget of all Chinese drug firms. But its $180 million annual outlay pales in comparison with the $7.8 billion that Pfizer spent in 2016. Still, with several drugs in early-stage testing, it is targeting what Zhang Lianshan, the company's head of research and development, described as its ""ultimate goal"": regulatory approval in the United States. ""If you have a drug approved by the U.S. F.D.A.,"" Mr. Zhang said, ""that's a true demonstration of innovation."""

Here's what you need to know: • President Trump again raised the prospect of nuclear war with North Korea, boasting on Twitter on Tuesday that he commands a ""much bigger"" arsenal than does Kim Jong-un, the North's leader, who claimed to ""have a nuclear button on the desk in my office."" (To be clear, no one has a button.) • Pyongyang reopened a hotline with South Korea today, restoring a channel for direct dialogue and signaling a possible thaw in relations. • Our correspondent in Tehran reports that an effort by President Hassan Rouhani to tap popular resentment worked. Perhaps too well. The president, a moderate, revealed last month that billions of dollars were going to the country's elite. The budget he leaked also proposed ending cash subsidies for millions of citizens and increasing fuel prices. The result: deadly demonstrations against the entire political establishment. Iranian state media, seeking to to calm nerves, broadcast images of pro-government demonstrations today. • President Trump has supported the antigovernment demonstrations, but the unrest complicates a decision on the future of the Iran nuclear deal. • Orrin Hatch of Utah — the Senate's longest-serving Republican — will retire at the end of the year, rebuffing President Trump's request that he seek re-election. The announcement opens the door for Mitt Romney, a critic of the president's, to run for the seat. (By Tuesday evening, Mr. Romney had updated his Twitter profile to change his location to Holladay, Utah, from Massachusetts.) • The Senate returns today, just weeks before a possible government shutdown. Newly emboldened Democrats have a list of demands, including the protection of young undocumented immigrants. • In the second part of our series examining the industry of addiction treatment, we look at the lucrative business of urine testing. It has long been a way for clinics to ensure that former drug users are staying clean. But with the opioid crisis and the expanded availability of insurance under the Affordable Care Act, urinalysis costs have soared. • We also examined  why the U.S. spends so much on health care. Said one Harvard physician: ""The U.S. just isn't that different from other developed countries in how much health care we use. It is very different in how much we pay for it."" • The ""Today"" show on NBC will have two women as its main hosts for the first time. Hoda Kotb will join Savannah Guthrie to replace Matt Lauer, who was fired over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. Separately, Vice Media placed its president and its chief digital officer on leave after accusations of sexual harassment. And the University of Arizona fired its football coach, Rich Rodriguez, after an investigation into misconduct. • China's largest shipping company has poured billions into buying seaports around the world. But the site of its latest big foreign investment is more than 1,600 miles from the ocean: Kazakhstan. • Researchers in Finland have developed artificial intelligence that can generate images of celebrity look-alikes — and another system that tests how believable they are. • U.S. stocks were up on Tuesday. Here's a snapshot of global markets. Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • We've long known that dietary fiber is good for us. New research explains why. • How smart a traveler are you? • Recipe of the day: Craving noodles? Try them with chicken, ginger and mushrooms. • The case for the subway It built New York City. Now, a writer for The Times Magazine says, it must be rebuilt if the city is to survive, regardless of the cost. • A crimp in colleges' revenue Many U.S. universities that had put the 2008 recession behind them are making new rounds of budget cuts, in large part because they have fewer international students, who generally pay more in tuition. Changing conditions abroad and tougher immigration policies in the U.S. have contributed to the decline, college administrators say. • In memoriam Thomas Monson, the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, enlarged the ranks of female missionaries but rebuffed demands to ordain women as priests. The Mormon leader also refused to alter the church's position on same-sex marriage. He was 90. John Portman, an architect and developer, revolutionized hotel designs with soaring futuristic atriums and transformed cityscapes around the world. He was 93. Rick Hall, a music producer, turned small-town Alabama into a crucible of soul, country, pop and rock with his studio in Muscle Shoals. He was 85. • Best of late-night TV Back from vacation, Stephen Colbert returned to one of his favorite targets: President Trump. • Quotation of the day ""I was an amateur boxer in my youth, and I've brought that fighting spirit with me to Washington. But every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching."" — Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, who announced he would not seek an eighth term. ""Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy … how can I ever forget them?"" Those were Charles M. Schulz's parting words in the final daily ""Peanuts"" comic strip, which ran 18 years ago today. They recalled a slightly less sentimental line from the strip's debut, nearly 50 years earlier, in which a carefree Charlie Brown strolls by a pair of children. ""Good ol' Charlie Brown,"" one says. ""How I hate him!"" That juxtaposition of earnestness and wry humor made ""Peanuts"" a pop-culture mainstay for half a century, appearing in 75 countries and 21 languages at its peak. Mr. Schulz insisted on producing every aspect of the comic, making himself inseparable from his characters. ""I want it to be my words in everything I do,"" he told The Times in 1967. ""I've thought of it — hiring someone to help. Sometimes I think it would be nice. But then — what would be the point?"" When colon cancer forced Mr. Schulz to end the daily strip in 2000, at age 77, The Times invoked a dismal Charlie Brown, mourning the end of the baseball season: ""There's a dreariness in the air that depresses me."" Mr. Schulz died a month later, but all 17,897 ""Peanuts"" strips were anthologized over the next two decades.

Hannah's courtroom: Those who stand on the far side of the bench to have their cases considered in the usual way, and those invited to step closer. Close enough to shake the judge's hand or shout obscenities in his face, depending on their mood that day. Both kinds are facing criminal charges, but those in the second group have volunteered to take part in an experiment where the primary goal is to save their lives. Arrested for crimes related to addiction, they are participants in what is believed to be the nation's first opioid court. Unlike typical drug courts, which can end in punishment if defendants relapse, this one recognizes that failure is part of the recovery process. Its measure of success — preventing death — is arguably a low bar. Then again, few initiatives have made much of a dent in an epidemic that is killing more people each year than car accidents do. The criminal justice system may not be the ideal place to address addiction, but the reality is that it is a place where drug users are a captive audience. And the court, by linking with nonprofits, offers treatment for those who could not otherwise afford it. Court systems around the country are watching Buffalo as a potential model. Participants are required to appear daily before Judge Hannah, who was himself once addicted to drugs. ""I'm going to be your new best friend,"" he tells them. ""So I'm going to start calling you by your first name from now on. See you tomorrow. Keep up the good work."" _____ Michael Marcinkowski's right leg twitches nervously. He's high again. When his name is called, he walks nervously toward Judge Hannah until he can no longer avoid looking him in the eye. ""What's going on? This doesn't look too good,"" the judge says. ""This is twice in a week, right?"" Michael, 21, avoids a direct answer. ""I've been going to a meeting every day. After the third day, I relapse."" Judge Hannah scans the file and begins speaking, as if to himself. ""Did I misread it? Because I went to a public school. I want to make sure I didn't misread it."" The room goes quiet. The young man fidgets. A bailiff is breathing over his shoulder. ""See that tall gentleman behind you?"" the judge says. ""I'm thinking about keeping you."" During a break, Michael says he sets a timer every 15 minutes to interrupt his urge to use. ""From midnight to 6 a.m., I'm screaming."" But the judge's options are limited: A locked inpatient treatment center or the Erie County jail. ""You may not like that kind of help,"" he says, telling him to come back tomorrow, clean. _____ Judge Hannah is a generation older than most of those who appear in his court. He was once hooked on cocaine, but stopped using drugs in his early 20s. In court, he does not speak in legal jargon. The defendants are his peers. He talks about the Bills, the city's popular football team, or the cold weather. He asks them how they are feeling, how he can help. He does not hurry anyone along. Friends ask him why opioid users, who are largely white, get gentler treatment than crack users, who were disproportionately black, did in the 1980s. ""I think we learned,"" says the judge, who is African-American. ""We locked up a generation of young black men, and then when they get out, they are dumped back in a community with no marketable skills. This time, people realized that this ain't just affecting the boys in the 'hood anymore."" His own addiction ruined his chance to become a Marine Corps officer. The night before his military physical to begin officer training, he used cocaine because, he said, ""I figured I could never get high again."" He didn't count on being drug-tested that morning. He walked out before the results came back. ""There's a shame in addiction. That's one thing we have to remove. Part of recovery is telling people that the only difference between you and them is time."" He presides in a city where the number of opioid overdose deaths, already high in 2015, more than doubled in 2016, to about 300. But aside from force of personality, he has few tools at his disposal. If defendants continue to use, they are returned to criminal court to face their charges. If they agree to treatment but no beds are available, they have to wait. No one can be required to take medications that would help quell their addictions. But if participants complete the program — which generally means going 60 days without drugs — they have a good chance of having their charges reduced or dropped altogether. Since the project started last May, only one of its 92 participants has died from an overdose. It is too early to tell if the others will stay clean. Judge Hannah acknowledges that the powerful opioids available now are far more ruthless than the drugs of his youth. ""This substance is a monster. It releases all your pleasure receptors all at one time. If the birth of your baby is an 8, and the best sex of your life is a 9.5, the first shot of heroin is a 4,000."" _____ Nicholas Schuh, 25, says he believed opioid court would be a waste of time. The alternative, though, was a painful detox behind bars. He had not been clean since age 15, when he started by stealing his mother's prescription painkillers. Though he had pledged to avoid shooting up, he eventually cajoled his brother, a heroin user, into injecting him. ""I told myself, if I ever shot up, my life would be over."" He wasn't wrong. He says he lost 10 jobs in a year. He crashed his car. He stole so much that one of his younger brothers finally installed a deadbolt on his own bedroom door. Nicholas overdosed twice; once, he left the hospital to score again. He was not a fan of Judge Hannah, who thought Nicholas's best hope was to check into a locked inpatient treatment facility, where rules are stricter than in many jails. ""I wanted to say, 'Did you go through inpatient?' He's never done that,"" Nicholas said. ""I felt I was being pushed into a corner."" But something finally clicked. He now receives an injection of Vivitrol, a drug that blocks opioid highs, every 30 days and has become a Christian. ""He has truly saved my life,"" he says of Judge Hannah. ""We have a relationship. So it isn't like going to see a judge you're scared of."" He pauses, surprised by his own words. ""I look forward to seeing that man every day."" _____ Last month, when Justin Schmidbauer's best friend died of a heroin overdose, his thoughts turned to getting high, threatening his nearly three months of sobriety. His life these days is spent seeking distractions from the urge to use: hanging out with his 11-year-old daughter, going fishing, attending 10 Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings a week. Justin, 36, refuses to use medications like Suboxone that help curb addiction and save lives. He views a drug-free recovery as a way to win back lost self-worth. Instead, when he gets a craving for heroin, he mentally plays what he calls ""the tape of consequences."" If he gets high, the tape goes, ""'Yeah, for five minutes I feel O.K., but everything I've worked for is gone.'"" In court, Judge Hannah says he heard about the death of Justin's friend. ""I was thinking about you, but the rules are I can't contact you outside court,"" the judge says. (To maintain impartiality, judges cannot speak privately with one side of a case, except through a lawyer.) Weeks later, Judge Hannah announces that Justin has successfully completed the program. Justin's charges, four counts of drug possession, are reduced to a single, noncriminal violation. His fellow defendants give him an ovation. He is on top of the world. Now comes the hard part."
News,2018-01-03,Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/business/dealbook/ant-financial-moneygram-trump.html,3192," Good Wednesday. Here's what we're watching: • Tesla pushes back its Model 3 production targets again. • Manafort's lawsuit faces a tough road. • Researchers discover two major flaws in the world's computers. • Spotify filed confidentially to go public. • The death of Ant Financial's bid to buy MoneyGram raises questions about how useful close ties to President Trump are. • Dominion Energy and Scana are combining. • Underwriting for free. Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. The electric carmaker said it delivered 1,550 Model 3s in the fourth quarter and would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter. Those numbers were well below analyst expectations and Tesla's past forecasts. In September, analysts predicted that Telsa would deliver 15,900 Model 3s in the fourth quarter. That number had come down since then. Prior to Wednesday's announcement, the consensus among analysts was 4,100, or more than double what Tesla actually delivered. Meanwhile, the forecast of 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter is half the number it had earlier promised. The company now says it will produce 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of the second quarter. Critics corner: ""The premise of the stock's sky-high valuation has long been of Tesla eventually dominating the auto industry. That notion has hardly ever seemed more fanciful,"" writes Heard on the Street's Charley Grant. The news hasn't spooked investors much. Shares are down just 2 percent after the close. Lawyers know that there are many paths to getting a good result. When one is blocked, then look for another one. The lawsuit filed by Paul J. Manafort Jr., the former campaign chairman for President Trump, against the Justice Department, deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein, and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is an effort to find a backdoor way to block the criminal charges filed against him last October. The Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear, most recently in 2014 in Kaley v. United States, that defendants cannot attack a grand jury indictment by claiming that they are innocent. That's what a trial is for, so once indicted the only alternative is to go to trial. But that's a risky path, especially for Mr. Manafort who will face a jury from Washington, D.C., a venue that is not very hospitable to Republicans. To avoid a trial, Mr. Manafort asked the court to stop the case because it is unrelated to any Russian interference with the 2016 election. The lawsuit claims that Mr. Mueller exceeded the limits of his appointment as special counsel, comparing the indictment to the discredited independent counsel law that led to drawn out investigations of President Bill Clinton and others in the 1990s. Can it work? Federal judges have a strong aversion to interfering with prosecutors, routinely refusing to second guess decisions about who to prosecute and what to charge. So Mr. Manafort faces a tough road if he wants to find a means to block Mr. Mueller from dragging him into court. Deciding whether one is guilty is usually left to the jury, not a judge saying who should and shouldn't be prosecuted. — Peter J. Henning Those are the names of two major security flaws found in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world's computers. The Meltdown flaw affects virtually every Intel microprocessor, which are used in more than 90 percent of computer servers. Spectre affects most other processors now in use, though the researchers believe this flaw is more difficult to exploit. From Cade Metz and Nicole Perloth of the NYT: ""The two problems could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of a computer. There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent — an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services."" The business implications are unclear for chip makers, who may have to eventually swap out all affected hardware to eradicate the threats. The researchers notified the affected companies but had tried to keep the news from the public so hackers could not take advantage of the flaws before they were fixed. The Register, a British science and technology website, reported news of the Meltdown flaw, spurring the researchers to release papers describing the flaws much earlier than they had planned. Intel's shares fell 3.4 percent Wednesday. Rivals Advance Micro Devices and Nvidia jumped 5.2 percent and 6.6 percent respectively. The tax overhaul signed into law last month should boost corporate bottom lines. The bad news? The gains could be shortlived. Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its 2018 earnings forecast for the Standard & Poor's 500 index to $153 from $139. ""The biggest impact on earnings from tax reform comes from the lowering of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, making up roughly $10 of the $14 increase. Buybacks representanother $3 of the increase, with some modest offsets from the minimum foreign tax rate and the cap on interest deductions."" But tax reform may weigh on corporate profits in 2019.The bank forecasts earnings of $161 in 2019. ""While tax reform should provide a big boost to 2018 earnings growth, there are several reasons to expect it to be a headwind to growth in subsequent years. First, economic theory suggests that higher returns should incentivize additional competition, which should have a negative impact on margins over time, especially with many traditional industries already facing increasing disruption. Second, stronger growth could result in more aggressive Fed tightening, which could eventually weigh on overall economic growth."" Which sectors stand to get biggest earnings boost this year from the cut to the corporate tax rate? consumer discretionary and telecom. Why? The two sectors generate more of their revenue domestically and have a higher average tax rate. Not Spotify it seems. The music streaming service filed confidentially to go public through a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, according to reports. The NYT reported in May that the company was leaning toward such a listing. A direct listing is exceedingly rare and bypasses the traditional initial public offering process that virtually every other company uses to begin trading on the markets. Direct listings essentially move trading in a company's stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing. By eschewing an I.P.O., Spotify is not seeking to raise additional money. Wall Street and Silicon Valley will watch Spotify's listing closely. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. Wall Street is unlikely to cheer such a development. Direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O. That's essentially what is happening in Asia. The Wall Street Journal reports that three state-owned Indian companies paid a dollar in underwriting fees to seven banks, including Barclays and Standard Chartered, for their work selling a total of $1.3 billion in dollar-denominated bonds. While those fees may be unusually low, they highlight a trend in the region: ""Underwriting revenue, while also up from a year ago, isn't keeping up with the accelerating pace of Asian corporate bond issuance. That is raising concerns that underwriting ""could become largely unprofitable"" in Asia. In the United States, companies, on average, pay fees of 0.7 percentage point for an investment-grade corporate bond issue and 1.2 percentage points for underwriting a junk bond offering.  So much for the charm offensive last year by Jack Ma: U.S. officials have effectively killed a $1.2 billion takeover bid by one of his companies for MoneyGram. The failure of Ant Financial, an electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, to win approval from an American national security watchdog raises questions of how much being friendly to President Trump ultimately helps. If it's true that White House officials are clashing over how hard a negotiating stance to take with countries like China over trade, this development suggests that the hawks might have the upper hand right now. Who should be worried • Foreign companies, particularly Chinese ones, seeking to buy American counterparts. (Think also of Broadcom, which is legally headquartered in Singapore and which is pursuing Qualcomm — and has assiduously courted Mr. Trump.) • Domestic companies looking to merge in contested situations, despite having unofficial support from the president. (Think Disney and Fox, whose proposed transaction raised antitrust concerns but garnered praise from Mr. Trump.) • American companies looking to do business in China, who may now face retaliatory blowback. Critics' corner • Lex writes, ""With the demise of this payments merger, any Chinese company wanting to buy anything of significance in the U.S. should give up."" (Lex) • Richard Beales writes, ""If it's a rebuke, it's one that's conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment."" (Breakingviews) Dominion Energy has agreed to buy Scana Corporation in an all-stock deal valued at $14.6 billion, including debt. Scana shareholders will receive 0.669 shares of Dominion Energy for each share held. That's about $53.71 a share based on Dominion's stock price at Tuesday's close and a 28 percent premium. Shares of Scana jumped 22 percent on the news, while Dominion slipped 4 percent. Scana has struggled since this summer when it abandoned two unfinished nuclear reactors in South Carolina. The project was once expected to showcase advanced nuclear technology but was plagued by delays and cost overruns. Scana's shares are down more than 40 percent since midsummer. Height Securities via Axios warns that the deal has ways to go before it closes. ""In this case especially, Dominion will have to pull out all the stops to demonstrate that their offer is the best deal for customers, particularly given the uncertainty facing [SCANA's] rates over the coming months. We're looking for a reaction from the Governor as well as House Speaker Jay Lucas and the PSC commissioners for early signs of whether Dominion's proposal will fall flat."" Where Bitcoin traded early yesterday: $13,833 Where Bitcoin is trading this morning: $15,202 What happened: It was probably the revelation that the venture capitalist Peter Thiel has made a big bet on the digital currency. From Rob Copeland of the WSJ: Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm's most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments. Has Founders Fund made money? The WSJ reports, citing unidentified sources, that the firm bought about $15 million in Bitcoin and that its stake is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Bitcoin flyaround • John O'Rourke, the head of Riot Blockchain, a small biotech-turned-digital currency company, has made at least $712,000 on price increase of more than 60 percent after the company added blockchain to its name. (CNBC) • The penny-stock company TGI Solar Power Group enjoyed a surge in its stock price (though not quite what Long Blockchain, nee Long Island Iced Tea, experienced last month) after it announced a move into digital currencies. Its stock went as high as 0.2 cent. (Bloomberg) • Speaking of Long Blockchain, the company has added two new board members as part of its pivot from cold beverages to cryptocurrency. (WSJ) • Criminals are turning to a new breed of virtual currency, because Bitcoin's underlying technology can work against them. (Bloomberg) It isn't just the fact that Mitt Romney, a sometimes vociferous critic of the president, is expected to run for Mr. Hatch's Senate seat. It's that another Republican lawmaker who has been relatively friendly to Mr. Trump is stepping down before the 2018 midterm elections — which could whittle down the G.O.P.'s control of Congress. More from Jonathan Martin of the NYT: Mr. Romney's potential ascent is particularly alarming to the White House because the former presidential candidate has an extensive political network and could use the Senate seat as a platform to again seek the nomination. Even if he were not to run again for president, a Senator Romney could prove a pivotal swing vote, impervious to the entreaties of a president he has scorned and able to rally other Trump skeptics in the chamber. He's running, probably: While Mr. Romney didn't issue a statement on his potential candidacy, he did change his location on Twitter from ""Massachusetts"" to ""Holladay, Utah."" Also worth noting The Washington flyaround • Republican and Democratic lawmakers will meet today with White House officials to try and reach a spending deal before Jan. 19 — or face a government shutdown. (NYT) • The founders of the research firm Fusion GPS, which has been at the heart of the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, criticized Republican attacks on those inquiries in an NYT Op-Ed. (NYT) • American Airlines and Southwest Airlines joined the tide of companies offering employees $1,000 bonuses. (Bloomberg) • BP said it would take a roughly $1.5 billion accounting charge for its latest quarter because of the tax overhaul. (WSJ) • Jack Lew, the former Treasury secretary, described the tax overhaul as a ""ticking time bomb"" and asserted that it could leave the U.S. broke. (Bloomberg) • Michele Bachmann, the former Minnesota congresswoman and 2012 Republican presidential candidate, said she was considering running for Al Franken's Senate seat. (Axios) • Vice Media placed its president, Andrew Creighton, and its chief digital officer, Mike Germano, on leave after the NYT reported on sexual harassment allegations against them. (NYT) • The Showtime political documentary series ""The Circus"" will return in April without its most recognizable star, Mark Halperin, whose career was felled by allegations of sexual harassment and assault. He will be replaced by the CBS News anchor Alex Wagner and the political analyst Mark McKinnon. (NYT) • Pete Wells asks who can clean up the restaurant industry and wonders when prominent restaurant figures will admit that the way the industry treats women has damaged careers and lives. (NYT) Oil is at its highest level since 2015, edging up this morning toward $67 a barrel. Geopolitical risks, like protests in Iran, have prompted buying, while production curbs by OPEC members have tightened supply. That rise is expected to continue. More from David Sheppard of the FT: While global oil demand is forecast to rise by about 1.4m barrels a day next year, growing US shale output combined with new projects in Brazil and Canada are broadly expected to see non-OPEC supply rise by a similar amount. Hedge funds are, however, betting that prices are likely to head higher, with some arguing that geopolitical unrest — including in OPEC member Venezuela, where oil output has been falling — should keep prices well supported. Blackstone's Byron Wien reckons that ""populism, tribalism and anarchy"" could push oil above $80 a barrel this year. The hedge fund's latest victory: Alexion Pharmaceuticals said that it would work with the activist investor on finding a new director for its board. From a statement by David Brennan, Alexion's chairman: We have been actively working to expand and diversify our board, and we welcome input from Elliott to identify a strong director candidate to further strengthen Alexion's board. The context: Michael broke the news last month that Elliott had built up a stake in the drug maker and was weighing a proxy fight if the company didn't change elements of its business strategy. The broader landscape: For companies under pressure from activists, resistance requires deft maneuvering, according to Breakingviews. Procter & Gamble's expensive, hard-line defense against Nelson Peltz failed, but both G.M. and Automatic Data Processing have shown that fending off hedge funds is possible. ""It's like your neighbor having a suitcase stuffed with $1 million in cash, but you'll only pay him $500,000 for it because you think he'll lose the rest on the way to your house."" — Bloomberg, describing how SoftBank's relatively modest market value reflects continued skepticism of Masayoshi Son. • Amazon could buy Target this year, the tech analyst Gene Munster predicted. (Loup Ventures) • Wixen Music Publishing, which manages songs by Tom Petty and Stevie Nicks, is suing Spotify for $1.6 billion, saying the streaming service used thousands of songs without a proper license. (Variety) • A young man with life-threatening cancer was granted a wish to go anywhere or meet anyone. He chose to meet JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon. (Business Insider) • Big deals are poised to return in 2018, but they may not fit so neatly into industry or sector categories. (Bloomberg) • In the final weeks of 2017, business loan growth fell to its lowest levels since the aftermath of the financial crisis, a change that could weigh on bank earnings this month. (WSJ) • Snapchat's New Year's Eve party was meant to be an ""offline"" experience, so the company blocked snaps coming from the venue. Employees took to Instagram instead. (The Daily Beast) • Airbnb defeated a lawsuit brought by Apartment Investment & Management, which accused the home-renting marketplace of enabling tenants to break their lease agreements through unauthorized sublets. (Bloomberg) • Lyft has teamed up with the self-driving software company Apriv and will be showing off a fully-automated ride-hailing service at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this month. (Bloomberg) • Michael Gelband, the former head of credit at Millennium Management, plans to start his own hedge fund in the next six months, after resolving a hiring dispute with Millennium's founder, Izzy Englander. (Bloomberg) • China is suspending the production of more than 500 car models that do not meet its fuel economy standards as part of efforts to reduce emissions in the world's largest auto market. (NYT) • The practice of putting nursing homes and related businesses in separate limited liability corporations and partnerships has gained popularity as the industry has consolidated, making it harder to hold owners personally responsible if something goes wrong. (NYT) • The pharmaceutical industry may be under attack over drug prices, but the problem has splintered and made it difficult to identify who is responsible. Meanwhile, Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner, has been following through on the president's fiery rhetoric about rising drug prices.

News,2018-01-03,"A powerful winter storm dealt a chilly blow to the Southeastern United States on Wednesday as Floridians marveled at the rare sight of snow and officials warned of icy roads and dangerously low temperatures. All the while, residents of the Northeast prepared for windy, whiteout conditions and potential power losses.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/cold-weather-winter-storm.html,1642," A powerful winter storm dealt a chilly blow to the Southeastern United States on Wednesday as Floridians marveled at the rare sight of snow and officials warned of icy roads and dangerously low temperatures. All the while, residents of the Northeast prepared for windy, whiteout conditions and potential power losses. The storm, referred to by some meteorologists as a ""bomb cyclone"" for its sudden drop in atmospheric pressure, prompted flight cancellations up and down the East Coast and forced dozens of school districts to cancel or delay classes along the path of the storm, including New York City schools. It was expected to bring more headaches to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast overnight when New York City was forecast to receive five to eight inches of snowfall and up to 10 inches in Queens and Nassau Counties. The National Weather Service said blizzard warnings would take effect along the Virginia coast Wednesday, with travel ""very dangerous to impossible"" in the highly populated Hampton Roads region, which they said could receive up to 12 inches of snow in places. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia declared a state of emergency. Blizzard conditions were expected to begin on Thursday in parts of Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, according to forecasters. ""We've got plenty of bags of rock salt,"" said Vic Kintanar, the manager of Waterman's Surfside Grille, a restaurant by Virginia Beach's boardwalk, hours before the storm hit. Workers had already closed off patio sections and were preparing for a smaller-than-usual crowd on Thursday. Though much of the South is accustomed to occasional winter snowfalls, Wednesday's storm was setting records, and setting teeth on edge, in a region where even a couple of inches of snow has the potential to hobble an entire metropolis — as was the infamous case in Atlanta in 2014, when a mess of snow and ice stranded thousands of cars on major roads for hours. In Georgia, where Gov. Nathan Deal declared an emergency for 28 southern counties, snow fell across rural areas and in Savannah, a city that normally swelters. On Wednesday, Savannah's temperature hovered in the 20s as the city recorded about an inch of snow. In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency, and his office said the National Guard was on standby. The Raleigh-Durham area tied a record low of 9 degrees that had been set in 1887. Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said the storm would move beyond his state overnight, but he warned that temperatures would remain frigid through the weekend. Mr. McMaster urged residents to ensure people and pets were safe. ""If they can't get into heat, they'll freeze to death, and they'll be gone,"" he said. ""And the same thing will happen to people who are outside."" At a grocery store in Charleston, S.C., Chris Brown, a father of two daughters, stocked up on food to prepare to be snowed in. ""I can't believe how heavy it is,"" he said of the snow. ""I'm heading home to play with the kids."" The new round of shivering prolonged what has already been a difficult period in the country's emergency rooms. In the Atlanta area, where temperatures were hovering around freezing on Wednesday but were expected to plunge into the teens after nightfall, doctors said they had been seeing an unusual number of patients with weather-related emergencies. ""This is the most challenging winter, in terms of exposure, that I've ever seen,"" said Dr. Brooks Moore, the assistant medical director of the emergency department at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta's public hospital. Dr. Moore said about 20 people were arriving at the emergency room each day with minor complaints related to the weather, and that about the same number were appearing with conditions like asthma or emphysema that were exacerbated by the cold. He added that doctors were seeing more about one or two patients a day whose core body temperatures had fallen into the low 80s — normal is about 98.6 degrees — and required ""aggressive re-warming"" techniques. When discussing the storm, some weather forecasters have referred to a ""bomb cyclone."" Calling it a bomb sounds dire, but such storms are not exceedingly rare — there was one in New England recently. What makes a storm a bomb is how fast the atmospheric pressure falls; falling atmospheric pressure is a characteristic of all storms. By definition, the barometric pressure must drop by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours for a storm to be called a bomb cyclone. Here is how it works: Deep drops in barometric pressure occur when a region of warm air meets one of cold air. The air starts to move, and the rotation of the earth creates a cyclonic effect. The direction is counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere (when viewed from above), leading to winds that come out of the northeast — a Nor'easter. That's what happened at the end of October, when warm air from the remnants of a tropical cyclone over the Atlantic collided with a cold front coming from the Midwest. Among other impacts then, more than 80,000 electric customers in Maine lost power as high winds toppled trees. A similar effect was occurring Wednesday, as warm air over the ocean met extremely cold polar air that had descended over the East. Pressure was expected to fall quickly from Florida northward. The Times's Henry Fountain takes a look. Read more here. The Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with heavy snowfall and wind chills of up to -25 degrees expected. Kathryn Garcia, the commissioner of the Department of Sanitation in New York City, encouraged New Yorkers to avoid driving and use mass transit instead. The New York City Department of Education announced on Wednesday evening that all public schools would be closed on Thursday. It was the second time in a year that the city made an early call to close schools ahead of a storm. Last March, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced at noon the day before a predicted snowstorm that schools would be closed; in the end that storm was less severe than expected, but the mayor received little criticism for his caution. Chilly gusts of up to 50 m.p.h. are likely to whip eastern Long Island and southeastern Connecticut starting late Thursday morning, with the potential for downed tree limbs and scattered power failures, the National Weather Service said. For Bostonians, Wednesday's forecast high of 28 degrees was almost a welcome relief after days of temperatures that had hovered in or near the single digits. But it was quite literally cold comfort, with Thursday's storm expected to drop 10 to 14 inches of snow or more on the city and potentially create blizzard conditions along the New England coast. The storm will follow a long period of deep cold that has already taxed transit systems, fuel supplies and homeless shelters in the region. Residents were preparing while insisting they had been through worse. ""It's good to have at least four major meals ahead of you,"" said Forrest McFarland, a retiree from Cambridge, Mass., as he made the rounds at Market Basket, a busy grocery store in nearby Somerville. ""Since '78,"" he said, referring to the legendary blizzard that ground the Northeast to a halt, ""everybody stocks up."" Washington, too, remained firmly in the grip of a winter that has already proved treacherous. The District of Columbia government activated its cold emergency plan on Dec. 27, and on Wednesday, it extended it further. Around an inch of snow is expected in the morning, with a winter weather advisory in effect until 11 a.m. Thursday. While visiting, Hamlet Diaz, 38, said the temperatures were exactly what he was hoping for as his family drove home from an Ontario vacation to Pembroke Pines, Fla. ""We wanted to be cold,"" he said of his wife, Rachel, and two daughters. ""Right now, 8 degrees is what we want."" Snow even fell on Tallahassee, Florida's capital. More than 50 miles of Interstate 10 were closed in the Tallahassee area, as well as parts of Highway 90. Mark Wool, a Weather Service meteorologist, said that flurries seemed to come along every few years there. But the snow accumulation Wednesday — about a tenth to two-tenths of an inch — had not been seen since 1989. Geoff LeBaron, the director of Audubon's Christmas Bird Count, a kind of early-winter bird census that has been taking place since the year 1900, said that, fortunately, birds that could not effectively withstand cold snaps were already farther south than the continental United States. ""Warblers, thrushes, tanagers, they're down in Central and South America,"" he said. ""The birds that winter in the Southern U.S. are better able to withstand the temperatures and have more flexibility in terms of the food they can eat."" Mr. LeBaron said that waterfowl and marsh birds might be affected if there was significant snow cover or if water sources were frozen over. And he warned that the increasing number of hummingbirds that spend the winter in the South might be affected, and said that people who maintain the birds' feeders should keep the feeders warm and well supplied. But he said that the short amount of time the cold was expected to last would allow others to scrounge through.

The electric-car maker said on Wednesday that production of the new vehicle, the Model 3, in the final quarter of 2017 was far behind what its chief executive, Elon Musk, forecast when it went into production six months ago. Priced at $35,000, the Model 3 has been touted by Mr. Musk as an affordable, high-volume compact sedan that would enable Tesla to sell more than 500,000 cars a year starting in 2018. In July, Mr. Musk predicted that Tesla would be able to make 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. But in the past three months, it has built only 2,425. Over all, Tesla had the most productive year in its history, delivering 101,312 vehicles, a 33 percent increase from 2016. But production of the Model 3 was slowed by manufacturing glitches at Tesla's giant battery plant in Nevada, known as the Gigafactory. The company has also said that welding processes and final assembly tasks at its car factory in Fremont, Calif., were moving more slowly than expected. For Elon Musk's company, autonomous driving is just a pit stop on the road to a better planet. Can it survive long enough to get there? Of the Model 3s assembled in the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered 1,550 to customers, although many of the initial recipients were employees of the company. ""This is par for the course for Tesla and Elon Musk, whose history of stating goals and forecasts and not meeting them is pretty well established,"" said Karl Brauer, a senior director at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research company. ""That the Model 3 is moving slowly isn't a surprise. Most independent experts found the production rates he was forecasting were pretty unlikely."" Tesla shares fell 2 percent in extended trading after the announcement. In a statement, Tesla reported ""major progress addressing Model 3 production bottlenecks,"" adding that the production rate increased ""significantly"" toward the end of the quarter. In the last few days, it said, the company was nearing an assembly rate that would produce 1,000 Model 3s a week. That's still well short of Mr. Musk's forecast from last July, but well ahead of the pace in the third quarter, when just 260 Model 3s rolled off its assembly line. In addition to the Model 3, Tesla also delivered 15,200 Model S sedans and 13,120 Model X sport-utility vehicles in the fourth quarter. It said overall deliveries were 27 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company is counting on Model 3 sales to help it reach profitability. It has reported losses in most of the last several quarters as it spent heavily on research, product development and the Gigafactory. It also merged with a solar-panel company where Mr. Musk had served as chairman, and more recently outlined a new and potentially costly initiative to produce battery-powered trucks. Tesla has a long list of customers waiting to get a Model 3. In anticipation of a rapid start of mass production, Tesla has collected deposits of $1,000 for nearly 400,000 Model 3s from prospective customers."

Here's what you need to know: • A strong winter storm  tore through much of Europe, battering homes with hail and heavy rain, flooding streets and disrupting flights. At least one person was reported killed in France. (Above, a train carriage pushed off the tracks by wind gusts in Switzerland.) Expect more cold wind and rain in the coming days, but nothing to compare with Wednesday's. Meanwhile in the U.S., residents of the Northeast are preparing for power failures and travel disruption as a winter storm is forecast to prolong a stretch of bitter cold and record snow. (Climate change may be partly to blame.) _____ • In Tehran, Iran's capital, residents are sitting out the protests that have spread to other cities, unlike in 2009, when millions of middle-class people erupted in anger over an election they saw as rigged. The state news media gave copious coverage to orchestrated pro-government rallies as the authorities tried to re-establish order. There remains no evidence for Iranian leaders' claim that foreign meddling had instigated the protests, but history does offer reasons for such suspicion. European reluctance to side more openly with the protesters is the latest divergence of approach with the Trump administration, which has openly praised demonstrators. _____ • President Trump excommunicated his former chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, saying, in a written statement brimming with anger, that Mr. Bannon had ""lost his mind."" (Here's the full text.) Mr. Bannon is quoted in a new book saying that a Trump team meeting with Russians during the campaign was ""treasonous"" and that the special counsel in the Russia inquiry would ""crack Don Jr. like an egg on national TV."" Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, sued the special counsel, arguing that his investigation had exceeded its mandate. Separately, Mr. Trump ended an inquiry spurred by his false claims of voter fraud in the 2016 election. _____ • On his first working day in 2018, President Trump's 17 tweets offered a snapshot of his combative approach to this year's agenda. Among other things, Mr. Trump wrote that he wanted to tie Palestinian aid to peace talks. Many Israelis, even some who are generally critical of the Palestinians, see risks in that tactic. We took a closer look at the United Nations agency known as Unrwa, which handles much of that aid. _____ • Computer security experts have discovered two major security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world's mobile devices, personal computers and servers running in cloud computer networks. There is no evidence that hackers have taken advantage of the vulnerability, at least so far. • A growing number of Chinese pharmaceutical companies are trying to expand overseas, seeking U.S. regulatory approval to offer treatments for cancer and other ailments. • Iceland has started to put in place a new law requiring companies with 25 employees or more to prove that they are not paying women less than men. • Russia and Venezuela have floated plans to create homegrown virtual currencies that would put them outside the global financial and banking system. • Spotify's plans to file for an I.P.O. in New York could shine some light on the economics underlying streaming music. • Here's a snapshot of global markets. • The Koreas reopened a telephone hotline to prepare for talks on easing tensions and including the North in the Winter Olympics.

A new year can bring many changes, but 1999 saw what the Times's Op-Ed page called the ""most audacious gamble in the history of currency"": the launch of the euro, the common European currency. Almost 40 years in the works, the euro was toasted with champagne by finance ministers in the 11 countries where it debuted. Though euro bank notes and coins wouldn't be released until 2002, European banks were required to use the currency in transactions as soon as markets opened on Monday, Jan. 4. Fears of technical glitches meant banks brought in employees en masse: In Frankfurt, one bank alone had 3,200 people working to reprogram its computers. London had 30,000 workers on trading floors and in back offices, even though Britain wasn't even adopting the euro. The switch took more than a year of planning, months of rewriting software, and full-scale dress rehearsals. But the reward for the banking world's tireless efforts was simply a smooth debut when world markets opened for business. Others received something more concrete to mark the launch: For sharing a birthday with the new currency, each baby born in France on New Year's Day received 100 euros from the Finance Ministry.

News,2018-01-04,"SAN JUAN COUNTY, Utah — In this county of desert and sagebrush, Wilfred Jones has spent a lifetime angered by what his people are missing. Running water, for one. Electricity, for another. But worst of all, in his view, is that the Navajo people here lack adequate political representation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/native-american-voting-rights.html,1368," SAN JUAN COUNTY, Utah — In this county of desert and sagebrush, Wilfred Jones has spent a lifetime angered by what his people are missing. Running water, for one. Electricity, for another. But worst of all, in his view, is that the Navajo people here lack adequate political representation. So Mr. Jones sued, and in late December, after a federal judge ruled that San Juan County's longtime practice of packing Navajo voters into one voting district violated the United States Constitution, the county was ordered to draw new district lines for local elections. The move could allow Navajo people to win two of three county commission seats for the first time, overturning more than a century of political domination by white residents. And the shift here is part of an escalating battle over Native American enfranchisement, one that comes amid a larger wave of voting rights movements spreading across the country. ""It's a historic moment for us,"" said Mr. Jones, during a drive on the county's roller coaster dirt roads. ""We look at what happened with the Deep South,"" he went on, ""how they accomplished what they have. We can do the same thing."" The county is challenging the decision, arguing that the maps ordered by Judge Robert J. Shelby unconstitutionally consider race, and so discriminate against white voters. ""In one of the poorest counties in the nation, the last thing we need is to be constantly sued by these predatory attorneys,"" said Phil Lyman, a county commissioner. ""Outside people try to put this into a racial divide that simply doesn't exist in San Juan County."" Fights over indigenous voting rights are playing out in the West and the Midwest, a trend that has the potential to tip tight races in states with large native populations, like Alaska and Arizona, and to influence matters of national importance, like the future of Bears Ears National Monument, a conservation area in this county that is at the center of a fierce debate over public lands. Today, Native Americans are suing over a new voter identification law in North Dakota, where lawyers say there is not a single driver's license site on a reservation in a state that requires identification to vote. The outcome of the lawsuit could influence this year's congressional election, helping to secure or flip the seat of Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat with wide Native American support. In the battleground state of Nevada, the Pyramid Lake and Walker River Paiutes won a lawsuit in late 2016 that charged that tribal citizens had to travel as many as 100 miles to vote. The suit forced officials to open new polling stations in tribal areas and spurred nine other tribes to request their own election sites. And in Alaska, where native people make up a fifth of the population, officials recently rolled out election materials in the Yup'ik, Inupiaq and Gwich'in languages, following federal rulings that found the state had failed to provide materials equivalent to those used by English speakers. After those changes, turnout in villages rose by as much as 20 percent, increasing the political power of the state's native residents. Other native voting cases are proceeding or have been recently settled in Arizona, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming. And a second case is open in San Juan County, this one challenging the county's decision to move to an all-mail ballot. Plaintiffs contend this disenfranchises native people who live far from reliable mail service. ""It's part of a larger political trend of Native Americans organizing and protecting themselves,"" said Daniel McCool, a professor emeritus at the University of Utah and a voting rights expert who was hired by the plaintiffs in the Navajo redistricting case. There are 6.6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in the United States, representing about 2 percent of the population. But many live in America's most remote places — amid mountain passes or miles of near-empty plains — and the native path to the ballot box has often been less visible than that of other groups. It was not until 1924 that Congress granted native people the right to vote, and for generations afterward, local and state governments have blocked them from doing so, often saying that Native Americans living on reservations were not state residents. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a critical moment, prohibiting election practices that discriminate on the basis of race. But relatively few lawsuits were filed on behalf of native voters until the 1990s. The pace of legal challenges has picked up recently, something observers attribute to a realization that American Indians can influence local and national policy. The fate of Bears Ears, a conservation area that originally occupied a quarter of this 8,000-square-mile county, is one such issue. When President Trump slashed the size of the monument last month, one argument was that he was considering the desires of local officials. A Navajo-controlled commission, however, could oppose the decision, a move that could influence coming legal battles over the monument's fate. San Juan County is a hardscrabble expanse in the state's southeast corner, and home to some 16,000 people. The county population is about half Native American and half white, and battles over resources have often fallen along racial lines. The lower portion of the county overlaps the Navajo reservation, and native people bring millions of dollars to the county each year in the form of oil and gas revenue and other taxes. But those living on the reservation do not pay property taxes, frustrating many others who feel they pay more than their fair share. In the south, where most native families live, the library is in the corner of a trailer, there is no hospital or bank, and residents have spent more than a generation suing the county for services. Alicia Coggeshell, 52, lives in the south with two children and three grandchildren. She has no running water or internet service, and on a recent morning she traveled to the footbridge she uses to get to the market. These days, it is so dilapidated that her neighbors sometimes fall into the icy water below, she said. ""We asked the county and the county says, It's not our responsibility. This is what we mean: forgotten,"" she said. White families live mostly in the north, home to two expansive libraries, a community center on a golf course, a recreation center with a pool, and the seats of local power: the sheriff's office, the courthouse, the school administration building. Tauna Larson, a retired educator who lives in the north, said she looked at the possibility of two Navajo commissioners with some trepidation. ""I worry that they might tend to look out more for the reservation,"" she said. ""The majority tends to take care of their own."" The county also has a contentious relationship with the federal government, which controls 60 percent of the land here and has battled with local leaders over a range of issues, including the protection of Native American artifacts and access to a beloved public canyon. Commissioner Bruce Adams and Commissioner Lyman have been intensely critical of the federal government, and both said they believed the judge's decision was a punishment for their resistance. ""I think there is retribution,"" Mr. Adams said. ""We're tired of being the scapegoat, saying we're doing everything wrong, when we try to abide by the law."" Judge Shelby declined to comment. The old commission map made Native Americans about 30 percent of the population in two districts, and 93 percent in a third district. The new one makes them 66 percent in one district, 80 percent in another, and 11 percent in another. It will be used in a 2018 local election. Mr. Jones, the plaintiff in the case, is 62 and was born before most Native Americans could vote in the state. On a recent evening he pulled on a black cowboy hat and walked into a tribal meeting to explain the results of the lawsuit to a crowd. Kenny Victor, 57, sat on a couch in the back, looking a bit tearful. He said he was a Navy veteran and that he welcomed the decision. ""I served for the right to vote,"" he said. ""It's long overdue. We need representation."""
News,2018-01-04,"The small burgundy satchel bore the hallmarks of rugged craftsmanship: top-grain leather, double stitching on the straps. It was wider at the bottom, sort of like an inverted funnel, and two buckles secured the flap. Babak Behzadzadeh knew exactly how he might use the bag when he saw it hanging in a shop in Playa del Carmen, Mexico: It could be his bank.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/magazine/where-pot-entrepreneurs-go-when-the-banks-just-say-no.html,5984," The small burgundy satchel bore the hallmarks of rugged craftsmanship: top-grain leather, double stitching on the straps. It was wider at the bottom, sort of like an inverted funnel, and two buckles secured the flap. Babak Behzadzadeh knew exactly how he might use the bag when he saw it hanging in a shop in Playa del Carmen, Mexico: It could be his bank. Behzadzadeh owns two businesses in Denver. Avicenna Products makes potent marijuana concentrates. Next door, Green Sativa grows marijuana, which it sells directly through its own medical dispensary and store. By last spring, after just 18 months in operation, they were generating $250,000 to $350,000 in monthly sales, all of it in cash. During the workday, the satchel sat on a file cabinet in Behzadzadeh's small office at Avicenna, stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars that funded the two operations. One weekday afternoon last March, Avicenna's manager, Alex Elsberg, a bearish, bearded man with blue-tinted sunglasses perched on his crown, was prepared to drive a 100-mile circuit around Denver's north suburbs, where he would deliver concentrate to one dispensary, collect a payment from another and then, on his way back, visit a grower in Boulder to buy about 11 pounds of trim, the larger leaves that are stripped off the plants' flowers and are the raw material for concentrates. Behzadzadeh had agreed to pay $5,850 for the trim, and while Elsberg would collect at least that much in cash at his first two stops, he liked to separate the money coming in from the money going out. Elsberg walked into Behzadzadeh's office and over to the satchel, which is about the size of a small purse — Elsberg, who is 37, likes to call it Behzadzadeh's ""murse,"" for man purse — and removed six bundles of bills. He sat at the ornate wooden desk and on its inlaid-leather top began counting the bills in each thousand-dollar stack. Behzadzadeh, 50, was dressed in his customary uniform of brown leather vest and gray shirt, and he wore a silver Bluetooth headset like a necklace. As the men talked and laughed, a stack fell to the floor. ""One day, I brought in $6,000 from the safe from my store,"" Behzadzadeh reminisced. ""I put the money in the bag. The next day I was short a thousand dollars."" When the dispensary manager turned up nothing, Behzadzadeh grew alarmed. ""So Alex comes by to throw something in the garbage can, and there's a thousand dollars!"" They laughed heartily. ""If we had bank accounts,"" Behzadzadeh said, turning serious, ""it'd be much easier."" Growing and selling marijuana are, like using it, legal under Colorado law. But banks tend to take their cues from the federal government. Not only does selling marijuana violate federal law; handling the proceeds of any marijuana transaction is considered to be money laundering. Very few banks are willing to bear that risk. By the time Behzadzadeh took his Mexican beach vacation, he had already opened checking accounts for his businesses at Wells Fargo and Chase — and then saw them closed when the banks discovered what they were for. In most of the 22 states that, along with Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have legal marijuana markets, cash is not simply king; it is all-consuming. It is counted and recounted and stuffed into bulging envelopes, slid into back pockets and ferried around town in beaters and fully loaded S.U.V.s. Customers exchange it for marijuana at the counter; businesses use it to buy weed from wholesalers and for gardening supplies, plastic bottles and lab equipment. They use it for money orders at grocery stores. It pays employees and the rent and electric bills and taxes. It is fed into owners' personal bank accounts at A.T.M.s. On Jan. 1, California, which has permitted medical marijuana for decades, began allowing legal sales of recreational marijuana, creating a potential market many times the size of Colorado's, with the potential for many more banking headaches. But for Behzadzadeh, a solution lay in sight. In the fall of 2016, Elsberg and another employee, both veterans in the marijuana industry, put him in touch with Sundie Seefried, the chief executive of Partner Colorado, a credit union in Arvada, a Denver suburb. A division of the credit union, Safe Harbor Private Banking, provides checking accounts expressly for the marijuana industry, in clear violation of federal law. Partner Colorado was originally chartered in 1931 to serve postal workers; with about $350 million in assets, it still amounts to little more than a rounding error in the state's financial-services market. But in three years it has established itself, entirely through word of mouth, as the marijuana industry's biggest banker. These clients deposited $931 million in 2017. No other United States bank or credit union has probably taken as much, says Robert McVay, a Seattle-based lawyer who advises institutions on banking marijuana business. Most of those deposits are cash, taken off the streets and thereby reducing the latent, associated threat of robbery — a threat not just to those working in the industry but also to the ordinary people around them. As one banker put it to me, ""I don't want to stand in line next to a backpack filled with $30,000"" while someone fills out money orders. To manage these accounts, Seefried — working largely alone, in order to shield her colleagues from possible prosecution — created a sophisticated process to match deposits and withdrawals to marijuana transactions that are legal in the state. Seefried's bankers delve deeply into nearly every aspect of their clients' finances and operations. ""I said it in every interview in the beginning,"" Seefried told me. "" 'You have to understand: We're going to be the nosiest banker you ever had.' "" Five other small banks in the state also offer checking accounts to the industry and many more make occasional exceptions for companies owned by longtime customers, according to people who study and work in Colorado's marijuana industry. (They don't lend them money, though, because the federal authorities could seize whatever collateral backs a loan.) But it's difficult to say how many of these businesses have bank accounts in their own name, because most banks refuse to publicly discuss this line of business, and they require clients to sign agreements promising not to discuss the relationship. A similar situation exists in Washington State, where voters legalized buying and using recreational marijuana in 2012, when Colorado did. Seefried, by contrast, is happy to talk about it. ""Her openness to partner with me to teach stakeholders has been second to none,"" says Chris Myklebust, who oversaw Safe Harbor and every other financial institution chartered in Colorado as the state's banking-and-financial-services commissioner until he left the job in November. Seefried often accompanied Myklebust around the country to explain to state officials and bankers how marijuana banking works in Colorado. ""She understands the burden of being a financial institution serving the legal marijuana industry,"" he said. (She has also written a book, ""Navigating Safe Harbor,"" about it.) Seefried has managed to build a large and expanding portfolio of accounts that so far has withstood federal scrutiny. She hasn't been indicted, and she hasn't been told to stop. Seefried has concluded that, for the moment at least, her chances of facing prosecution are small — ""less than 20 percent,"" she says. Last spring, Behzadzadeh was gathering up dozens of business and financial records to send to her, and it was taking weeks. ""Sundie,"" he moaned one day after taking a call from his compliance officer, who was helping compile the paperwork. ""She wants my firstborn"" — and, he added, his left testicle. In the meantime, cash kept moving through the business. After returning from his rounds, Elsberg laid a pair of invoices on the table. Then he handed Behzadzadeh a No.10 envelope bulging with bills. Elsberg had already counted the money when he received it; now Behzadzadeh began counting it for himself, separating it into thousand-dollar stacks, before depositing them into the satchel. Then, having double-checked the totals, he entered each payment into his QuickBooks ledger and then into a Google spreadsheet that served as a cash log. The invoices are filed in case an inspector from the state's Marijuana Enforcement Division comes calling. Every dollar that comes into Behzadzadeh's companies is counted by Behzadzadeh or one of his employees at least three times before it goes out again. ""I've gotten to the routine where I need to put my own elastic bands around them,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""That way, I know I counted them."" Seefried imagined that these would be her golden years, time spent at her vacation house in Santa Fe painting desert flowers in the style of Georgia O'Keeffe. Seefried is just 56, but she was a credit-union veteran when she joined Partner Colorado in 1995; as its chief executive, she kept it profitable through the 2007 recession. In a stodgy industry, Seefried stands out, tall and even a little glamorous. In 2014, as her husband prepared to retire from another credit union, in Colorado Springs, she made plans to wind down her own career. Then one summer evening, while out for drinks, a group of lawyer friends confronted her with a question: Why couldn't their marijuana-industry clients get bank accounts? Seefried had in fact wondered about marijuana banking before. But, she said, ""nobody wanted to talk about it."" Now, buttonholed by her friends, she promised to investigate. She discovered that the conflict over marijuana — permitted by the state, prohibited by the United States — in Colorado and elsewhere has created a strange and uncertain legal landscape. ""It prevents either state law or federal law on marijuana from being effectively implemented,"" says John Walsh, who served as the United States attorney in Colorado from 2010 to 2016. Even Colorado officials who opposed legalizing marijuana — among them Gov. John Hickenlooper — support banking the proceeds, and not only because it reduces the prospect of robbery and violence. State laws carefully control, and heavily tax, marijuana distribution; regulators and law-enforcement officers investigating violators rely on the paper trails bank accounts leave behind. Banking, says Andrew Freedman, who for more than two years was the governor's director of marijuana coordination, ""is a really great redundant measure to make sure people are playing clean."" But that's not a view broadly shared by federal officials. Seefried says she was astonished last year when a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, speaking at a forum at the state Capitol, made the same slippery-slope argument against banking marijuana that is often made against smoking it: It would lead to banking cocaine, heroin and so on. Since Colorado's first medical-marijuana dispensaries opened their doors in 2009, the Department of Justice has seesawed between tolerating and prosecuting the nascent industry. National institutions like Wells Fargo, which had fished for clients at marijuana-industry conferences, were the first to abandon the field. Local banks followed, though a handful continued to serve some marijuana businesses discreetly. A game of cat and mouse ensued: Businesses would open an account under an innocuous-sounding name; after a few months of large cash deposits, the bank would investigate and close the account. When bankers noticed that currency from marijuana business reeked, enterprising owners began spraying it with Febreeze. In 2013, the Justice Department decided to focus on what it called ""the most-significant threats"" in marijuana trafficking. A memo from the deputy attorney general, James Cole, established eight priorities for federal law enforcement to investigate, such as a legal business as a front for other criminal activity, diverting marijuana to states where it remains illegal and selling marijuana to children. Yet around the same time, D.E.A. agents began showing up at bank offices in Colorado to remind executives that as far as the federal government was concerned, the whole industry remained illegal. The state bankers' association formally urged its members to avoid marijuana businesses. But to Seefried's great surprise, none of her state regulators did likewise. ""Everybody knew this money needed to be banked,"" she told me. ""They knew it."" In 2014, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network published guidance intending to clarify ""how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses."" To prevent money laundering, the Treasury Department, which protects the financial system from infiltration by illicit money, advised banks to know their customers. In this case, the government said, they had to satisfy themselves that clients weren't engaged in any of the prohibited activities in the Cole memo. And to comply with federal money-laundering law, they had to alert the department whenever money moved in and out of a marijuana business's account. The agency, in turn, makes those reports available to law enforcement. Most bankers did not take much comfort from the guidance, which could be retracted as easily as it was put forward, because read narrowly, it only explained how to report marijuana transactions to the government. It gave no assurance that banks would not face prosecution for money laundering. And not just money laundering: Partner Colorado's lawyer warned Seefried that the government could also charge her and the credit union's volunteer board with racketeering, a charge of criminal conspiracy that stiffens any penalties. ""All he kept saying to me during my research was, 'Sundie, there's no safe harbor.' "" The credit union's accountant advised her to read Piper Kerman's prison memoir, ""Orange Is the New Black."" Seefried, though, saw a way forward. Working off-hours at home with the blessing of Partner Colorado's board, she outlined the steps the credit union could take to demonstrate convincingly that marijuana-business clients were complying with the Cole memo. She named her vetting program Safe Harbor Private Banking. Forget the hippie colonies up in the mountains. The epicenter of Colorado marijuana production lies in Denver's north-side industrial district straddling I-70, where railroad spurs weave between warehouses, distribution centers and factories. Sharp-eyed visitors will quickly notice the signs of a cannabis facility: cameras over every entrance, hazmat signs and enormous HVAC systems. Avicenna and Green Sativa share a block with another licensed cultivation facility — a ""grow,"" in the crunchy slang that lingers from the underground days — and, according to Behzadzadeh's employees, possibly an unlicensed one, too. Avicenna is named for the Persian scholar who wrote ""The Canon of Medicine"" a thousand years ago. Behzadzadeh grew up in Iran, in a resolutely secular family; even as a boy, he couldn't stomach the fundamentalist clerics brought to power by the Iranian revolution. In 1983, when he was just 15, he left Iran by himself to join an older brother in the United States, arriving with almost no money. Behzadzadeh settled in Rhode Island, where he trained as a pharmacist. After seven years filling prescriptions, he found his way into software consulting and got rich before concluding that encroaching global consultancies would eventually swallow his business. At the time, Colorado was drafting the regulations governing the sale of recreational marijuana. ""I knew that this is a business of compliance before it's anything marijuana,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""I did not have a problem following the rules and regulations in pharmacy, so this would not be that difficult."" State and often local requirements govern every aspect of Colorado's marijuana trade to ensure safety and that no plant is grown or sold outside the licensed system, where it could evade taxation or end up in the hands of people not allowed to have it. Behzadzadeh led me to Avicenna's extraction room, where butane, under high pressure, is used to separate the psychoactive chemicals of cannabis from its leaves; Behzadzadeh, per Denver Fire Department regulations and at great expense, made the room blastproof. Next we stopped at the safe where he's obliged to store the drugs and any cash on hand at day's end. A few feet away, a young woman named Angel wielded a tool resembling a dental pick to pack small plastic vials with a sticky extract called wax, using a state-inspected scale, and a young man applied state-designed product labels onto state-mandated opaque plastic bottles. Other young men — apart from Angel, they were all men — supervised extracts baking in specialized ovens. In Behzadzadeh's office, we could watch all the activity in the building, including ourselves, watching all the activity, from 16 recorded camera feeds on a 50-inch monitor behind his desk. Another monitor over the couch displayed his dispensary 10 miles away in Federal Heights from four perspectives. But for all the regulatory rigor, the flux of cash requires adjustments on the fly that no business with a checkbook, let alone a line of credit, would have to face. That week, for example, Behzadzadeh hoped to parcel out his $22,000 payroll on Thursday. But the satchel was a little light. He had given a contractor $17,000 as a down payment on a new roof for his grow, which he was in the process of expanding. And a concentrates customer found itself short on cash, so Behzadzadeh agreed to split the product with the client and forgo a $7,000 payment. There was money in the safe at the dispensary, but nobody had time to go pick it up. So it was not until Friday morning that Elsberg walked into the office and pulled four thick envelopes from his jacket pocket containing $18,299.13: four days' worth of sales at the dispensary. Each envelope bore the day's total — the money had already been counted at the store, twice — but now Elsberg sat down at Behzadzadeh's big leather chair and pulled the cash out of an envelope. At one point, a loose note fluttered to the floor, blown by the ceiling fan. When Behzadzadeh finally sat down to disburse the payroll, it was after 5 p.m. He lugged a large vase full of change (the ""genie bottle"") over to the couch, retrieved from the satchel 22 thousand-dollar bundles, plus a big stack of small-denomination bills that he'd been collecting all week, and then laid it all on a cushion beside him. The first pay stub showed $932.81. Behzadzadeh took a thousand-dollar stack, peeled off a $100, which went into a new pile, and collected $32 from the small-bill stack. Then he reached into the genie bottle to retrieve the change, folded the stub and put it in an envelope with the cash. Walking out into the Friday twilight, very few of Behzadzadeh's employees probably gave much thought to the wad of cash in their pockets. But everyone in the business can recall one or another infamous crime — clerks forced to open a safe at gunpoint in a dispensary on East Colfax; the murder of a security guard in Aurora — and some spectacular heists have gone largely unreported, as when thieves broke through the roof of one grow and then cut open its safe. For these businesses, robbery poses an existential threat. The money is often gone — insurance to reimburse the loss is, naturally, expensive — replaced, potentially, by new costs for tighter security or tougher regulations or, in the case of a store, by damage to its veneer of safety. All of Behzadzadeh's cameras at Avicenna couldn't have protected his satchel from intruders with guns. ""It would only take one really effective rip-off gang,"" Walsh, the former U.S. attorney, says, ""to terrorize that industry."" Applying for a Safe Harbor checking account is an invasive procedure. The credit union first tries to learn as much as it can about the company and its owners, beginning with an hourlong interview, followed by the document collection that Behzadzadeh found so aggravating: lists of owners, investors, vendors and customers; financial statements and tax forms; the business's organizing documents; state licenses; leases, handbooks and more. The documents can multiply quickly, because marijuana businesses are often a web of affiliated companies with overlapping ownership. Each often gets its own bank account. Once the accounts are opened, Safe Harbor's bankers inspect the business and its premises as frequently as every three months, to confirm that it hews to all of Colorado's rules. Treasury's guidance implies that a bank can't properly make sure that a client stays on the right side of the Cole memo without a rigorous state licensing and regulatory plan in place, according to McVay, the Seattle lawyer. This, he says, explains why California's large medical-marijuana sector mostly lacks access to banking services: Local governments oversee the business, and with a very light touch. The state won't implement comprehensive regulations until later this year at the earliest. Safe Harbor bankers spend most of their time monitoring client transactions, tying every dollar the bank takes in to a legitimate sale and making sure that no dollar withdrawn disappears into the illicit economy. Each month, they reconcile the account activity to a company's ledger and the sales it reports, as well as to all the other information they've gleaned about a client, such as which companies it normally trades with. The credit union has compiled reams of data about how money moves around the marijuana industry, and bankers regularly compare notes about the transactions they see. When an unusual deposit arrives — larger than typical, say, or from a new source — the banker holds the money until the client can account for it. Seefried recalls how a banker noticed that one dispensary seemed to have customers with unusually deep pockets: its sales averaged $300 to $400 each, while medical-marijuana patients generally spend less than $100 at dispensaries. The banker interrogated the client and, from the parking lot, even staked out the dispensary and studied its customers. In the end, still mystified by how the dispensary made its money, Safe Harbor closed the account. ""You cannot bank what you don't understand,"" Seefried says. Safe Harbor has closed three other accounts after members broke various credit-union rules, indicating that they weren't willing to be fully transparent with their bankers. Late last summer, Seefried ejected three more members after bankers, working with money-laundering experts, detected suspicious activity. And another three closed their accounts rather than comply with her increasingly strict requirements, including one that customers deposit 90 percent of their receipts. The rule, she acknowledges, was mainly intended to weed out less-committed clients: Only a business trying to hide its transactions would be put off by it. Last June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado's federal regulator, conducted its annual examination of the credit union's books and practices, and for the third year in a row, had no complaints about Safe Harbor. Today the program consists of 13 people, including five responsible solely for compliance. Most are women. (Women manage more than half of all credit unions.) When Seefried hires bankers for Partner Colorado, she gravitates toward sociable people. For Safe Harbor, she says she prefers introverts or, at the very least, people who evince precision and curiosity. This sort of meticulous banking isn't cheap. For each $100,000 deposited at Safe Harbor, a client pays $450 in fees in the first year and $300 thereafter. (Client companies that serve the marijuana industry but don't actually sell the drugs, like laboratories, require much less vetting and so pay much lower fees.) Seefried says the Safe Harbor program made a modest profit in its first year — less than $200,000. It became much more lucrative for the credit union in 2016, but Seefried won't reveal specifics. According to federal data, most of the institution's sources of income have stayed relatively steady since 2014, but fee income has grown to a projected $5 million in 2017 from nearly $3 million. Seefried says that about three-quarters of Safe Harbor's marijuana-selling clients pay less than $1,000 a month per account, considerably less than they would pay at banks, where monthly account fees are said to start at $1,500. Many observers assume that the opportunity to assess lucrative fees is what entices small banks to take on these risky accounts. Federal data show that at Champion Bank, in suburban Denver, which began explicitly working with marijuana businesses in 2014, annual fee revenue on deposit accounts increased by a factor of 68 from 2013 to 2016, to $752,000 from $11,000, even as its main line of business, providing loans, shrank. At Colorado Bank and Trust in La Junta, fees grew elevenfold to $2.9 million. For marijuana businesses, engaging with the financial mainstream has kept them mostly free from legal trouble. Safe Harbor has received subpoenas for the bank records of only four of the just over 200 clients it has had. None has yet been indicted. John Walsh can recall prosecuting one case against regulated dispensaries and none against a business serving the industry. But working without a checking account makes even an otherwise law-abiding business look evasive, says Lewis Koski, who served as the first director of the state's Marijuana Enforcement Division, which collects marijuana taxes and regulates the industry, before he joined Andrew Freedman in a consulting venture. A cash-management technique like personal deposits structured to evade notice can legally amount to money laundering. ""Banking,"" Koski says, ""just provides a really clear picture of where money is coming in and where money is going out."" On the last Wednesday of last March, Kim Oliver, Partner Colorado's executive vice president, pulled her old, mud-streaked silver Jetta into Avicenna's parking lot. She had come from her ranch, east of Denver. She was dressed formally and seemed intently focused on the business at hand. Seefried had reviewed all of Behzadzadeh's paperwork; now only an inspection stood between him and a bank account. Behzadzadeh gave Oliver a warm welcome, and Elsberg took her ID, signed her in and gave her a visitor badge. Oliver made a mental note: the first small compliance test, passed. Oliver, who is 59, has worked in credit unions all her adult life. Earlier she had confided to me a lifelong hostility to marijuana and rage when she discovered that her son-in-law, a veteran suffering from PTSD and living in her house, was cultivating a small crop in her basement. But working on Safe Harbor had forced her to reconsider her views on medical marijuana. ""I found out that he wasn't blowing smoke,"" she told me. (I couldn't tell if she intended the pun.) ""That was my whole thing: You're just trying to have an excuse to smoke dope."" She now supplies her arthritic mother with topical creams that contain cannabidiol, a chemical compound in the marijuana flower that doesn't produce a high but that medical-marijuana advocates believe reduces inflammation. Oliver sat down with Behzadzadeh and Elsberg at a gray marble table in the kitchenette just inside the employee entrance. She began the formal inspection by going through a checklist: six pages long, scores of questions. The first series delved into Behzadzadeh's financial practices and the second into business procedures. These were meant to assess Behzadzadeh's compliance with state regulations. Then she read five or six questions about each of the eight Cole memo priorities. After a response, Oliver made a check — almost always ""yes"" — and sometimes wrote a little note beside it. ""If you had an employee, and they cut a bud off,"" she asked at one point, ""how would you catch who did that?"" ""Cut a bud off"" — the phrase in Oliver's Great Plains twang was disorienting. One of the incongruities in Colorado's marijuana business is how professionals new to the trade adopt the Mendocino idiom without either irony or any particular reverence, the way their clothes absorb the plant's scent after a few hours on site. The industry's brand-builders prefer more sanitized language when talking to the public: ""adult use"" for ""recreational"" and ""cannabis"" for ""marijuana."" Elsberg replied, ""That's the beauty of it — we have cameras on everything."" The questions, and especially the answers, occasionally delved into minutiae, as when Behzadzadeh noted that he had hired a man to drive the perimeter of his two buildings hourly every night. Oliver raised an eyebrow. ""He's legal,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""I checked his sosh"" — Social Security number. ""I checked his driver's license."" He deadpanned, ""I sent a copy to Jeff Sessions, too."" Next, Oliver went about documenting compliance, snapping photos of the cameras, the safes, the locks on cabinets and other equipment, the bars blocking the windows and even the eyewash station. She walked over to a bakery-bun rack and photographed the RFID tag lying next to a brittle sheet of an extract known as shatter. Then she had an employee type the tag number into the state record system to call up that batch's history. She visited the grow next door (""I'm surprised they have as many cameras that they do,"" she remarked approvingly afterward) and then followed Behzadzadeh and Elsberg up to the dispensary in Federal Heights. The dispensary inspection got off to a rocky start when Oliver noticed the A.T.M. near the entrance. Cash-machine companies often rent them to dispensaries and stores, because so few can accept credit cards, but Behzadzadeh owned his and each week filled it with $2,000 in cash taken from the register. ""That's got to change,"" Oliver said matter-of-factly. ""The biggest way of laundering money is through the A.T.M."" Behzadzadeh's machine was tied to a personal bank account; every time a customer withdrew cash, that account received a credit. But the register money was unaccounted for; it could come from anywhere. Now, Oliver told him, he would have to withdraw money from Safe Harbor and hire an armored car to deliver the cash and fill the A.T.M.; he couldn't even touch it himself. A look of incredulity crossed Behzadzadeh's face. ""Wait — I'm not going to give my business to somebody else!"" he said. As a start-up entrepreneur, Behzadzadeh nursed a swelling grudge against the contractors and vendors who nickeled and dimed him, he thought, at every turn — maybe even Safe Harbor. The cost of banking was one thing, but the prospect of trading the satchel for an armored car from a company like Blue Line, another niche player that charged a premium in a niche industry, especially galled him. ""I have no problem doing business with you guys, and I appreciate the banking, but I'm not going to pay Blue Line to take my money,"" he said, his voice rising. ""There's no way."" Oliver kept pressing. ""All they're doing is loading the machine for you,"" she said. ""If I wanted to be on the black market, I would come in here and fill this machine all the time to clean the money."" ""Ah,"" Behzadzadeh said. Now he understood. He thought out loud: He would bring cash from Avicenna to the dispensary and give it to a courier, who would put different cash, which he had brought with him, into the A.T.M. ""While you're doing that"" — Behzadzadeh addressed the imaginary courier — ""I'll make you coffee."" Behzadzadeh's dogs were barking ferociously when he and his wife returned home from dinner late one night in September. They didn't think anything of it, but several hours later, the couple heard noises in their house. Behzadzadeh gathered his wife and children in a bedroom and raced downstairs with a laser-sighted pistol. But the intruders were gone, along with his cellphone — and the satchel. The robbery could have been a financial disaster. A month earlier, the Denver Fire Department had determined that the extraction room at Avicenna was not sufficiently blastproof, shutting down the factory for two months. ""If they had taken $30,000 or $40,000,"" Behzadzadeh said, ""it would have literally broken my back."" But the satchel held no money that night. Behzadzadeh had opened his bank accounts the morning after the inspection. It had taken him a few months to fully embrace them — Seefried had predicted as much — but now around two-thirds of his trading partners also accept or write checks. What cash remains in Behzadzadeh's business waits in safes, secured to the floor, for the armored truck. Yet despite Safe Harbor's efforts and those of its competitors, bank accounts remain out of reach for many Colorado marijuana companies. The high fees put off smaller businesses at the same time as banks seem to be pulling back. Seefried didn't want Safe Harbor deposits to swamp the credit union, so last January she reduced the number of new monthly clients from five to three and then closed the door altogether in August after deposits ballooned over the summer. As the state Marijuana Enforcement Division granted licenses to about 220 additional companies last year through November, Safe Harbor's waiting list swelled to 96 businesses, or two-and-a-half-years' worth of new clients, before the credit union stopped adding names to it. The five banks have become very stingy about granting new accounts, according to three C.P.A.s who have marijuana-industry clients. The parent company of one of those institutions, Colorado National Bank, declared bankruptcy in November, putting its future as a marijuana banker in doubt. Marijuana banking has always depended entirely on forbearance from Washington, and the Trump administration seems decidedly less tolerant than its predecessor. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions declared before a gathering of law-enforcement officials that marijuana is ""only slightly less awful"" than heroin. ""I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store,"" he said. A task force assembled in February by the Justice Department to combat violent crime didn't recommend any changes to the Cole memo when it delivered its initial findings last summer, but the agency is very likely revising it. (The Justice Department wouldn't comment on its deliberations.) [Update: After this article went to press, the Justice Department rescinded the Cole memo, giving U.S. attorneys more latitude to enforce federal marijuana laws in their districts.] Seefried had hoped to begin making loans to and processing credit-card transactions for Safe Harbor's existing clients, but for the foreseeable future, she has put those plans on hold. Until federal law catches up to public sentiment, marijuana banking is unlikely to keep pace with the industry — the vetting is too expensive. Just last month, after a client was caught up in a police investigation, Safe Harbor had to review the account to make sure bankers hadn't missed any suspicious activity. ""It cost me $30,000: $20,000 to bring in investigators for three days and $10,000 for legal fees,"" Seefried told me. ""That's one client, with one problem."" She plans to raise fees in the next couple months. Yet she still hopes to position Safe Harbor as a model for banking the marijuana industry elsewhere. In November, Safe Harbor began licensing its name and protocols to financial institutions nationwide. Six banks and credit unions in six states will begin taking on customers this month, including a credit union in Colorado to serve the customers that Safe Harbor no longer can. Three more will join each quarter. Safe Harbor is also testing a mobile-phone app for buying marijuana in Hawaii's handful of state-licensed dispensaries. In June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado's regulator, advised Seefried that it would begin examining the institution quarterly rather than yearly, which she attributes to the national expansion. She has hired two full-time employees just to manage the increased compliance. ""We are bringing more credit unions to the table, and they don't want us teaching them incorrectly,"" she says. One industry investment facilitator, the Arcview Group, estimates that legal marijuana sales in the United States will more than double to roughly $21 billion by 2021 from nearly $9 billion last year. Walsh, the former prosecutor, has concluded that the tension between the federal government and liberalizing states is unsustainable. ""I came in as U.S. attorney in 2010 assuming that it was my job to enforce the federal marijuana laws regardless of what state legalization efforts would look like,"" he says. ""The longer I worked on the issue, and we struggled with it, the more I realized that a simple shut-it-down approach was not practical. The notion that you can put this genie back in the bottle today is not realistic."""

It probably isn't; kale's triumph in the United States is exceptional. In a recent article for the online magazine Taste, the writer Mari Uyehara traced kale's kaleidoscopic success — from relative obscurity as an Italian cooking green to chain-restaurant salads to the diets of millions of Americans — back to the fall of 2007. That's when Joshua McFadden was working as the chef de cuisine at Franny's, a pizzeria in Brooklyn, and improvised a new dish using the raw dark leaves of lacinato kale. The vegetable, with roots in the Mediterranean, was typically cooked to break down its network of tough fibers, and it was still fairly unusual, though not entirely unheard-of, to serve it raw. McFadden rolled the kale tightly to make a chiffonade, cutting it into thin, delicate strips measuring 1/16 of an inch wide, and marinated these with garlic, olive oil, lemon juice and cheese. It was a low-key dish on a low-key day, but it became a part of American restaurant mythology all the same, because it wasn't long afterward that the kale salad ascended to fame and kale, once an esoteric green, went mainstream. In his cookbook ""Six Seasons: A New Way With Vegetables,"" published last May, McFadden includes a recipe for the dish and calls it ""The Kale Salad That Started It All."" I'd had the salad, and in the following years I had my fill of its rough, endlessly chewy imitations — too often made with thick, ancient leaves. It had the effect of putting me off kale altogether, especially when it was served raw. When I spent a few weekends last year cooking from McFadden's book, propelled from one recipe to the next, I was careful not to brush up against a single bunch of the stuff. This was easy. I made the fava beans on toast. The celery dressed with minced anchovies and raisins. The buttery walnut crostata filled with chard and ricotta. His instructions were loose but sharp-eyed, with constant reminders that a wide range of possibilities exists for every vegetable. Celery, for example, could be dressed raw, or it could be braised with olive oil and white wine, or it could be simmered with vegetable stock and blended into an unexpectedly luxurious soup. Every vegetable could shine, not in the limited ways you expected them to, but in many ways. As winter started to creep in, later than usual, and hardy greens took over the market stands in Brooklyn, I turned increasingly to McFadden's suggestions for what to do with collard greens (stew them with beans and chiles and an old, dried-out rind of cheese). And kale. I'd nearly forgotten that kale wasn't only a hyperbolic pitch or a lazy headline; that it was a reliable, cheap green that made for good eating, especially when it was cooked — until I followed McFadden's recipe for a kale-centric pasta sauce. I was drawn in by the simple technique: You pull lacinato kale leaves from their pale, woody ribs and blanch the greens in salted boiling water, just until they are tender. Then you whir the dripping-wet kale in a blender with some garlic and the olive oil that the garlic was fried in and season it all with salt and pepper. The kale, puréed this way, turned a vivid green — a sunny almost neon green. It appeared glossy and completely smooth, and it tasted sweet and mellow. Tossed with pasta, grated Parmigiano and a little extra pasta water, it loosened up, becoming very nearly creamy. And it was done in the same amount of time it would take to make a salad. ""It's a very simple way to convey new olive oil and a winter green,"" McFadden told me on the phone. ""It's an unexpected flavor in the dead of winter."" McFadden left New York years ago and opened Ava Gene's, his own restaurant, in Portland, Ore. He devoted himself to the growing and cooking of so many other vegetables, but still, somehow, reporters were calling him and asking about kale. I wondered if he was tired of talking about it. ""Sure,"" he said gently. ""Wouldn't you be?"" I saw his point. And I asked if he used other varieties of winter greens to make the same sauce, thinking that this way I might write about something else. But his answer was firm. ""I would never make this with anything else,"" he said. ""It wouldn't make sense."" Recipe: Kale-Sauce Pasta"
News,2018-01-04,"MOSCOW — As usual, a Winnie the Pooh doll sat rinkside to reassure Japan’s Yuzuru Hanyu, the reigning men’s Olympic figure skating champion and perhaps the greatest skater of any era.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/sports/olympics/yuzuru-hanyu.html,2895," MOSCOW — As usual, a Winnie the Pooh doll sat rinkside to reassure Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu, the reigning men's Olympic figure skating champion and perhaps the greatest skater of any era. Pooh gave smiling, uncritical approval of Hanyu, 23, in late October at an important pre-Olympic competition in Moscow called the Rostelecom Cup. Hanyu prefaced each routine with a quirky ritual, squeezing Pooh for good luck before he stepped onto the ice. He chose the Disney character as his personal mascot, according to a fan blog, because he found comfort in Pooh's unchanging gaze. Sometimes Hanyu bowed to the Pooh doll, which doubled as a tissue dispenser. Other times, he shook Pooh's paw and patted his head. Several thousand of Hanyu's fans had traveled from Japan, China, South Korea and the United States to see him compete. Some wore fuzzy Pooh ears. Others wore Pooh hats and costumes with cape-like attachments resembling Pooh's red shirt. Good luck totems can carry a skater only so far, though. This is a story about obsession — the preoccupation that Hanyu's fans have with a transcendent international star and his own ambition for impeccable victory. Two and a half weeks after the Moscow competition, Hanyu's fixation with difficult jumps led to an ankle injury. Ligament, tendon and bone damage to his right ankle kept him off the ice for more than a month, just as he was supposed to enter his final preparation for the 2018 Winter Games in February in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Hanyu was named to Japan's Olympic team in late December. Officials said they hoped he could recover. But the Winter Games were only weeks away and Hanyu's ankle remained unstable. He could not yet practice his jumps. Until he can complete a triumphant routine, uncertainty will shroud Hanyu's availability and reliability for the Olympics, creating agita not only for his fans but at the highest levels of his sport. At the least, the injury has threatened to jeopardize Hanyu's chance of becoming the first repeat men's champion since Dick Button of the United States in 1948 and 1952. On a larger scale, Hanyu would be one of the Games' few inimitable figures, hailing from a country that vibrantly supports the fading sport of figure skating. His absence, or his inability to compete at his best, would dim the star power at a global event where ticket sales and interest have lagged. And Olympic marketing experts could miss a huge opportunity to cultivate the Asian market for the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing. Even if Hanyu can participate, the Winter Games will be his first competition in three months. And he won't have Pooh to comfort him inside the rink. The presence of Pooh's likeness would contravene Olympic rules of sponsorship and branding. When healthy, his ambitious athleticism allows him to perform remarkable four-revolution jumps known as quads. And the emotion and interpretive skills of his artistry and musicality have made him a figure of fascination. He covers the ice with the creativity of a brush stroke and the precision of a stylus. ""He's the most complete athlete in figure skating, probably ever,"" said Stephane Lambiel of Switzerland, the 2006 Olympic silver medalist who is now a coach. Hanyu can appear delicate, a boyish Christopher Robin with his Pooh. He also blurs rigid gender lines with his performances, possessing a grace and elegance that fans and journalists say are prized in Japan over a hypermasculine style of skating. It is his aim, he says, ""to stir something in people's hearts."" And, too, Hanyu is a relentless competitor who persevered after a devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami struck northeast Japan and rattled his hometown, Sendai. He rotates so fast and tightly on his jumps that his body seems to disappear on its thin axis. ""He's got this aura, this special presence that only he has,"" said Midori Ito, who in 1992 became the first Japanese skater to win an Olympic medal, taking second place in the women's competition at the Winter Games in Albertville, France. Even Hanyu's physique — slender body, long neck, arms and legs — is atypical for a Japanese skater, said Ito, who is now a skating analyst. ""He's so fierce on the ice, but in the kiss and cry he's got his Pooh,"" Ito said through an interpreter, referring to the area just off the ice where skaters wait to learn their scores after a routine. ""That gap is what makes him attractive."" Hanyu is the first Japanese man to win an Olympic gold medal in figure skating. As such, he is among the country's most popular athletes and endorses products from mattresses to chewing gum to a video game to an airline. His routines bear the appealing, tense contrast between art and athleticism at the heart of figure skating. Sometimes, this puts Hanyu in conflict with himself. He is an unsurpassed virtuoso, but he is also an athlete who wants to jump as proficiently as any other skater, even if that elevates the risk of injury — perhaps unnecessarily. Hanyu's expected rival for a 2018 gold medal, Nathan Chen of the United States, has become the first skater to complete five quads in a single routine. Hanyu wanted to keep pace as a jumper, even if he might get hurt. He seemed to view skating the way Brazilians are said to view soccer. It was better to perform aspiringly and attractively and lose than to perform conservatively and win. ""I am an athlete, and as an athlete it's normal to keep challenging to do more and more,"" Hanyu has said. He fell twice during his free skate at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia. He said he wanted to deliver an unblemished, more inspired performance at the 2018 Winter Games. ""Could he win without the big, giant tricks? Yes,"" said Hanyu's coach, Brian Orser, who won two Olympic silver medals competing for Canada in the 1980s. ""But that's not him. He's willing to take the risk. He's visualizing a greater win than last time. It wasn't that magical moment you usually see at the Olympics."" While the popularity of figure skating has nose-dived in the United States for several reasons, including the lack of a women's star and the indifference of younger fans, the sport thrives in Japan, especially among women. Over the past quarter-century, Japan's singles skaters have enjoyed regular international success that has been both engaging in its artistry and groundbreaking in its athleticism. Japanese fans flock to international competitions, buying tickets by lottery, often finding it easier to obtain seats outside of Japan than inside. At a tiny rink in Barrie, Ontario, Hanyu's fans have even camped out overnight to be first in line when the doors opened. And Japan's television networks and corporate sponsors are vital to bankrolling the International Skating Union. ""It's keeping the sport alive,"" said Jason Dungjen, a former American national pairs champion who coaches Japanese skaters. Five Japanese television networks covered Hanyu's performance at the Rostelecom Cup in Moscow. So did several dozen print journalists and photographers who recorded his every jump, spin and utterance. Last spring, the skating website icenetwork.com found Hanyu on the cover of 19 publications called mooks — a combination of magazine and book — at a Japanese bookstore. The bookstore was not in Tokyo. It was in Midtown Manhattan. ""It reminds me of when Michael Jackson was in his heyday, or meeting the Pope,"" said Jackie Wong, a prominent skating blogger and former skater who lives in New York. ""People see Hanyu for the first time and they become hysterical or they're moved to tears. It's like their lives are complete. It's crazy."" As Hanyu was introduced in Moscow for the short program at the Rostelecom Cup, Japanese fans waved small national flags. On one side of the rink alone, there were 16 banners proclaiming ""Go Yuzu"" and other exhortations. As Hanyu began to perform to Chopin, the crowd grew so quiet that the scrape of his blades could be heard in the upper reaches of Megasport Arena. A month earlier, Hanyu had set a world record for points for a short program. But in Moscow, he landed clumsily on a quadruple loop and put his hands to the ice after an awkward combination jump. The judges placed him second to Chen. Still, Hanyu's appreciative fans showered the ice with dozens of Pooh dolls. ""Did you see the Poohs?"" Yoshiko Kobayashi, the high-performance director of the Japanese Skating Federation, later asked an American reporter. ""The ice turned yellow."" After a news conference with international reporters, Hanyu was engulfed on a dais by Japanese reporters and photographers. Kobayashi pulled a stopwatch from her purse. ""I control,"" she said. The Japanese reporters would have five minutes, she said. She gave them almost seven, then freed Hanyu from the scrum. The next day, Hanyu's fans again gathered to watch his free skate. Among them was Saori Kanayama, 30, a Japanese flight attendant who had traveled from Dubai for the competition. She had planned her vacation to attend the Olympics. All she needed was a ticket. Hanyu's fans wrote thousands of letters to him, made dolls in his likeness and sent him origami, cookies and towels to wipe his face after training. Kanayama brought rock music CDs with her. ""He has too many Poohs,"" she said. Her reasons for following Hanyu's career so closely were partly cultural. ""Japanese people are shy, we are not supposed to show our honest feelings,"" she said. ""As a skater, Yuzuru doesn't hesitate to show how much he wants to be No. 1."" Wearing a white tunic and skating as a character out of Japanese folklore, Abe no Seimei, a kind of soothsayer and supernatural protector, Hanyu landed a quadruple lutz for the first time in competition. It is the most difficult of the four-revolution jumps currently being performed, requiring the jab of a toe pick, a liftoff from the back outside edge of one skate and a landing on the back outside edge of the other skate. But the performance was not flawless. Hanyu finished second over all to Chen. Some of his fans cried in the stands, including one wearing a costume identical to Hanyu's. Frank Carroll, a renowned American coach who guided Evan Lysacek to a 2010 Olympic gold medal, attended the Rostelecom Cup. In his view, Hanyu seemed diminished. ""I don't see what he had a few years ago,"" Carroll said. ""I'm sorry. I know he does some beautiful things, but I don't see the inspiration."" At a news conference, Hanyu complimented Chen as ""a wonderfully talented person who does great jumps with a balletic expression."" ""I need to practice more and more,"" Hanyu said. The next evening, Hanyu's supporters were newly ebullient in filling the lobby of Moscow's Aerostar Hotel, where the skaters were feted at a banquet. The fans formed two lines through which skaters walked, some stopping briefly for photos and autographs. A kind of spirit seemed to overtake Hanyu when he skated, lending him endearing masculine and feminine qualities, said one fan, Junko Ino, 36, a teacher from Fukuoka, Japan. ""He's powerful and tender,"" Ino said. ""His emotion will heal your heart."" Sayuri Arimoto, 50, a software engineer, had traveled from San Mateo, Calif., to see Hanyu, even if it left her co-workers puzzled. ""You travel to Europe just for figure skating?"" they asked her. When Hanyu was home in Japan, he sometimes skated at midnight for peace and quiet, his coach said. And in Toronto, where he trained most of the time, he occasionally called his coach to ask for a ride, uncomfortable with some fans who knew his daily routine and waited to ride the bus with him. At the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club, Hanyu's team makes a great effort to answer his fan mail and to keep fans, bloggers and other journalists from intruding to videotape his practices. ""You can have a bad day and nobody's going to be writing about it,"" said Orser, Hanyu's coach. When he did not receive a desired result, Hanyu said, he felt a need to apologize to his fans, but did not consider the expectations of his supporters and the news media to be a burden. ""Honestly,"" he said through an interpreter, ""sometimes I'm feeling like they treat me as a celebrity or an idol, but I'm not quite that. But I understand they're all here to support me and I appreciate that passion."" In the lobby of the Aerostar Hotel, Hanyu emerged through a side door, wearing a black suit for the banquet. He almost reached the elevators before fans noticed him. They hurried to take photos and videos. Among them was Hiroko Sato, 49, a neighbor of Hanyu's in Sendai, Japan. Her family's construction company had sustained damage during the 2011 earthquake. Hanyu was training at the Sendai rink and, terrified, ran outside in his skates when the ice began to rumble. He and his parents and his sister were left without electricity or drinking water. They spent three days at an emergency shelter at a gymnasium. The rink closed for several months, leaving him a skating vagabond. Upon winning a gold medal at the 2014 Olympics, Hanyu, then 19, worried aloud that his victory would be a frivolous gesture to those who had suffered in Sendai. That was not true, said Sato, his neighbor. Hanyu skated in a benefit for victims of the earthquake and donated royalties from his two autobiographies to the rink in Sendai. Hanyu had called her after the earthquake, she said, asking, ""Are you O.K.?"" and telling her, ""Hang in there."" ""He gave hope for us,"" Sato said. She teared up as she recounted the destruction of the earthquake. ""He got the gold medal at the Olympics."" The second week of November, Hanyu was set to compete in his second major pre-Olympic event of the season, the NHK Trophy in Osaka, Japan. Orser, his coach, had described Hanyu as being ""so focused, so driven"" that he was ""on the verge of manic"" in his determination to win a second Olympic gold medal. Orser tried to convince Hanyu that there should be a natural ebb and flow to a long skating season. Button, the 1948 and 1952 Olympic champion, cautioned Hanyu not to overtrain. And one of Hanyu's idols, Evgeni Plushenko of Russia, the 2006 Olympic champion, suggested that Hanyu would not need five quadruple jumps in his Olympic free skate as Chen of the United States aspired to. Shoma Uno, a Japanese teenager who finished second to Hanyu at the 2017 world championships, was also a magnificent jumper. But Hanyu had a decided edge over other skaters in the completeness of his performance — spins, skating skills, transitions between jumps and musical interpretation, Plushenko said. ""If he has three quads and skates clean, he can win the Olympics one more time,"" Plushenko said. ""If he does all the things he can, he's going to win easily."" The biggest hurdle to his own failed attempt to repeat as Olympic champion, Plushenko said, was injury: ""In my head I was ready to skate but my body is sometimes going, 'No, wait, please, please.'"" His words were prescient. On Nov. 9, a day before the NHK Trophy began, Hanyu attempted a quadruple lutz in practice, but his legs landed in a pretzled position. More than 100 Japanese journalists turned up at a news conference that evening to learn of Hanyu's condition. The next day, it was announced that he had ligament damage in his right ankle but would try to compete. Instead, he withdrew. (Weeks later, it would be revealed that the ankle had also sustained tendon and bone damage.) ""I am very sorry to have everyone worried,"" Hanyu said in a statement. At Osaka's Municipal Central Gymnasium, where the NHK Trophy went on without Hanyu, his fans were left dejected. Zeng Yuemeng, 28, an Osaka airport worker, said she had moved to Japan from China in July because of her favorite skater. She carried a Pooh keychain on her purse. ""Because this is his country,"" Zeng said of Hanyu, ""maybe I can see why he has become such a perfect human."" Other fans took a half-hour train ride to pray for Hanyu at a Shinto shrine in Kobe, Japan. Because the shrine's name — Yuzuruha — resembled the first name of the skater, it had become a popular place for fans to write their well-wishes to Hanyu on round wooden plaques. Hundreds of plaques hung on racks at the shrine. Visitors who came to pray washed their hands at a stone basin, rang bells attached to thick ropes, bowed and clapped their hands. Ann Liu, 18, a Chinese student studying in Tokyo, carried a Pooh purse and said that Hanyu often buoyed her in difficult moments. She was trying to do the same for him. ""He's my guiding light,"" Liu said. Lai Aishan, 38, who worked in a university computer center in Taiwan, said she had struggled to sleep after learning of Hanyu's injury. She had tickets for the NHK Trophy but felt too disconsolate to watch skating on this Saturday afternoon. Buying a plaque in the fading light, Lai affixed a drawing she had made of Hanyu in gold ink. ""I feel a little better now,"" she said."

Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/briefing/weather-stephen-bannon-intel.html,1239,"  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: • Icy winds and heavy snow are expected today in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast as a powerful winter storm that delivered rare snowfall to Florida heads north. Our live briefing has the latest. The storm is being called a ""bomb cyclone"" for its sudden drop in atmospheric pressure (our video explains). Flights have been canceled, and schools have been closed up and down the East Coast. • The bitterly cold weather has heating-oil providers working overtime. Power generators are switching from natural gas to coal and petroleum to meet demand. • President Trump has broken sharply with Stephen Bannon, his onetime chief strategist, after Mr. Bannon was quoted in a new book disparaging the president's children and accusing Donald Trump Jr. of treason. ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,"" Mr. Trump said in a written statement. ""When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind."" Read the rest here. Our White House correspondents note: ""Assuming it lasts — and with Mr. Trump, nothing is ever certain — the schism could test whether he or Mr. Bannon has more resonance with the conservative base that has sustained the president through a tumultuous tenure marked by low poll numbers."" • Separately, Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday to try to limit the scope of the special counsel's Russia investigation. • President Trump abruptly dissolved a White House commission he had charged with investigating voter fraud after he claimed, without evidence, that widespread irregularities had cost him the popular vote. He cast the decision as a result of continuing legal challenges, but added that the Department of Homeland Security would continue the investigative work. • No state has uncovered significant evidence of fraud, and election officials, including many Republicans, have strongly rejected Mr. Trump's claim. • The security problems, called Meltdown and Spectre, could allow hackers to steal data from mobile devices, personal computers and servers running in so-called cloud computer networks. Meltdown affects nearly all microprocessors made by Intel, whose chips are used in more than 90 percent of the servers underpinning the internet. Spectre affects most processors but is more difficult to exploit, researchers say. • The advice for computer users is longstanding: Update your software. • This week's overture between South Korea and the North is viewed — from the sidelines — with deep suspicion in Washington. Trump administration officials said on Wednesday that talks should be limited to North Korea's participation in the Winter Olympics, which will be held in South Korea next month. • Diplomats say  it is important for Seoul to be in lock step with Washington. ""It is fine for the South Koreans to take the lead,"" said a former adviser in the Obama administration. ""But if they don't have the U.S. behind them, they won't get far with North Korea."" • The Justice Department is rescinding an Obama-era policy discouraging federal prosecution of marijuana-related charges. The move, just after California became the sixth state to allow recreational use of pot, could undermine the legalization movement. • It was not immediately clear whether the administration would crack down on dispensaries, or if it is merely rattling its saber. • The party's over at the car lot.  U.S. auto sales fell 1.8 percent in 2017, ending seven years of growth. Tesla announced that production of its new electric vehicle, the Model 3, was far behind schedule. • Russia and Venezuela are developing their own virtual currencies, hoping to sidestep U.S. sanctions. • Spotify, the streaming music giant, plans to go public. • U.S. stocks were up on Wednesday. Here's a snapshot of global markets today. Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • It's never too early to encourage children to be givers, not takers. • If you're sick, try to stay away from the office. If you can't, here's what to do. • Recipe of the day: For a lasagna night, use broccoli rabe instead of meat. • A city of addict entrepreneurs The drug crisis has turned countless recovered addicts into businesspeople: They get clean, open their own clinics, and sometimes take over the neighborhood. It's the third part of our series on the industry of addiction treatment. • Virginia's tiebreaker drawing is back on The name of the winner in a cliffhanger of a state House race is to be plucked from a bowl in Richmond today. But it might not be the last word. • Want to be happy? Think like an old person. So says one of our reporters, who spent years following the lives of six New Yorkers over 85. Here's what he learned. • In memoriam Fred Bass transformed his father's small used-book store, the Strand, into a Manhattan emporium with the slogan ""18 Miles of Books."" He was 89. • Best of late-night TV The comedy hosts were intrigued after President Trump said he would announce awards for ""dishonest"" and ""corrupt"" members of the media. • Quotation of the day ""Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn't as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country."" — President Trump, responding to Stephen Bannon calling Mr. Trump's eldest son ""treasonous."" A new year can bring many changes, but 1999 saw what The Times's Op-Ed page called the ""most audacious gamble in the history of currency"": the introduction of the euro. Almost 40 years in the works, the euro was toasted with Champagne by finance ministers in the 11 countries where it was introduced. Though euro bank notes and coins wouldn't be released until 2002, eurozone banks were required to use the currency in transactions as soon as markets opened on Jan. 4, 1999. Fears of technical glitches meant banks brought in employees en masse: In Frankfurt, one bank had 3,200 people working to reprogram its computers. London had 30,000 workers on trading floors and in back offices, even though Britain wasn't even adopting the euro. The switch took more than a year of planning, months of rewriting software, and full-scale dress rehearsals. But the reward for the banking world's tireless efforts was a smooth debut when world markets opened for business. Others received something more concrete: For sharing a birthday with the new currency, each baby born in France on New Year's Day that year received 100 euros from the Finance Ministry.

Op-Ed,2018-01-04,"As so many rock ’n’ roll stories do, the CBC Band’s began with the purchase of a guitar behind the back of a disapproving father.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/opinion/beatles-of-vietnam.html,1584," As so many rock 'n' roll stories do, the CBC Band's began with the purchase of a guitar behind the back of a disapproving father. When he was a young child in Vietnam, Tung Linh wanted a guitar, so his mother bought one for him. His father, Phan Van Pho, was a cook for French officials in Hanoi, and he wanted his children to become doctors or engineers, not musicians. When he found the guitar, he smashed it. But his wife, Hoang Thi Nga, nurtured Tung Linh's interest in American music, which he shared with two of his seven siblings: Bich Loan, a singer, and Tung Van on drums. When their father died in the late 1950s, Ms. Hoang went to work as a custodian on a Republic of Vietnam naval base. The family was poor, and those years were hard, but she wanted her children to be happy, so she nurtured their desire to perform American music. Ngoc Lan, an older brother who also played drums in South Vietnam's Navy band, noticed the talent of three of his younger siblings, and in 1963 he created a Vietnamese ""Partridge Family,"" before the American version existed. They were called the CBC Band, which stood for Con Ba Cu, ""Mother's Children."" It was a way to honor their mother for her unwavering support, Bich Loan said in a recent telephone interview. The children were so small when they started the band that no one could see the youngest, Tung Van, behind his drum set, even if he was standing. They had started with covers like ""You Are My Sunshine"" and Ray Charles's ""What I Say,"" just for fun. None of the children spoke English, so Ngoc Lan wrote the lyrics down phonetically in Vietnamese. From 1963 to 1965, the CBC Band performed in talent shows around Saigon. Then American troops began arriving in Vietnam in earnest, and their presence turned a hobby into a career. If the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival made stars of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Otis Redding, the escalation of America's troop presence in Vietnam did the same for the CBC Band. Ngoc Lan recognized a business opportunity in entertaining the large number of troops, and he reached out to local Vietnamese music promoters who contracted with the Army's Special Services Agency to book acts for officers' and enlisted men's clubs. A sister had performed with another band in Vung Tau, where music acts were in high demand because of the coastal city's status as an R & R spot for American servicemen. The CBC Band joined her there for several gigs, and she ended up joining the family band in 1969. By the early 1970s, the band was on the Army's approved entertainment list and made $325 a gig. The CBC Band traveled all over South Vietnam, wherever American troops were stationed. As the group played more gigs, they got tied in to the local rock and folk scene that included more established musicians like Khanh Ly, Trinh Cong Son and Elvis Phuong. Every Sunday, they would jam together, playing music inspired by American rock 'n' roll, ballads and folk songs. Word of the band spread through G.I. networks, and soon the demand for CBC Band shows grew so high that sometimes the band performed seven nights a week. Soldiers sought out Ngoc Lan and gave him tapes of rock 'n' roll songs they wanted the band to learn. Ray Charles and the Beatles were among the more popular requests that Bich Loan remembers. ""We would listen and copy them exactly like the record,"" said Bich Loan, who was in her early teens when the band began touring military bases. They played their own music, too, carefully crafted to sound like American rock, like ""Tien Yeu Tuyet Voi,"" or ""The Greatest Love."" Troops ate up those songs too. ""American soldiers loved us,"" Bich Loan said. ""They couldn't believe such young children could sing American music."" Troops showed their gratitude with money. The band members walked away from most gigs with more money in tips than what the clubs paid them. They gave all their earnings to their mother and, eventually, the CBC Band made enough to allow her to quit her job on the naval base. ""She had worked hard enough for us,"" Bich Loan said. It was war that brought the CBC Band success and financial security, but Bich Loan remembers that she and her brothers were too young to understand the complexities of the conflict. They wondered why Vietnamese were fighting each other, and why Americans had joined in, but that was the extent of their thoughts about it, she said. Everyone seemed to come together and enjoy the show when the CBC Band played, so why did they go off and fight afterward? Couldn't rock 'n' roll music stop a war? Perhaps not, but it could raise money for Vietnamese soldiers and war widows. In 1970, the CBC Band helped form Vietnam's first rock 'n' roll festival to raise money for military families. The Saigon government sanctioned the event, and Jo Marcel, a Vietnamese singer turned local nightclub owner and music producer whose given name was Vu Ngoc Tong, promoted it. In the end, the band was a casualty of war, too. Tung Linh received his draft notice in 1973, and he entered boot camp for six months of training. But his mother did what she could to help her son play music, which was what made him happy. She paid a handsome bribe to a high-ranking officer to secure her son's release from the army, arguing that she was old and needed him at home, and in any case, two older sons had already served in the navy. Yet normalcy proved elusive, as Tung Linh worried that he was constantly under police surveillance. When he drove his Honda to the market or around town and had to pass through security checkpoints, the guards always asked him why, given his young age, he wasn't in the army. Military officers began harassing Hoang Thi Nga because they suspected she had bought his release. Worried that the army might call for him again, his mother enlisted the help of some American and Canadian concert tour managers to organize a CBC Band world tour to get the band out of Vietnam. The promoters planned an 18-month tour, and the siblings figured they'd return home after it ended. Hoang Thi Nga cried when she said goodbye to her children. While the band was on the road, Saigon fell on April 30, 1975. Bich Loan and the other band members were asleep in Tibet when it happened; when they woke up and heard the news, they cried. They took refuge in a monastery and tried to figure out what to do. Their mother was still in Saigon. ""We thought we'd just be on a world tour for a year or so,"" Bich Loan said. ""We didn't think we'd never go back."" They were afraid to go back. There was a picture of the band members in downtown Saigon wearing American clothing and T-shirts with the American flag emblazoned on them. The new government branded the band members criminals and placed them on a most-wanted list because they had worked with Americans. The Phan siblings would later learn that their mother burned all their tapes and pictures of them with American troops, fearing retribution by the new government. They had been rock stars, but now they were refugees. In October 1975, the CBC Band entered the United States, thanks in part to a Vietnam veteran named Frank Ford, who worked in refugee resettlement after the fall of Saigon. Two or three years passed before band members could reach family in Vietnam. In the meantime, the band had hooked up with American and Canadian concert promoters and booked some shows. After a concert in Montreal, a friend helped them call Vietnam. Over the next two decades, band members became American citizens; sponsored relatives, including their mother, to relocate to the United States; and returned to Vietnam to perform. They still do, giving charity shows after which they donate all concert earnings to orphanages, nursing homes and other places that serve the poor. Young Vietnamese, for whom 1975 is a foreign world, are interested in the CBC Band and other singers and musicians from the era, Bich Loan said. It reflects a broader curiosity among the young about the history of South Vietnam, especially the people and the stories that the government has erased from official histories. The CBC Band has a following in the United States, too. Bich Loan and the other members who remained in America live in Houston, and the band performs for the city's large Vietnamese-American community. Ngoc Lan, who founded the band back in 1963, has moved back to Vietnam permanently. When Bich Loan reflects on the band's history, she feels grateful for Americans — for American music, for the American troops who supported the band and for Frank Ford the American vet who helped the band resettle in the United States. Yet the band members also lamented the war's destruction of Vietnamese life and land — a contradiction, like so much about the war was. Destroying a village in order to save it. Fighting while negotiating. Promises of liberation and freedom uttered by oppressive governments. Some Vietnamese kids brought joy to American G.I.s by performing rock concerts in the middle of a war that killed young people on all sides."
News,2018-01-04,"YUSHU, China — A Tibetan businessman who tried to protect his native language, and spoke to The New York Times about his efforts, defended himself in a Chinese court on Thursday against a criminal charge that his one-man campaign had fanned resistance to Chinese rule.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/world/asia/tibet-china-language-separatism-tashi.html,1041," YUSHU, China — A Tibetan businessman who tried to protect his native language, and spoke to The New York Times about his efforts, defended himself in a Chinese court on Thursday against a criminal charge that his one-man campaign had fanned resistance to Chinese rule. The one-day trial of the businessman, Tashi Wangchuk, 32, was held in his hometown, Yushu, a heavily Tibetan area in the northwestern Chinese province of Qinghai, two years after he was detained by the police. Mr. Tashi was charged with inciting separatism, which can bring up to 15 years in prison, after appearing in a news report and a video documentary by The Times in 2015. His defense lawyers said the prosecution's case rested largely on the video, which was shown during the trial. The trial lasted just a few hours, and the presiding judge told the courtroom that a verdict would be announced at a later, unspecified, date. China's Communist Party-run courts rarely find defendants not guilty, especially in politically contentious cases. His lawyers said that Mr. Tashi, speaking in Chinese, used the hearing to reject the idea that his efforts to revive Tibetan language and culture were a crime. Mr. Tashi has insisted that he does not advocate independence for Tibet, but wants the rights for ethnic minorities that are promised by Chinese law. ""Tashi argued that his idea was to use litigation to force local governments to stop ignoring Tibetan language education, and he was exercising his right as a citizen to criticize,"" Liang Xiaojun, one of Mr. Tashi's two defense attorneys, said outside the courthouse after the trial. ""He said that he wasn't trying to split the country,"" Mr. Liang added, ""but exercising his rights as a citizen of the People's Republic of China, which includes Tibetan citizens."" Court officials refused to allow a Times reporter into the trial, despite several requests. The trial received international attention, with diplomats from the United States, Germany, Britain, Canada and the European Union also showing up in unsuccessful efforts to attend. ""This action by the Chinese government sends a chilling message meant to silence its critics,"" Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokeswoman for The New York Times, said by email. Before the trial, a dozen or so of Mr. Tashi's relatives gathered outside the courthouse. They had been told that 15 of them could attend his trial, but in the end only three were let in. ""The main thing they said against him was the video,"" his brother-in-law, Sonam Tsering, said after the trial, referring to The Times's documentary about Mr. Tashi. ""They said that issuing those comments abroad was the biggest problem, that it insulted China."" Mr. Tashi's long captivity has been condemned by human rights organizations, exiled Tibetan groups and foreign governments, including the previous United States ambassador to Beijing. His case has also renewed focus on his warnings that the Tibetan language and culture are threatened by Chinese government policies to restrict education in the language and its use, even in Yushu, a remote town 12,000 feet above sea level on the highlands of western China. The western part of Qinghai and other heavily Tibetan areas nearby form a rim around the Tibet Autonomous Region, the heartland of historic Tibet. Critics warn that the Chinese government is stifling local culture across these areas by making Mandarin Chinese the dominant, or sole, language used in education, official business and the media. Since protests and riots against the Chinese government across Tibetan areas in 2008, Beijing has imposed smothering security, placing a heavy hand on Tibetan religious and cultural life. The pressures have magnified under President Xi Jinping, whose policies toward ethnic minorities reflect a belief that they can be pulled out of poverty and made loyal to Beijing by encouraging their assimilation into Chinese society, including education in Mandarin. But Mr. Tashi, a merchant who studied for three years in a Buddhist monastery, taught himself to write Tibetan with the help of a brother, and joined a ferment of Tibetan teachers, monks, singers, artists and businesspeople who have fought to defend the language and culture. ""There's quite a lot of activity to protect and promote the Tibetan language,"" said Gerald Roche, an anthropologist at the University of Melbourne in Australia who studies cultural and linguistic diversity in Tibetan regions of China. ""It's hard to get a real grasp of exactly what's going on because a lot of it is below the radar."" Mr. Tashi made a living selling Tibetan products online, including caterpillar fungus, an herbal remedy from the highlands that many Chinese believe has medicinal powers. But he also began his one-man campaign to advocate the protection of his own culture. ""In politics, it's said that if one nation wants to eliminate another nation, first they need to eliminate their spoken and written language,"" he said in the nine-minute video documentary for The Times. ""In effect, there is a systematic slaughter of our culture."" The documentary showed Mr. Tashi visiting Beijing, where he tried in vain to win support from courts, lawyers and China's main television network, CCTV. Two months after the documentary and accompanying article appeared, Mr. Tashi disappeared. His family learned after nearly two more months that he had been detained. On Thursday, few supporters appeared outside the court apart from Mr. Tashi's relatives. When asked, some residents nearby, especially Buddhist monks, said they had heard about his case. But most said they had not. Still, tensions over the future of Tibetan culture were visible in Yushu, which in Tibetan is called Gyegu. The day before Mr. Tashi's trial, the town bustled with ethnic Tibetans, most speaking in their own language: Buddhist monks played on smartphones; wizened herders haggled in a crowded market; young people strolled around in tracksuits despite the biting cold. Some residents said they worried about the declining ability of young people to read and write Tibetan; others said their children needed to grow up knowing both Tibetan and Mandarin Chinese. ""We have to study Chinese and Tibetan, both are important,"" said Tsering Dorje, a garment trader, who added that his three children were learning both languages. ""The problem now is that the main exams are all in Chinese, and Tibetan isn't so important, so of course families focus on Chinese."""
News,2018-01-04,Good Thursday. (We hope that all U.S.-based readers are staying warm.) Here’s what we’re watching:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/business/dealbook/trump-bannon-wolff-book.html,2945," Good Thursday. (We hope that all U.S.-based readers are staying warm.) Here's what we're watching: • Trump moves to open nearly all offshore waters to drilling. • Topic A in Washington is the lurid picture of the White House in Michael Wolff's new book. • A Justice Department decision on marijuana has whacked shares in one well-known publicly traded company.  • Toshiba has found a buyer for its bankrupt nuclear power business. Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. The energy industry is likely cheering the Trump administration's decision to allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States waters. Many others aren't. From The New York Times: The plan would give the energy industry broad access to drilling rights in most parts of the outer continental shelf, including Pacific waters near California, Atlantic waters near Maine and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The proposal lifts a ban on drilling, imposed by President Barack Obama in his final days in office, that protected more than 100 million offshore acres along the Arctic and Eastern Seaboard. Such a reversal deals a serious blow to Mr. Obama's environmental legacy and signals that the Trump administration is nowhere near done unraveling the environmental restrictions of its predecessor in an effort to promote domestic energy production. The drilling plan comes on the heels of a separate proposal to repeal offshore drilling safety regulations that were put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster, as well as a decision by Congress to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. In a statement, National Ocean Industries Association president Randall Luthi said: ""NOIA welcomes the bold and broad offshore leasing proposal released today by the Department of the Interior."" The new plan will not immediately green-light drilling. Finalizing the plan could take as long as 18 months, the NYT reports, and in the meantime, a number of states are expected to challenge the proposal in an effort to protect their coastlines. This summer Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey sent a letter to the Interior Department, saying the state ""strongly opposes any waters off our coastline being considered for inclusion in this leasing program."" In 2016, New Jersey generated $44 billion from tourism, supporting more than 321,000 jobs, the letter said. Mr. Christie isn't the only governor to oppose the proposal. The Washington Post reports that ""the Democratic governors of North Carolina and Delaware are also opposed. Gov. Rick Scott (R) of Florida, where beach tourism on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts generates nearly $50 billion and a half-million jobs annually, according to a Florida Atlantic University report, said Thursday that he adamantly opposes drilling off the state's coast.""  The WSJ reports that the studio could go for less than $500 million and shareholders may lose all their equity. According to the WSJ, ""the bidders include a group led by businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet; production company Killer Content working with philanthropist Abigail Disney; studio Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.; and investment firms Vine Alternative Investments and Shamrock Capital Investments."" Obviously, it's ""Fire and Fury,"" Michael Wolff's book on the White House. Why? Here's a sample of what Steve Bannon apparently told him, courtesy of the Guardian: Bannon, speaking to author Michael Wolff, warned that the investigation into alleged collusion with the Kremlin will focus on money laundering and predicted: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" And here's an excerpt from CNBC, from what Mr. Wolff says was an email that circulated around the White House in April, purportedly representing the views of Gary Cohn: It's worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns. Trump won't read anything — not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers; nothing. He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored. And his staff is no better. How did Mr. Trump respond? In a statement yesterday, the president said that Mr. Bannon had ""lost his mind."" Lawyers for the president later sent his former adviser a cease-and-desist letter. Caveat: Some of Mr. Wolff's interviewees have accused him of misrepresenting them, in ""Fire and Fury"" and in the past. But Axios says he has tapes this time. The political flyaround • Paul Manafort sued Robert Mueller to limit the scope of the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in last year's presidential election. DealBook's White Collar Crime Prof doesn't rate his chances. (NYT) • Will 2018 be the year that Mr. Trump follows through on his hard-line trade stance and starts imposing tariffs? (NYT) • Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that New York State would challenge the new tax plan in court, and asked the state legislature to add a statewide payroll tax. (NYT) • Mr. Trump shut down a White House commission on voter fraud. (CNN) • The administration must decide on two policy choices this year that could batter the American solar industry. (WaPo) • Would Twitter ever suspend Mr. Trump's account? (NYT) The Dow Jones industrial average broke past 25,000 points for the first time Thursday. Yes, 1,000 point moves aren't what they used to be, but the pace of the rally is still notable. If the blue-chip index closes above 25,000, it will have taken the Dow just 23 trading sessions to go from 24,000 to 25,000. That would be the fastest move from one millennial marker to the next on record, writes the WSJ's Amrith Ramkumar. ""Of course, each 1,000-point milestone gets easier as the index marches higher. The climb from 24000 to 25000 was a 4.2% gain, compared to a 7.1% climb when the Dow hit 15000 in 2013."" A strong rally in technology shares has powered stocks in the new year. The Nasdaq Composite surpassed 7,000 on Tuesday, and both it and the Standard & Poor's 500 index are at record highs. In fact, this might be the best start to a year for the S.&P. 500, writes Instinet's Frank Cappelleri. ""The SPX has logged consecutive gains of least 50 basis points while notching 52-week new highs. That may not sound too outlandish, but according to SentimenTrader, this combination has never happened before. Thus, it equates to the BEST start ever…"" So can the bull market keep going? David Tepper of Appaloosa Management thinks so. Mr. Tepper said on CNBC: ""Explain to me where this market is rich? It's not rich with the tax thing that just changed earnings projections. With earnings forecasts going up and interest rates where they are, how is this market expensive? I don't see the overvaluation. World growth is higher."" We're believers that correlation does not necessarily prove cause causation, but ... maybe it has something to do with this, via the AP: Attorney General Jeff Sessions is rescinding the Obama-era policy that had paved the way for legalized marijuana to flourish in states across the country, two people with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press. Sessions will instead let federal prosecutors where pot is legal decide how aggressively to enforce federal marijuana law, the people said. As the AP notes, the move will make it more difficult for people to figure out whether it is legal to grow or consume marijuana. As for Scotts: The company has become a publicly traded proxy for the business of marijuana growing, with its C.E.O. having openly courted the pot industry. Political backlash: It's coming from Republicans as well. Take Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado: — Michael J. de la Merced A number of cannabis stocks tumbled on the news that Mr. Sessions is rescinding the Obama-era policy, reports MarketWatch's Ciara Linnane. Nevada-based Cannabis Sativa and Colorado-based cannabis farmer GrowGeneration are both down more than 20 percent. Even cannabis companies based in Canada, which is preparing to legalize marijuana later this year, are taking a hit. Toronto-based medical marijuana distributor Supreme Cannabis Co. and its Ontario-based rival Canopy Growth are both off more than 12 percent. Vancouver-based medical marijuana company Aurora Cannabis is down nearly 11 percent. The context: Shares of cannabis companies had rallied this week on the start of recreational marijuana sales in California. Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF, the largest marijuana-focused exchange-traded fund, ended Wednesday up 23 percent this year, after surging 74 percent in 2017. It's down nearly 9 percent Thursday. Toshiba agreed today to sell its Westinghouse Electric unit to Brookfield Business Partners for $4.6 billion, finally separating itself from its troubled nuclear division. The terms: Brookfield's offer comprises approximately $1 billion in equity, $3 billion in debt financing and the rest by assuming obligations like pensions and environmental charges. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30, pending approval by the Delaware federal bankruptcy court. The context: Westinghouse's troubles — including delays and cost overruns at two U.S. nuclear plant projects — led to the business filing for bankruptcy last year. That has been one of the biggest drags on Toshiba, saddling the Japanese company with $6 billion in write-offs and the sale of its prized chip business to help keep the conglomerate afloat. Tara Lachapelle of Gadfly adds this as well: — Michael J. de la Merced As the music streaming giant moves toward a public market listing — it confidentially filed paperwork last month — Wall Street and Silicon Valley are waiting to see if other privately held tech giants also eschew the traditional I.P.O. process and just flip their shares onto a stock market. From Ben Sisario and Michael in the NYT: Deal makers and analysts have said a direct listing is available to Spotify because of its already wide name recognition among potential investors, which makes the standard I.P.O. meet-and-greets largely unnecessary. Uber, Airbnb and a few other giant start-ups also have readily recognizable brands and little need for the money raised in a standard I.P.O. process. If they follow suit, investment banks might stand to lose out on big fees — though it's worth noting that Spotify has retained several firms as advisers. Depends who you ask. Security experts say that both Meltdown (which affects virtually every Intel processor) and Spectre (which afflicts most other processors) have big costs. From Cade Metz and Nicole Perlroth of the NYT: The two problems could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of a computer. There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent — an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services. Companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft have started working on updates. And chip makers may have to eventually swap out all affected hardware. Investors have already shown concern about the effects: • Shares in Intel fell 3.4 percent yesterday. (The chip giant played down the problem.) • Shares in AMD jumped 5.2 percent. • Shares in Nvidia leapt 6.6 percent. Intel's chief executive, Brian Krzanich, sold off a large chunk of his stake in the company after the chip maker had been made aware of the security flaws. An Intel spokeswoman told MarketWatch the sale was unrelated to Meltdown and Spectre. The tech flyaround • Expect smarter cars and digital assistants this year, Brian Chen writes in his C.E.S. preview. (NYT) • Technology means 2018 will be more chaotic, as our interconnected world amplifies butterfly effects, Farhad Manjoo predicts. (NYT) The new law does away with corporate tax deductions for performance-based pay — like the huge stock-based packages C.E.O.s have enjoyed since the 1990s. Here's what Sarah Anderson of the social justice think tank Institute for Policy Studies told Renae Merle of the WaPo: ""We would like to think this would result for an overall decline in compensation that it could inject some rationality."" The dissenting view Skeptics think that the law will simply prompt companies to increase executives' base salaries. Let's use Ted Sarandos of Netflix as an example: 2017: $1 million salary, $9 million bonus target 2018: $12 million salary The tax flyaround • Bank of America Merrill Lynch thinks the new tax code will boost corporate profits this year, but create headwinds later. (NYT) • The overhaul includes help for craft breweries, but critics say that the biggest alcohol companies will enjoy the biggest benefit. (WaPo) Countries like Russia and Venezuela are drawn to the lack of central authority — particularly U.S. authority — inherent in Bitcoin and other digital money systems. But their own currency experiments may not work out quite as they hope, according to Nathaniel Popper, Oleg Matsnev and Ana Vanessa Herrero of the NYT: That's because Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are decentralized systems with no one in charge, while the Russian and Venezuelan plans would give the leaders of both countries a measure of control over the new currencies. That runs counter to some of the most basic concepts of virtual currency. Where Bitcoin is still a no-go zone: Merrill Lynch, which has blocked clients and financial advisers from investing in the currency or in related financial instruments. What people are missing about Bitcoin: Glenn Hutchins, the co-founder of Silver Lake, told the FT that while he has invested about $5 million from his family office on companies working with virtual currency, he has yet to buy a Bitcoin. ""Bitcoin could turn out to be the winner; it also could turn out to be Betamax,"" he said. Its shares fell 2 percent in after-hours trading yesterday. Here's why: In July, Elon Musk predicted that Tesla could build 20,000 Model 3s by December. In September, analysts projected that Tesla would deliver 15,900 Model 3s in the fourth quarter. Yesterday, with the analysts in FactSet's compilation of estimates still expecting 4,100 Model 3s in the quarter, Tesla announced that it had delivered 1,550. What Tesla says: ""During Q4, we made major progress addressing Model 3 production bottlenecks, with our production rate increasing significantly towards the end of the quarter."" What a critic says: ""The premise of the stock's sky-high valuation has long been of Tesla eventually dominating the auto industry. That notion has hardly ever seemed more fanciful,"" writes Charley Grant of Heard on the Street. The Times's chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott, discussed the year in Hollywood and Mr. Scott had a suggestion: The movie business might start by designating a pool of money — maybe equivalent to the value of the Miramax and Weinstein Company libraries, and the budgets of every Brett Ratner film and some fraction of Pixar's worldwide revenues — to fund movies written and directed by women. And Meryl Streep responded to comments about her lack of comments on the Weinstein accusations in an interview with Cara Buckley of the NYT: ""I don't want to hear about the silence of me. I want to hear about the silence of Melania Trump. I want to hear from her. She has so much that's valuable to say. And so does Ivanka. I want her to speak now."" • The White House named Geoffrey Berman, Rudy Giuliani's law partner, as the interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

News,2018-01-05,"SAN FRANCISCO — The sale of recreational cannabis became legal in California on New Year’s Day. Just four days later, the Trump administration acted in effect to undermine that state law by allowing federal prosecutors to be more aggressive in prosecuting marijuana cases.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/california-defiant-in-face-of-federal-move-to-get-tough-on-marijuana.html,1093," SAN FRANCISCO — The sale of recreational cannabis became legal in California on New Year's Day. Just four days later, the Trump administration acted in effect to undermine that state law by allowing federal prosecutors to be more aggressive in prosecuting marijuana cases. A memo by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday was widely interpreted in the nation's most populous state as the latest example of Trump vs. California, a multifront battle of issues ranging from immigration to taxes to the environment. And on marijuana, once again California reacted with defiance. ""There is no question California will ultimately prevail,"" Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, said. ""The public has accepted legalization's inevitability. It will be very difficult for Sessions to bring us back to a mind-set that existed five years or a decade ago."" The head of California's Bureau of Cannabis Control, Lori Ajax, said legalization would proceed as planned, ""consistent with the will of California's voters."" Although medical marijuana is legal in some form in 29 states and recreational marijuana is sold in six states, it remains banned by the federal government and is classified in the same category as heroin. It is too early to tell how federal prosecutors around the country will interpret the Sessions memo, which rescinded guidance by the Obama administration that had discouraged the bringing of charges involving marijuana-related crimes in states that have legalized the drug. The memo reminded prosecutors that ""marijuana activity is a serious crime."" Mr. Sessions said in a statement that ""stricter enforcement by prosecutors will help tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country."" Leading voices in California's marijuana industry said Thursday that while the announcement by Mr. Sessions might have punctured some of the excitement surrounding legalization, it did not change their plans to take part in what is the world's largest legal market for recreational pot. ""This has changed zero on the ground for us,"" said Steve DeAngelo, the executive director of Harborside, a company with dispensaries in Oakland and San Jose. ""I don't think this is going to result in any serious attempt to shut down the legal cannabis industry,"" Mr. DeAngelo said. ""It's more of a delaying tactic than a knife to the throat of the industry."" Californians approved Proposition 64, which allowed for recreational use of the drug, by a 57 percent to 43 percent margin in a November 2016 ballot initiative. Carla Lowe, the Northern California director for the advocacy group Citizens Against Legalizing Marijuana, said she hoped the Sessions memo would focus attention on a drug that was being produced at much higher levels of potency than in previous decades. ""I'm concerned what this is doing to developing brains in young people,"" she said. ""I would hope this would get the attention of some of the people who are law-abiding citizens,"" Ms. Lowe said. ""But I don't know that there's much hope in California."" Lawyers who specialize in cannabis said they were skeptical that federal prosecutors would be more aggressive in California for several reasons, including a perceived reluctance of jurors in the state to convict marijuana cases, especially small-scale ones, that do not involve other crimes. Lawyers also point out that the Trump administration has not yet appointed its own federal prosecutors in California. Additionally, lawyers said the Justice Department is constrained by the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, which has been attached to congressional budget bills in recent years, and prohibits the Justice Department from spending money on the implementation of state medical cannabis laws. ""The message to the industry is that nothing has really changed,"" said Sean McAllister, a lawyer who specializes in cannabis cases in California and Colorado. ""The industry has flourished in an environment of uncertainty for the past 20 years. Sessions's memo does not create any additional uncertainty that did not already exist."" But the uncertainty is nonetheless substantial. The Sessions announcement may give further pause to large companies that have been reluctant to invest in the marijuana business because of fear of retaliation by federal authorities. And small-scale veterans of the industry — the cottage marijuana businesses in the famed Emerald Triangle of Northern California, among others — face potential threats of forfeiture, as they always have. If prosecutors were to crack down, sellers and anyone caught in possession of the drug could go to jail. Yet as a practical matter, officials from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration have said that combating opioid trafficking is much more important than cracking down on marijuana given the agency's stretched resources. Russ Baer, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration, said in an interview last year that most of the agency's resources were being spent on combating opioids. ""We are spread thin,"" he said. Local law enforcement is also stretched. Thomas D. Allman, the sheriff of Mendocino County, one of the three counties in the Emerald Triangle, said Thursday that investigating marijuana cultivation was not a high priority, unless it was ""out of control"" or involved other crimes, such as the environmental damage. ""If somebody is obeying state law, I'm going to say there are not many local law enforcement agencies who are going to be rushing out to do an investigation,"" Sheriff Allman said. ""There are many other crimes we can focus on that impact the safety of the community."" Hezekiah Allen, the executive director of the California Growers Association, a cannabis industry group, says while marijuana growers are concerned about the more aggressive federal posture, longtime growers have seen it before. ""Folks that have been at this for a few generations remember that this is a cycle,"" Mr. Allen said. ""Federal enforcement ebbs and flows and it has for decades. This is another enforcement cycle but this time we have a state government that is working with us. And frankly enforcement wasn't all that effective in the past."" On Thursday, among customers at the Berkeley Patients Group, a dispensary that sells recreational marijuana, there was defiance and eye-rolling among those asked about the Sessions memo. ""To me, they've always wanted to destroy everything Obama did. It's all in that vein,"" said Barry Alexander, 61, a supervisor at a Whole Foods supermarket. Mr. Alexander was skeptical that the Trump administration could do much to change legalization in California. ""We're like Texas, we're our own country,"" he said. Ian Carr, 23, a construction worker who bought cannabis at another dispensary in Berkeley, the Cannabis Buyers Club, shrugged off the prospect of a federal crackdown. ""I've been using marijuana since before it was legal,"" he said. ""So I'd just go back to that."""
News,2018-01-05,SAN FRANCISCO — The virtual currency boom has gotten so heated that it is throwing the list of the world’s richest people into disarray.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/technology/bitcoin-ripple.html,1295," SAN FRANCISCO — The virtual currency boom has gotten so heated that it is throwing the list of the world's richest people into disarray. Consider what has happened to the founders of an upstart virtual currency known as Ripple, which has seen its value skyrocket in recent weeks. At one point on Thursday, Chris Larsen, a Ripple co-founder who is also the largest holder of Ripple tokens, was worth more than $59 billion, according to figures from Forbes. That would have briefly vaulted Mr. Larsen ahead of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg into fifth place on the Forbes list of the world's richest people. Other top Ripple holders would have also zoomed up that list as the value of their tokens soared more than 100 percent during the last week — and more than 30,000 percent in the last year. The boom has turned Ripple into the second largest virtual currency, within striking distance of the original behemoth, Bitcoin. The explosion in Ripple's value over the past month is the starkest illustration yet of how the mania around Bitcoin  has spilled over into a broader universe of virtual currencies. These coins — with names like Cardano, Stellar, and Iota — are generally new twists on the Bitcoin technology, which uses a decentralized network of volunteer computers to keep a record, known as a blockchain, of all transactions. While most of these currencies were worth nearly nothing a year ago, many are now responsible for creating billionaires — albeit with rapidly fluctuating fortunes. If this is a tulip fever, the fever has spread to chrysanthemums and poppies. Mr. Larsen's soaring wealth sparked a few congratulatory messages on Twitter on Thursday, even if the value of Ripple — and his Forbes ranking — dropped later in the day. But his net worth, and the ballooning value of Ripple tokens, mostly drew comments about the irrationality of the virtual currency markets, which appear to be largely driven these days by the fear of missing out, or FOMO. ""This is beyond insane,"" said Jeremy Gardner, an investor who previously worked at the virtual currency hedge fund Blockchain Capital, which invested in Ripple. ""There's absolutely nothing driving this rally except rampant FOMO, misinformation, and speculation."" Ripple, whose tokens are known as XRP, is far from the only virtual currency being fueled by the hysteria. In 2017, there were 29 tokens — including Einsteinium and Byteball — that rose more than Bitcoin's remarkable 1,600 percent jump, according to OnChainFx, a data provider. Nearly 40 virtual currencies are worth more than $1 billion — when all the outstanding tokens are counted at their current value — despite many of them not having been used in any sort of transaction other than speculative trading. Against this backdrop, Ripple could be considered a staid institution, though one with a colorful history. Ripple was invented in 2012 by Jed McCaleb, a programmer who had created Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange that later dissolved in disgrace. Mr. McCaleb designed Ripple as a faster and more efficient version of Bitcoin, without the mining process that Bitcoin uses to distribute new coins and secure the network. Mr. Larsen joined Mr. McCaleb early on to create a company, also known as Ripple. The company helped develop an open source Ripple software that makes it possible to move money between digital wallets. The Ripple token is one of the currencies that can be transferred with the software. Mr. McCaleb later left Ripple in an acrimonious divorce, though he retained a sizable number of Ripple tokens. His holdings were worth around $20 billion at Thursday's prices, putting him close to 40th on the Forbes list. (The actual list is only published once a year, and no big virtual currency holders have been officially added.) Mr. McCaleb has since created a competitor to Ripple, known as Stellar. Stellar has risen even faster than Ripple in recent weeks, with all outstanding Stellar tokens — known as Lumens — worth around $14 billion on Thursday, making it the seventh largest virtual currency. In contrast, all the outstanding Ripple tokens were worth $140 billion on Thursday, while all Bitcoin were worth $250 billion. Yet the fortunes of Mr. McCaleb and Mr. Larsen are not nearly as durable as those of other people on the Forbes list given that the value of virtual currencies fluctuates wildly. If Mr. Larsen wanted to access his wealth by selling Ripple tokens for dollars, it would likely drive down the value of Ripple tokens — and his riches. Mr. McCaleb and Mr. Larsen did not respond to questions about the recent price increases. Mr. Larsen was Ripple's chief executive from 2012 until he stepped down last year to become the company's executive chairman. During his tenure, Ripple focused on helping banks use its software to shift money between different foreign currencies, something that most banks currently do through a cumbersome process involving separate accounts in every country where they operate. Ripple has said it has signed up more than 100 banks to use the company's technology, including American Express and Banco Santander. But banks do not need to use Ripple tokens for Ripple's software to transfer dollars, euros and yen. That point appears to be lost on many small time investors who are buying Ripple tokens. Most of the buying and selling of Ripple tokens is happening in South Korea, according to data providers that track virtual currency exchanges, where ordinary investors have thrown money at a wide array of virtual currencies. Several virtual currency hedge fund investors said that they have talked to banks and heard about interest in Ripple's software, but not its tokens. ""I'm not aware of banks using or planning to use the XRP token at the scale of tens of billions of dollars necessary to support XRP's valuation,"" said Ari Paul, a co-founder of the hedge fund BlockTower Capital. Ripple has so far announced that one company, a Mexican money-transfer business, is planning to use the Ripple token. Brad Garlinghouse, who took over as Ripple's chief executive last year, said in an interview this week that other institutions are also using — or looking at using — XRP, but the company could not name them because of confidentiality agreements. Mr. Garlinghouse said he thought the rising value of Ripple tokens was justified, given the company's growth and the size of the foreign currency markets that Ripple wants to tackle. ""It's clear that people increasingly understand that we are solving a very large problem,"" he said. Ripple has attracted the ire of Bitcoin fans because Ripple has a greater degree of centralized authority in Mr. Garlinghouse's company, even though the Ripple software is open source. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies were designed to operate without companies or governments in charge. But the company Ripple, if not the XRP token, has won a following among top figures in government and finance who are interested in bringing the ideas introduced by Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. The company's board includes the former top financial regulator in New York state, Benjamin M. Lawsky, and Gene Sperling, who was the director of the National Economic Council under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Still, even virtual currency analysts who believe in Ripple's software have said there is a big difference between Ripple the company being successful, and Ripple the token gaining enough traction to justify current prices. ""An impossibly long list of things already needs to go right for XRP to become a reserve currency for banks,"" Ryan Selkis, a virtual currency analyst, wrote in a post on Thursday. But, Mr. Selkis added, that doesn't mean Ripple's price won't keep ascending. Why? ""Because this is crypto, and everyone in the industry is now slinging crack crypto cocaine to retail addicts,"" he wrote."

News,2018-01-05,"LIVERPOOL, England — Josep Maria Bartomeu, the president of Barcelona, preferred to focus on what he had gained, rather than what he had lost.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/sports/soccer/liverpool-coutinho-barcelona.html,1236," LIVERPOOL, England — Josep Maria Bartomeu, the president of Barcelona, preferred to focus on what he had gained, rather than what he had lost. A month or so after Paris St.-Germain paid Barcelona $267 million to make Neymar the most expensive soccer player in history, Bartomeu set aside all of the bitterness, anger and regret that had swirled around the deal to talk about the ""opportunity"" before him and his club. ""We have earned €105 million,"" or about $127 million, he said, ""and there is more to invest in football, in assets. Let's see what we do."" Almost exactly five months later, the watching world now has an answer. What Barcelona has done with all of that money, all of that opportunity, is sign Ousmane Dembélé, a 20-year-old French winger of bright promise, for an initial $126 million, and allocate even more — upward of $175 million, the second-highest fee in history — to the transfer of Philippe Coutinho, Liverpool's Brazilian playmaker. That deal is not yet complete, of course. As of Thursday, Barcelona had yet to submit an offer to Liverpool, much less agree on a price. It seems inevitable now, though. Coutinho, just as he did in August during an earlier round of these same rumors, has sustained a convenient injury that will keep him out of Liverpool's F.A. Cup game with its fierce rival Everton on Friday; he firmly believes that he has played his last game for his club, that a move is now a matter of when rather than if. But the when is still uncertain. Jamie Carragher, the former Liverpool defender, might be expected to feel his former club should keep hold of one of its crown jewels until the end of the season. The best thing for Liverpool to do, he wrote on Twitter this week, is to agree on a ""BIG fee"" for Coutinho to leave during the summer, warning that Liverpool's place in the top four would be ""seriously risked"" if he departed this month. That plenty of others, far less partial, share Carragher's conviction is significant. From Barcelona's point of view, it is 9 points clear at the top of the La Liga standings, with its rival Real Madrid a distant 14 points back. Barcelona does not seem to need Coutinho to claim the championship. And Coutinho would not be able to represent the team in the Champions League anyway, having already played in that competition this season for Liverpool. From the player's perspective, while it is a move he has long craved, the timing is less than ideal: Such a drastic change of scenery in a season that leads into a World Cup carries a little more risk than a key figure in Brazil's plans might like (even if escaping the brute physicality of the Premier League might be an attraction). That is not to say there is no logic to it. Allowing Coutinho — earmarked as a long-term replacement for Andrés Iniesta — a six-month period to settle in would allow Barcelona to see him flourish more fully next season. More immediately, a move now also might ease the domestic workload on the 33-year-old Iniesta, meaning the team's coach, Ernesto Valverde, could reserve him for Champions League adventures. Far more important than when, however, is why. As recently as September, Barcelona's director of professional sports, Albert Soler, claimed the Neymar-inspired hyperinflation of Europe's already superheated transfer market was ""a model of football we are not used to"" and insisted that Barcelona ""won't get involved in that."" Yet whenever Coutinho joins, Barcelona will possess two of the most expensive players of all time. P.S.G. and Manchester City might have started the fire, but Barcelona is happily fanning the flames, and it is doing so at a time when the club most at risk of being burned is Barcelona itself. It is now almost a decade since Pep Guardiola took charge of the team that would change soccer. In the summer of 2008, Guardiola was promoted from manager of Barcelona's B team after only one season and handed the reins of a senior side that included Lionel Messi, Gerard Piqué, Iniesta, Xavi Hernández and, soon, Sergio Busquets. Xavi — now in lucrative semiretirement in Qatar — apart, the spine of that team remains in place. It has been graceful to watch — Barcelona always is — but it is an aging team, its beauty slowly dimming, its glory gradually fading. Busquets is a comparative spring chicken, as is Ivan Rakitic, both 29. Messi, Piquè, Iniesta and Javier Mascherano are all the wrong side of 30. They are still expensive, though. Last year, Barcelona announced record revenues of $854 million, when its chief executive, Oscar Grau, boasted that ""even teams in the N.F.L. and N.B.A."" did not make that much money. The club's salary bill accounted for an eye-watering 63 percent of that (clubs are recommended to spend no more than 70 percent of turnover on salaries), even before a spate of renewals — including that of Messi — are taken into account. Barcelona's squad is the highest-paid in all of soccer: more than Real Madrid, more than Manchester City, more than P.S.G. Barcelona is adamant it can afford it, though its existence is perhaps a little more hand-to-mouth than the scale of its wealth might suggest. Barcelona projects its revenues will increase again this year, breaking the $900 million mark, but then they will have to if the club is to keep pace with its rapidly inflating salaries. When P.S.G. deposited the $267 million check to cover Neymar's buyout clause, Barcelona had a chance to break that cycle. As Bartomeu said, it was an ""opportunity,"" and a golden one. For years, Barcelona has recruited desperately poorly. It is a club that the world's finest players would do almost anything to join — as Coutinho, and Luis Suárez before him, prove — and yet its approach to acquisitions is haphazard and chaotic. Last summer, what was supposed to be a move for P.S.G.'s Marco Verratti somehow became the sale of Neymar. A deal for Nice's Ivorian midfielder Jean Michael Seri collapsed amid rumors that talks had only begun because Barcelona fans kept mentioning his name. Liverpool held firm on Coutinho. Last month, Atlético Madrid threatened to complain to FIFA about Barcelona's pursuit of Antoine Griezmann. The club might have added Dembélé and Nélson Semedo last summer, two bright young things, but a midfield in desperate need of rejuvenation was bolstered only by Paulinho, 29, signed from China's Guangzhou Evergrande. The contrast with Real Madrid is stark. Florentino Pérez, Real's president, has moved away from his Galactico model of signing household names in favor of sweeping up the best young talent in the world, including Marcos Asensio — also a Barcelona target — and Vinícius Júnior, an all-but-untested Brazilian teenager. The current league standings might not suggest it, but Real Madrid has its future in hand. Barcelona remains locked to its past, seemingly unable to think about replacing the players that have brought so much success. Bartomeu has talked about re-energizing the production line of young talent from La Masia, its famed academy, but that seems more a pipe dream than a plan. Five months ago, Barcelona had a fortune with which to rebuild itself. Whenever Coutinho arrives, most of that money will be gone. And yet the problems, the issues it has refused to confront for so long, will remain."

Before the bridge was painted its iconic international orange, architects also considered a proposal from the U.S. Navy for a striped design that would make the structure more visible to ships and airplanes. The distinct reddish-orange hue was chosen to complement the bridge's natural surroundings: the hills, the fog and the San Francisco Bay. The city hired the engineer Joseph Strauss to build the 1.7-mile-long bridge, the longest and tallest of its kind at the time. The bridge opened four years later to great fanfare. The Times called it ""one of the greatest engineering structures of man,"" and Mr. Strauss penned a poem, ""The Mighty Task Is Done,"" for the occasion. ""The bridge is a triumphant structure, a testimony to the creativity of mankind,"" the historian Kevin Starr wrote in 2010, offering ""enduring proof that human beings can alter the planet with reverence.""

News,2018-01-05,"LOS ANGELES — The reboot of the once-and-again Los Angeles Rams will get a huge lift on Saturday, when they host the Atlanta Falcons in the first round of the N.F.L. playoffs.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/sports/los-angeles-rams-playoffs-chargers.html,1640," LOS ANGELES — The reboot of the once-and-again Los Angeles Rams will get a huge lift on Saturday, when they host the Atlanta Falcons in the first round of the N.F.L. playoffs. Dave Stanley will be there, just as he was in 1986, the last time the Southern California version of this team hosted a home playoff game. ""I'm so ready for this,"" said Stanley, 57, a lifelong Angeleno who is part of a group of die-hard Rams fans who wear hollowed-out watermelons on their heads when they sit in a section at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum known as the Melon Patch. Melon-heads like Stanley experienced two decades of N.F.L. diaspora while their beloved Rams played in St. Louis from 1995-2015. The Rams returned to the Los Angeles region in 2016, then pulled off a stunning turnaround this season, winning 11 games, compared with four in 2016, a feat nearly matched by the newly rechristened Los Angeles Chargers, who relocated up the 405 from San Diego this season and almost made the playoffs. The teams' resurgences came at a critical time. Less than 10 miles from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Rams are building a $2.6 billion stadium and entertainment district in Inglewood that the Chargers will also call home. The stadium is now a vast construction site a few miles south of Los Angeles International Airport. The teams will soon begin asking their fans to spend thousands of dollars on personal seat licenses, the unpopular permits that are required before they can spend thousands of dollars more on season tickets. Convincing fans to spend hefty sums for seat licenses, season tickets, club seats, and nearly 300 luxury suites with price tags in the low-to-mid six figures, will be a far harder task than getting them to buy modestly priced tickets at the Coliseum or StubHub Center in Carson, where the Chargers play for now. With licenses for the best seats potentially costing more than $100,000, Stanley and thousands of other loyalists are nervous they won't be able to afford a seat in the new stadium. There are financial limits to his love for the Rams, fanatical as it may be. ""If they say, 10, 15 grand for a seat license, it'll be DirecTV, here I come,"" said Stanley, who works at hardwood specialty products company. The success of those sales campaigns will amount to a referendum not just on the Rams' and Chargers' popularity, but on the wisdom of the N.F.L.'s decision to let two teams move to Los Angeles. If the stadium is perceived as a pricey and exclusive luxury, the league's goal of reintegrating itself into the country's second largest market could sputter further. Attendance at Rams games fell 24 percent this year, as the novelty factor of their maiden 2016 season wore off. The number of households watching Rams games dipped six percent this season. The Chargers struggled to fill the 30,000-seat StubHub Center, a soccer stadium where Chargers fans were often outnumbered by fans of the visiting team. ""Everyone knows we're the new kids of the block,"" said Dean Spanos, the Chargers owner. ""We knew coming up here there wasn't going to be a red carpet rolled out for us. We have to earn our way in."" Still, on the field, things couldn't have gone much better the past few months. After the Rams' dismal first season back in Los Angeles, the precocious rookie head coach Sean McVay secured the Rams' first division title since 2003. Powered by quarterback Jared Goff and Todd Gurley II, an M.V.P.-caliber running back, the Rams became the first team in the Super Bowl era to have the highest scoring offense a year after having the lowest. The Chargers lost their first four games, then won nine of their last 12, fueled by the league's best passing game. If the team hadn't lost three games by a field goal or less, it might have squeezed into the playoffs. However the teams perform, N.F.L. officials say they are confident the city will embrace the league, even though the Rams and Raiders abandoned the region after the 1994 season. Many owners believe the market, with about 15 million residents, can support two teams. They say the N.F.L.'s flash and speed is a natural fit in the entertainment capital of the world. Kevin Demoff, the chief operating officer of the Rams, echoed this view and shrugged off the early hiccups. He blamed the decline of the team's television audience on competition. Certain games took place at the same time as Chargers games, or had to fight for eyeballs with the national game of the week. And while attendance fell, he said, the team is attracting a more devoted following, not just casual fans eager to say they attended a game. ""As you drive around the city, you see Rams car flags, and you know you've made it when you see car flags,"" Demoff said. He described reviving and building a new fan base as a long-term process. ""Like building the stadium, this is going to take years."" Winning helps. According to Fanatics, the largest online seller of N.F.L. gear, sales of Rams merchandise jumped 50 percent this season, the largest increase after the Eagles and Jaguars. Demoff insisted the new stadium, which won't open until 2020, will help define the team in Los Angeles, and befit a league that has grown into a $14 billion-a-year juggernaut. Its scale and scope suggest as much. The 300-acre city-within-a-city will be 3.5 times larger than Disneyland Park in Anaheim. During the 14 months since ground was broken on the site of the old Hollywood Park Racetrack, crews have moved more than six million cubic yards of dirt, enough to fill 600,000 dump trucks. More than 12,000 tons of steel have been erected, helping give shape to much of the lower bowl of the venue. Many of the columns that will support the roof that will cover the 70,000-seat stadium are now in place. The building is designed to create the buzz needed to attract attention in a city that craves it. The stadium will include 275 luxury suites and 16,000 club seats, and an oval two-sided video screen that will hang from the roof. The teams are banking on these and other attractions to create a must-see venue. ""People in this market want to go to see people and to be seen,"" said Amy Trask, who grew up in Los Angeles and worked for the Raiders for 29 years, including several years when they played here. ""If the Rams and Chargers can make their ticket a sexy ticket, it will insulate them in the down years."" Though the Rams and Chargers will share the stadium, and have their own locker rooms, the teams are, in many ways, not equals, Trask and others said. When they moved back from St. Louis, the Rams were greeted by fans like Stanley, who followed them during some of the 46 years they played in Southern California. The team also had the advantage of announcing their move first. Rams' owner, E. Stanley Kroenke, is financing the stadium. The Chargers, who will be Kroenke's tenant, arrived a year later, after they failed to persuade lawmakers in San Diego to help them build a new stadium there. The team has shallow roots in Los Angeles, having played here just one year as part of the old A.F.L. Spanos was encouraged by the team's strong finish, which helped lift merchandise sales and the team's following on social media. But many loyalists from San Diego have not followed the team north. One San Diego resident was so angry at the Chargers that he raised $22,000 online to help pay for a billboard near the StubHub Center to criticize the N.F.L. and team for abandoning San Diego. The fan, Joseph MacRae, has also rented planes that flew banners over the stadium on game day, something he plans to do again on Saturday before the Rams-Falcons game. ""The message I'm trying to get across is that the N.F.L. really messed this up,"" MacRae said. ""People in San Diego are never going to root for a team in Los Angeles. No fan deserves to lose their team."" For now, though, the focus is on the Rams. Though the team's offense was understandably lauded, the team's defense improved measurably under the new defensive coordinator, Wade Phillips, one of the great defensive minds of his generation. Phillips, who most recently created the Denver Broncos' buzz-saw defense that won the 2016 Super Bowl, is 70 years old, nearly four decades older than his 31-year-old boss McVay, who is known as an offensive whiz. Under Phillips, defensive tackle Aaron Donald has become a force of nature. Donald led the N.F.L. in forced fumbles, was tied for fourth in quarterback hits, and led all defensive tackles with 11 sacks. On offense, Gurley led the league with 2,093 yards from scrimmage and scored 19 total touchdowns. Goff also had a talented group of receivers to throw to, including rookie Cooper Kupp, but also Robert Woods and Sammy Watkins. The Rams had the best kick returner in Pharoh Cooper, the best punter in Johnny Hekker, and the best kicker, Greg Zuerlein, until he injured his back. And with one of the youngest rosters in the league, the Rams have the potential to succeed for years to come, something they will desperately need to win over a city with little appetite for the mediocre that is still getting to know the team. ""The opening of the new stadium will be a panacea for a while, and people will be focused on ribbon cutting and flyovers,"" said David Carter, the executive director of the Sports Business Institute at USC. ""But you better have the right high-octane product that captivates market. Around here, if you're not in, you're out."""

Unlike them, he already has a pedigree: he has shown his work alongside Mark Rothko, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell while they were still alive and in their prime. In 1958, a large Bertschmann canvas was featured in the Carnegie International exhibition in Pittsburgh, a rarefied achievement for any artist, let alone one in his mid-20s. Since then, Mr. Bertschmann has painted or drawn nearly every day of his adult life, producing a body of work that has been praised by some of the art world's foremost tastemakers. Yet he has remained virtually unknown. ""I had to make money,"" Mr. Bertschmann, 86, said one morning in late November as he sat at the dining table of his light-filled, art-filled apartment-studio near the South Street Seaport. And he did, working as a freelance graphic designer creating logos, packaging and advertising for brands like Pond's cold cream and Bufferin. His success at his day job ensured that he wasn't hungry, and while he has produced thousands (he has no idea how many thousands) of fine-art paintings, drawings and collages in wildly varied styles, he never persistently sought gallery representation. ""Harry's never been a salesman,"" said Mary Bertschmann, his wife of more than 50 years. ""He didn't get his art out there for them to see."" Nor did he carouse with his more exhibitionistic contemporaries at Cedar Tavern, participate in splashy happenings or attract art-world gossip. ""Also, we had started our own small press, and Harry was doing great designs for Harper & Row, like this wonderful thing,"" she said, pointing to a fetchingly illustrated poetry anthology published in the 1970s. "" We were so into our world, plus, of course, with a child."" Over the years there were some exhibitions and acquisitions, notably a 140-work retrospective in 1997 of both his commercial and fine art in Basel, Switzerland, where Mr. Bertschmann was born and raised. But these accomplishments never amounted to a self-sustaining fine art career. As he reached his 80s, humility and obscurity started getting old, and costly. Now the Bertschmanns find themselves in a tenuous financial position. Mr. Bertschmann no longer does much graphic design, and Mrs. Bertschmann recently retired as the executive director of the Huguenot Society of America. She said that they have been ""suffering financially."" Despite living in a lofty one-bedroom apartment near the South Street Seaport, they are retired renters who will not benefit from the gentrification of the neighborhood. On the bright side, she added, a man named Peter Hastings Falk had arranged for a couple of gallery owners to visit in December. Mr. Falk, an art historian, curator and appraiser who has spent much of his 40-year career promoting unknown, highly accomplished artists, considered Mr. Bertschmann an unrecognized master. ""There couldn't be a better example,"" he said. Mr. Bertschmann's work, he added, ""is at such a high level that it is as compelling or more so than his more famous peers', all of the members of the New York School of the '50s and '60s."" With one crucial difference. While a large Bertschmann painting might, by Mr. Falk's estimate, sell for about $25,000, for an excellent Rothko you could add three zeros to that figure. And then multiply by three.  Mr. Bertschmann is an elfin man with comely features and a warm smile, Mrs. Bertschmann a strikingly beautiful woman of 85. Last month, both of them were neatly dressed in similar gray V-neck sweaters as they nervously prepared their apartment for the gallerists' visit. He rarely fails to apologize for what he calls the mess in the living room, where his artwork rests against walls and sits on and in numerous metal cabinets. But the space isn't remotely untidy. His wife explains his fastidiousness by pointing out, ""He's Swiss."" Long before the arrival of Art Basel, the international art fair, Mr. Bertschmann's hometown was an ideal city for a budding artist, with world-class museums, a great university and, most important, an express train that reached Paris in under three hours. ""We would hop on the train,"" Mr. Bertschmann recalled. ""I was 16 or 17. These trips to Paris were very enlightening for me."" Right after World War II, he said, ""everybody was poor, and along the Seine there were booths, and you saw such fabulous stuff."" He showed off four 18th-century Japanese prints and an African bronze that he'd bought back then for next to nothing. ""Imagine being that age,"" Mrs. Bertschmann said, ""and having a taste for those things."" From 1947 to 1951, Mr. Bertschmann attended the Basel School of Design. He studied under Armin Hofmann and apprenticed with Fritz Bühler, both giants of Swiss graphic design. After graduation he moved to the United States, eventually landing in Cleveland, where his artistic output became more inventive and prolific. His work appeared in several galleries, a painting was selected for the Carnegie International, and the Cleveland Museum of Art invited him to submit a painting for its annual group exhibition. It won first prize. Cleveland was also where Mr. Bertschmann met Mary, who at the time was married to an adman who was part of a prominent Cleveland Heights family. ""One day Harry said he wanted to do some sketches of me,"" Mrs. Bertschmann said. ""So I sat for Harry, and he did some sketches, and then he suddenly got up and came over and gave me a kiss. I was very proper, brought up in the Victorian way."" She continued, ""Something happened — I guess the coup de foudre, as they say in French — and we became lovers. Harry and I were lovers for 10 years before I finally got disentangled from my husband. Before I got the courage."" Her husband's agency transferred him to New York, she said, and he adapted quickly to Madison Avenue. ""He turned into a 'Mad man,'"" she recalled. ""Two martinis for lunch."" The couple rented a three-bedroom duplex with a deck in the West Village that had just been vacated by the actress Tammy Grimes, who had recently separated from Christopher Plummer. Before the move, Mrs. Bertschmann recalled, ""I said, Tom, we'll never be able to afford this apartment — it's $350!"" In 1962 she persuaded Mr. Bertschmann that as an artist, he, too, should come to New York. When her marriage finally ended, her husband moved out of the duplex, and in 1966 she married Mr. Bertschmann — ""my true love,"" she said. They stayed in the duplex for four decades, until about 15 years ago, when the landlord died and their rent (then $3,000 a month) was about to jump. Now they face a similar fate with their current apartment. The once-modest Seaport neighborhood is getting fancier. The Best Western a few doors down is transforming into a Cipriani boutique hotel. With both of them on fixed incomes and with no retirement plans to speak of, their high monthly rent, Mrs. Bertschmann said, has them ""hanging by a string."" Of course, at some point they should have bought an apartment, an option that Mrs. Bertschmann said they considered ""so many times."" But they were busy leading creative, exhilarating New York lives. They spent 40 years in an affordable duplex in the most cinematic part of the West Village, so why move? They raised a daughter (Isabelle Kellogg, now a luxury marketer with a grown daughter of her own) and had interesting friends and neighbors, like an editor who worked with Diana Vreeland at Vogue and later Graydon Carter, the longtime Vanity Fair editor, who bought the townhouse next door. Every summer they took a hiking vacation in the Swiss Alps and visited Mr. Bertschmann's family in Basel. But now their need to pay the bills is overshadowing even their desire for Mr. Bertschmann's work to get its due. He still draws every day, but he no longer paints. ""He doesn't have the money for art supplies,"" Mrs. Bertschmann said. So the couple are putting their hopes in the hands of Mr. Falk, promoter of the undiscovered. Mr. Bertschmann first met him back in 2013 after reading an article about a show of works by another overlooked painter, Arthur Pinajian, and deciding that he would like some recognition before he met the same fate. (Mr. Pinajian had been dead 14 years before he was discovered.) Mr. Falk had organized that show, and when Mr. Bertschmann approached him, he was skeptical at encountering yet another hopeful. ""I thought, Oh, no,"" Mr. Falk said. ""Because I can only take on one or two a year."" Still, he agreed to look at Mr. Bertschmann's work. The reaction was immediate. ""I was astounded,"" Mr. Falk recalled. The more he saw, the more he liked. ""Harry's special,"" he said. ""I knew it as soon as he was showing me digital images, and then I was absolutely convinced when I saw thousands of works over 60 years in his apartment."" Through his company, Artist Discovery Group, Mr. Falk brings together museum curators, gallery owners, critics and collectors — the art market's power centers — and works to catalyze interest in the artists. The main obstacle, as he sees it, is the ""pathological myopia of the art world."" In its narrow view, an artist, especially an older one, whose work hasn't already been certified by the market barely even exists. If Google and auction records scarcely know that Mr. Bertschmann is alive, it hardly matters that in 1986 Henry Geldzahler, the larger-than-life curator at the Metropolitan Museum, visited his studio and found his work stellar. Mr. Geldzahler put in a good word at several major galleries, the Bertschmanns said, but when Mr. Bertschmann pursued those leads nothing came of them. To help fill the data vacuum and provide scholarly legitimacy, Mr. Falk enlisted Robert C. Morgan, a member of his company's advisory board of scholars and curators, to write an essay characterizing and validating Mr. Bertschmann's work. He also found a small gallery on the western edge of SoHo called Studio Vendome to mount a show in 2014. But it was poorly attended, partly a result of a small marketing budget. Such are the challenges of promoting underrated talent. Since the Studio Vendome show, Mr. Bertschmann has had some qualified success — the Los Angeles County Museum of Art recently acquired one of his travel posters for its permanent collection — but more setbacks. He read about a gallery that specializes in older artists, submitted his materials in person, and was told that there was a waiting list of 250 artists ahead of him. Then in November, Mr. Falk told him about Christy and Chester Murray, lifelong collectors and neophyte gallerists. One night about five years ago, a friend and some wine persuaded the Murrays, who had recently retired, to buy a store in Quogue, on the East End of Long Island, and turn it into an art gallery. Mr. Falk thought their taste for New York School painters might draw them to Mr. Bertschmann's work. In 2015 Mr. Falk had helped the Murrays bring an exhibition of more than 20 Pinajian works on paper to the Quogue Gallery, and it sold out. (To date, total Pinajian sales from all venues have exceeded $3.5 million, according to Mr. Falk.) Hoping to repeat this success, he set up a meeting with the Murrays last month at the Bertschmanns' apartment. The Murrays spent more than two hours there, and left feeling transported. ""We walked in thinking that maybe Harry would be part of a group show,"" Christy Murray said, ""and left planning a solo show during some of the busiest weeks of the summer."" Less than a week later, they sent an email clarifying those plans, which center on a solo exhibition filling the Quogue Gallery for three weeks next summer. They also decided to double the size of their booth at Art Palm Beach, a fair that starts Jan. 17, to accommodate seven large Bertschmann canvases. And, as with their previous shows, they expect to buy one or more of Mr. Bertschmann's paintings for their private collection, which, in addition to emerging and overlooked artists, includes works by Picasso, Miró and Giacometti. The Bertschmanns were almost afraid to believe that their hoped-for lifeline had arrived, but they allowed themselves to celebrate with a bottle of wine. ""It was so wonderful to meet them and to have them be so interested in everything that Harry had done,"" Mrs. Bertschmann said. ""They just kept looking and looking."" She called the visit ""flabbergasting"" and ""magical."" Even Mr. Bertschmann, always affable but rarely effusive — again, he's Swiss — was visibly happy. Could it really be true that all his years of ""painting like a demon possessed,"" as Mr. Falk put it, could finally be rewarded? Mr. Falk called the Murrays' plans ""a good fresh start for Harry."" Small galleries, he noted, can be more adventurous, less in thrall to youth and trends, than large ones. ""Ultimately, what I'd like to see for Harry is a museum exhibition,"" he said, ideally at the Swiss Institute in New York, which should ""finally pay homage to one of their own, an artist who's really, really deserving."" Representatives of the Swiss Institute have met with Mr. Bertschmann and expressed an interest in working with him, but they plan their shows far in advance, probably too far to help the Bertschmanns out of their current financial plight. While Mr. Falk views the big picture, Mr. Bertschmann trains his eye on the sketch pad directly in front of him. Every day without fail, he continues to put pencil to paper with such single-minded focus that he doesn't see his own career arc, or plan for the future. The other day, a guest raised the subject of where he hoped his body of work would end up after he was gone. He appeared genuinely stumped. ""Actually,"" he said, ""I've never given it a thought."""
News,2018-01-05,The bustling United States economy is beginning to benefit some American workers who have not gotten a taste of the recovery and have been most in need of relief.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/business/economy/jobs-report.html,1284," The bustling United States economy is beginning to benefit some American workers who have not gotten a taste of the recovery and have been most in need of relief. That picture was reinforced by a report on Friday from the Labor Department, which showed an increase of 148,000 jobs last month. The figure fell short of economists' expectations, but some of the most impressive job gains in the past year were in blue-collar and service industries that pay a decent salary. Over all, average hourly earnings were 2.5 percent higher in December compared with the year before, scarcely keeping up with inflation. But other data shows that wages have increased most for the least-educated workers and for people in many industries that are generally low-paying. ""Growth is strong, and the benefits of this growth have been widely shared,"" Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Indeed.com, a job-search site. ""This has been a year in which some of the gaps in the economy that had been growing narrowed a bit."" Manual-labor positions are the kinds of jobs that President Trump has promised to bring back in droves, so progress could be politically important. Hiring picked up fastest in construction and mining. Manufacturing, which lost jobs in 2016, expanded last year at a respectable clip, part of a global resurgence. Reflecting the economy's resilience, overall hiring in 2017 was only slightly lower than in 2016 — and it has risen for 87 consecutive months, a remarkable feat. The unemployment rate was steady at 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. The numbers point to an economy that still has some room to grow. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Mr. Trump cited the unemployment rate as evidence that the economy is ""only getting better!"" When he took office last January, the rate was 4.8 percent. Most economists say presidents do not generally determine the economy's course, and it is too early to measure the hiring effects of the tax cut signed into law last month. But Mr. Trump's agenda may be having an impact on the economy in other ways. His push to dismantle regulations on businesses seems to have emboldened corporations to start putting more money into machines and plants, the kind of spending that drives broad growth. A separate survey of manufacturers released on Wednesday suggested that American factories have picked up their orders, production and hiring over the past year. Democrats offered a less sanguine view of the labor market, asserting that most Americans were still enduring paltry raises and that the Republican tax plan was a boon only to the upper stratum of the country. Among the solutions advocated by Democrats is to increase the minimum wage, as 18 states did on Jan. 1. ""The American economy is unbalanced,"" Representative Joe Crowley of New York, the leader of the House Democratic Caucus, said in a statement. ""Workers struggle to find financial security while special interests, corporations, and the richest among us enjoy lavish tax breaks."" Wages have been one of the most intensely debated puzzles of the labor market, with incomes growing at a more sluggish rate than the hiring demand would suggest. There are signs beneath the surface, though, that more widespread wage growth may be around the corner. The security industry, for example, where pay is below average, showed a 7 percent increase in hourly earnings in November from a year earlier. Workers in clothing stores and food services — two huge, generally low-paying businesses — saw wages rise by around 4 percent in that period. In areas where unemployment has dipped below the national rate, pay has begun to accelerate. Cities where joblessness is 3.5 percent or lower have had an impressive 4 percent year-over-year increase in earnings, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics. In Indianapolis, where unemployment reached 3.1 percent in November, wages for jobs in the private sector rose by nearly 5 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. ""If the unemployment rate everywhere gets to 3.5 percent, then wage growth everywhere will get to 4 percent,"" Mr. Shepherdson said. That kind of tightening may nudge some employers who have resisted giving raises. ""The wage growth rate kicking in isn't an automatic thing that happens in the economy,"" said Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, a job-listing platform. ""It requires employers to feel that friction, that competition for talent, to change what they offer recruits."" E-commerce companies have begun to raise wages in hot warehouse markets, such as Memphis or the Inland Empire in Southern California, said Bill Ravenscroft, a senior vice president at Adecco Staffing USA. The agency employs around 60,000 workers, hiring more during the holiday season, and places many in distribution centers and warehouses often used by e-commerce giants. But employers are not taking that approach across the board. Many are vying for pickers, packers and shippers by offering new perks. Logistics companies have begun providing on-site child care, or reimbursing employees who need to put their children in day care while they work. Some companies are entering workers in raffles every week to win laptops, televisions and tablets, or are bringing food trucks to their warehouses and paying for employees' lunches. ""These types of benefits in the past, you associated them with Silicon Valley, start-up companies,"" Mr. Ravenscroft said. ""They weren't synonymous with your traditional employers."" Clients are hesitant to offer permanent wage increases, he said, but that could change if the jobless rate continues to dip. Bob Peterson, the chief executive of Melton Truck Lines, said he had been feeling the job market's heat all year, and that he now had no choice but to raise pay for his 1,600 drivers. ""With unemployment this low, anyone worth their salt has got a job and probably a darn good one,"" Mr. Peterson said. Melton operates in 48 states and has offices in five. The tight job market has been especially tough on Mr. Peterson, because he requires a drug test for everyone who comes through the door. Many fail, especially after several states legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use. ""There's guys and gals that like to smoke weed, but they can't drive a commercial vehicle because it's prohibited,"" Mr. Peterson said. ""Some people get here and we find out, oops, they have been smoking or injecting."" Mr. Peterson has not given raises in two years, he said, because when he had asked his clients to increase their rates, they threatened to hire another trucking company. He is planning to increase salaries by 10 percent in 2018. Part of the reason, he said, was that he was seeing hiring pick up in the construction business and in manufacturing, two sectors that he competed with for able bodies. ""No one is having an easy time hiring blue-collar workers today,"" Mr. Peterson said. Those pressures are bearing down on manufacturing, which added a solid 196,000 jobs last year, and construction, where payrolls increased by 210,000. Mining employers also posted solid gains, bucking a trend of job losses in recent years. The crash in oil prices in 2014 was particularly hard on jobs in the mining sector, which includes support services in oil fields, and had ripple effects on construction and manufacturing, partly because American companies make much of the world's mining equipment. Oil prices have begun to climb, and that may be one piece of the expansion in all three sectors, economists said. The rest of the world is also in the midst of a strong recovery, helping to drive an American uptick in productive blue-collar work. ""The manufacturing upturn story is a global story,"" Mr. Shepherdson said. ""It's happening everywhere. You can't take credit for the recovery in Europe and China."""
Review,2018-01-05,SEDUCED BY MRS. ROBINSON How ‘The Graduate’ Became the Touchstone of a Generation By Beverly Gray Illustrated. 282 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $24.95.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/books/review/beverly-gray-seduced-by-mrs-robinson-the-graduate.html,993," SEDUCED BY MRS. ROBINSON How 'The Graduate' Became the Touchstone of a Generation By Beverly Gray Illustrated. 282 pp. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. $24.95. Aside from the joyfully cocky title of a classic 1965 song by the Who, the phrase ""my generation"" is not generally used by anyone of my generation — or anyone else either. While those living it make their own discoveries, mistakes and art, generational descriptions are almost always the work of elders (""the younger generation""), youngers (""our parents' generation"") or marketers (Silent, Greatest, Boomer, Pepsi) attempting to commodify the unstoppable cultural changes that accompany the forward movement of time. But here comes ""Seduced by Mrs. Robinson: How 'The Graduate' Became the Touchstone of a Generation,"" in which the Santa Monica-based entertainment writer Beverly Gray doubles down on the declaration embedded in her book's subtitle by inserting herself throughout the pages as a leading touchstone toucher: By ""a generation,"" she really means ""my generation."" And to prove it, the author, who has previously published books about the filmmakers Roger Corman and Ron Howard, pops up in first person throughout an otherwise average recounting of the making of ""The Graduate"" and its reception to say, ""I was there."" At first, I couldn't figure out why Gray kept chiming in. (""How well I remember!"" she volunteers, describing thoroughly well-documented changes in the 1960s California educational system.) After all, last month marked the 50th anniversary of the movie's release, and that is reason enough to throw ""The Graduate"" a poolside cocktail party on its own merits. Why strain so hard to lay a personal generational narrative on a Hollywood history far more interesting than Gray or me or you or most any individual reader who was or wasn't around in 1967 to help make the movie the surprise hit it was? (Why, too, does the author devote the whole middle section of her book to what is essentially a scene-by-scene recap, from opening logo to closing moments? Those who are interested in ""Seduced by Mrs. Robinson"" have presumably seen the movie, and those who have not seen the movie will not be enlightened by Gray's chatty narration for the visually impaired.) A half-century has passed since the bewildered college graduate Benjamin Braddock, played with star-making originality by a then largely unknown Dustin Hoffman, floated, directionless, in his parents' glassy Beverly Hills pool, and was told (by someone of his Parents' Generation) that the future lay in ""plastics."" It has been a half-century since Anne Bancroft smoldered as the seductive Mrs. Robinson, an unhappy woman who was the opposite of bewildered — an adult mature enough to know she was trapped in the hell of plastic marital conventions. It has been 50 years since Hoffman, Bancroft and the incandescently creative team of the director Mike Nichols and the screenwriter Buck Henry took Charles Webb's small 1963 novel of domestic discontents and turned it into a movie that epitomized huge shifts in both popular culture and Hollywood commerce. Then again, all this has been recounted before, with nuanced and perceptive synthesis, by Mark Harris in his popular 2008 history, ""Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood,"" now a classic of cultural reporting and analysis. (Gray refers to Harris, a friend of mine, more than once.) And, for a fine magazine-length version, a reader can call up Sam Kashner's 2008 Vanity Fair piece ""Here's to You, Mr. Nichols: The Making of 'The Graduate.'"" ""Seduced by Mrs. Robinson"" is a puzzling project. It is also a compilation of an awful lot of distracting clichés. The famous camera shot of Hoffman framed by the crook of Bancroft's stockinged leg is a moment ""that lives on in film history."" The voices of the movie's fans ""still echo through the years."" Gray cites notebook entries the producer Lawrence Turman made ""when the project was merely a gleam in his eye."" She explains that ""The Graduate"" appealed to ""high-spirited young rebels who delighted in thumbing their noses at the status quo."" She interviews Hoffman ""at a film industry gathering, held at an upscale Beverly Hills Mexican eatery,"" where ""he proved surprisingly approachable, despite the throngs of fans waiting their chance to schmooze with the star."" Recent allegations of sexual harassment by Hoffman may dim a reader's envy at the opportunity for schmoozing. Do not take this as a nose-thumb so much as a brow-furrow. The author's interview with Hoffman took place in 2008 — and here we come to a clue to understanding the book's tortured structure, its pained search for an angle: Most of the research seems to have taken place a decade ago. The majority of Gray's direct reporting comes from two long interviews with Turman, now 91, who, as a Hollywood novice, was canny enough to obtain the rights to Webb's novel. The first of those interviews took place in 2007. Turman published his own book, ""So You Want to Be a Producer,"" in 2005. (The second Turman interview took place in 2015.) Gray says in her acknowledgments that her book ""rose like a phoenix from the ashes of a previous project."" Was it shelved after ""Pictures at a Revolution"" and the Vanity Fair history of ""The Graduate"" came out in 2008, making her version a making-of too many? Is it out now by the luck of a marketed golden anniversary? This formerly youthful moviegoer would like to know. In the meantime, she recommends looking up the provocative re-review written by Roger Ebert in 1997 to mark the movie's 30th anniversary. The movie critic, who died in 2013, was in his youthful-enough 20s in 1967 when he declared ""The Graduate"" ""the funniest American comedy of the year."" Three decades later, he saw that Hoffman's Benjamin was an ""insufferable creep,"" and that Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson — ""sardonic, satirical and articulate"" — was ""the only person in the movie you would want to have a conversation with."" Ebert was talkin' 'bout my generation."
News,2018-01-05,WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and South Korean officials met in Washington on Friday to begin formally renegotiating a free-trade pact that has served as a source of conflict between the two allies. The meeting came at a moment of heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula and unease in the broader region.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/us/politics/us-korea-trade-talks.html,1100," WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and South Korean officials met in Washington on Friday to begin formally renegotiating a free-trade pact that has served as a source of conflict between the two allies. The meeting came at a moment of heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula and unease in the broader region. The countries focused on their main areas of interest, with the United States emphasizing trade in automobiles and what it considers various barriers to exports, American negotiators said. ""We have much work to do to reach an agreement that serves the economic interests of the American people,"" Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in a statement after the meeting. President Trump has called the six-year-old agreement a ""horrible deal"" for the United States and has pledged to rework it. Over a series of meetings in the coming months, American negotiators hope to further open Korean markets to American cars and to smooth irritants in the trading relationship. But clashes over trading terms could risk dividing the longstanding allies at a critical time, as North Korea seeks to drive a wedge between South Korea and the United States, analysts say. North Korea restored a cross-border telephone hotline with its southern neighbor on Wednesday, just one day after Mr. Trump said he had a ""much bigger"" nuclear button than the one North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, had boasted of having on his desk. ""The reality is, it's a fraught moment between the U.S. and South Korea in terms of their alliance,"" said Sue Mi Terry, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Renegotiating the deal at this juncture ""is going to widen the gap between Seoul and Washington,"" she said. The Trump administration's approach to trade has also caused consternation in the wider Pacific region at a time of geopolitical unease. The White House is emphasizing trade deals with specific countries rather than broader economic alliances. The approach counters efforts by the Obama administration, which sought to tie countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean together under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It also comes as China moves to piece together a sphere of influence through regional trade agreements and infrastructure projects. Since withdrawing its support for the T.P.P., the Trump administration has sought trade concessions from Japan. But Japan has focused on a version of the T.P.P. that does not include the United States and has expressed an unwillingness to settle for a narrower trade deal. With South Korea, the White House's overarching goal for renegotiating the trade pact is to reduce America's trade deficit, which was $17 billion in 2016. But analysts view such a goal with skepticism, saying that the tendency of the United States to import more than it exports is linked to larger economic factors like saving and spending rates, not the terms of trade agreements. Each side was likely to look to the other on Friday to articulate their goals for the renegotiation, said Wendy Cutler, the former chief United States negotiator for the deal. The United States will probably focus on areas of the agreement that it believes have not met its expectations, Ms. Cutler said, including trade in automobiles and, potentially, financial services and procedures related to importing goods. She noted that the Trump administration had not notified Congress of its intention to renegotiate the agreement, something that is required before substantial changes are made. That may suggest that the United States is not seeking to significantly alter the terms of the deal or that, although it is seeking changes from South Korea, it is not willing to make big concessions itself. The United States Korea Free Trade Agreement, America's largest trade pact after the North American Free Trade Agreement, was negotiated during the President George W. Bush's administration and signed by the two countries in 2007. It  set off enormous protests from Koreans in 2008 over concerns about the safety of imported goods, such as beef. And it was not ratified by Congress until 2011, after President Barack Obama reworked the pact. The agreement took effect in March 2012, cutting almost all tariffs and many other trade barriers between the countries. The deal opened South Korea, now the United States' seventh-largest export market for goods, to imports of American agriculture, services and investment, and the American market to Korean cars and other manufactured goods like washing machines. Trade officials estimated in 2007 that the lower barriers to trade under the agreement would increase annual exports of American goods by up to $11 billion, a claim that Mr. Obama repeated. But, as the Trump administration has argued, that did not happen. ""Since KORUS went into effect, our trade deficit in goods with Korea has doubled from $13.2 billion to $27.6 billion, while U.S. goods exports have actually gone down,"" Mr. Lighthizer, said in a statement in July. ""This is quite different from what the previous administration sold to the American people when it urged approval of this agreement. We can and must do better."" Much of the American trade deficit in goods with Korea is generated by automobiles, a key reason cars will probably be a primary focus of the talks. Korean car brands like Hyundai and Kia are popular in the United States, but American carmakers have struggled to gain as much ground in South Korea as their European and Asian competitors. The trade picture looks more balanced when factoring in services. In 2016, the United States had a $27.7 billion trade deficit in goods with Korea, but a $10.7 billion surplus in services — about a third higher than before the agreement entered into force. Caroline Freund, a former senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that changes to the agreement could potentially reduce the bilateral trade deficit the United States runs with South Korea. However, any changes are unlikely to have any significant impact on the overall trade deficit that the United States runs with the rest of the world, she said. James W. Fatheree, the vice president of Asia for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said the trade deficit was a ""flawed metric"" for measuring the success of the deal and that many in the business community support the deal because it had been good for their industries. Mr. Fatheree said the Koreans had fallen short of putting into effect some areas of the agreement, but he pointed to high levels of American good exports to Korea in 2017, substantial gains for American agriculture and rising service exports. ""We want to make sure we keep the agreement intact,"" he said."

News,2018-01-06,"MEDELLÍN, Colombia — President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela ordered a temporary shutdown of air and maritime traffic with three Caribbean neighbors on Friday, accusing smugglers there of seeking to plunder his country.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/world/americas/maduro-venezuela-travel-shutdown.html,564," MEDELLÍN, Colombia — President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela ordered a temporary shutdown of air and maritime traffic with three Caribbean neighbors on Friday, accusing smugglers there of seeking to plunder his country. In a televised address, Mr. Maduro said he had halted all flights and ship traffic to Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao for 72 hours. He accused the three countries of running black markets by siphoning everything from copper to food before selling the items. ""They take away gold from this country illegally, and make it legal to sell there; they take away coltan, they take away diamonds, they take away all food products,"" Mr. Maduro said. ""I didn't want to take a measure like this one, but I am ready to take even more radical measures."" The Caribbean islands, which are short distances from Venezuela's northern coast, have long hosted black markets for Venezuelan contraband, trading everything from illegally mined minerals to narcotics. The countries, however, have become better known under Mr. Maduro's presidency as the landing site of boats of hungry Venezuelans fleeing their country's food shortages. Many refugees have fled illegally, so the closure is unlikely to stop those departures. But it will cut off Venezuelans wishing to travel by air at a time when many airlines refuse to fly to the country because of safety concerns. Aruba is the site of a large refinery that Citgo, the American subsidiary of Venezuela's state oil company, has been touting plans to refurbish. The state oil company is reeling from disastrous production declines and is falling behind on debt payments. It was unclear what prompted the timing of Mr. Maduro's crackdown. ""I hope that during these 72 hours the leaders of these countries will take the measures we've asked for more than two years"" against smugglers, Mr. Maduro said. ""Mafias are waging war on our electricity, they steal our copper and they sell it legally."" Mr. Maduro has closed borders in the past after alleging that smugglers were robbing the country, especially at times when his government faces problems. In late 2016, he shut down the border with Colombia, alleging that mobsters there were hoarding currency. The previous year he had ordered a longer closure and declared a state of emergency along the same border, saying that food, fuel and other goods were being smuggled there. The measures had little effect on smuggling in the area, residents said, but did prevent many thousands of Venezuelans from crossing the border to buy food during shortages. Venezuela is also struggling with hyperinflation, and the Maduro administration ordered more than 200 supermarkets to cut prices back to last month's levels, Reuters reported on Saturday. News of the discounts spread quickly, leading hundreds to mass in front of stores before daybreak. When one major supermarket in wealthier eastern Caracas did not open for hours, people began pounding on the storefront. Armed National Guard soldiers later arrived at the store and ordered people into clear lines. They eventually let the crowd through in small groups just before midday, but people quickly emerged disappointed as only crackers and washing liquid were discounted, according to Reuters. ""I can't feed my kids with this,"" Jesus Gudino, 29, a moto-taxi driver and father of three told Reuters, indicating the small plastic bag in his hand. ""I've been here since 4 a.m. This is a mockery. What can I do? I have to leave this country."""

This documentary tells of Madden's rise, his conviction for stock fraud and money laundering in the 2002 and his subsequent re-entry into his own shoe superpower. ""He'll often say to me when we are worrying about something, 'Seven years ago I was sitting in a jail cell,' "" the Steve Madden executive Ed Rosenfeld told The Times in 2013. "" 'We aren't going to die if this shoe doesn't sell.' "" WHAT HAPPENED, MISS SIMONE? (2015) on Netflix. Liz Garbus's documentary on the singer-musician Nina Simone combines Simone's diary entries and family photos with archival images, concert footage and interviews. It's the story of a child prodigy who fought a racist society to become an influential singer (of ""To Be Young, Gifted and Black"" and ""Feeling Good,"" to name just two) and a civil rights activist. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the film ""bracingly urgent,"" writing that Simone's ""metamorphosis culturally and politically features a glittering cast of figures — James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, Lorraine Hansberry, among others — and makes for thrilling viewing."""

What advice do you have for avoiding these penalties or negotiating more favorable terms?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/realestate/how-difficult-is-it-to-break-a-lease.html,433," Q. My wife and I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in Long Island City, Queens. We are thinking about moving next spring, months before our lease expires. Our landlord informed us that if we break the lease, we would either incur a penalty equal to one and a half month's rent, or be held responsible for the rent until the space is rented to someone else or the lease expires. We see no reference to such a penalty in our lease. What advice do you have for avoiding these penalties or negotiating more favorable terms? A. Sign a rent-stabilized or market-rate lease and you are bound to its terms. Unless the apartment is rendered uninhabitable because of poor conditions, your only way out would be to sign a written agreement with the landlord terminating the lease. ""New York law is unforgiving to tenants who want to break their lease,"" said Jennifer Addonizio Rozen, a Manhattan tenant lawyer. Your landlord is offering you a way out: Pay the hefty fee and you can terminate the lease. This is not a penalty found in your lease, but instead an offer to let you out of it. This type of agreement would not be found in the lease. Instead, ""That would be a separate contract where your landlord would accept something in exchange for releasing you from all liability under the lease, "" Ms. Rozen said. If you don't take the offer, the landlord does not have to re-rent the apartment and could continue to try to collect rent from you until the lease expires. If you don't pay, the landlord could sue you. You do have some other options. You could ask to assign the remainder of the lease to a new tenant. ""But that should be done very carefully,"" Ms. Rozen said. ""And in accordance with the law."" If you are able to assign the lease, the agreement would be directly between the new tenant and the landlord. You would be ""out of the picture completely,"" Ms. Rozen said. Companies like PadSpin can help find a replacement tenant if your landlord is willing to agree to a lease assignment. You could also try to find someone to sublet, using a company like Flip. Although both rent-stabilized and market-rate tenants have the right to sublet, rent-stabilized tenants must show that they intend to return to the apartment at the end of the sublet. (So if you don't plan to return, subletting would not be a viable option.) If you do sublet, you would still be responsible for the rent if your subtenant failed to pay."
News,2018-01-06,Humira is the best-selling prescription drug in the world. You may have seen the commercials.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/business/humira-drug-prices.html,1152," Humira is the best-selling prescription drug in the world. You may have seen the commercials. Because of Humira, a woman with rheumatoid arthritis can wash her puppy in the bathtub, another with colitis can stroll happily through a fair packed with food vendors, while a third suffering from psoriasis can go to the gym without hiding her neck. But they probably wouldn't all look so relieved if they saw the bill. The price of Humira, an anti-inflammatory drug dispensed in an injectable pen, has risen from about $19,000 a year in 2012, to more than $38,000 today, per patient, after rebates, according to SSR Health, a research firm. That's an increase of 100 percent. Pharma bosses probably miss Martin Shkreli, the reigning villain of the industry. If you'll recall, Mr. Shkreli, as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, acquired Daraprim, a drug used to fight infections in AIDS patients, and then raised the price overnight to $750 a pill from $13.50. He also trolled critics and spent $2 million on a one-of-a-kind Wu Tang Clan album, before his conviction on three securities fraud charges last year. For a time, Mr. Shkreli's antics, along with the soaring price of EpiPens, sold by Mylan, deflected attention from the rest of the industry. A more typical play for drug companies — the Humira play — is to start at a high price and keep raising it ever higher, but incrementally. ""What they have done with Humira is just as unfair, just as morally wrong, but they did it over five years,"" said Ben Wakana, a former Obama administration spokesman who became executive director of Patients for Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group, because his younger brother couldn't afford Humira without the financial support of their parents. ""People are skipping doses, people are rationing, people are going into bankruptcy because of this drug,"" he said in an interview, arguing that Humira is both more expensive per dose and has a far higher volume than Daraprim. AbbVie, which was spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013, declined to comment. How much you actually pay out of pocket, and whether you can afford Humira at all, depend on your insurance and eligibility for discounts. Anne Marie Garza, 51, an administrative assistant in Houston who suffers from colitis and Crohn's disease, said she had held off buying her latest dose because her insurer had changed. She was trying to see if she could avoid an out-of-pocket payment of more than $1,200, one of two she would have to make this year, on top of her rising expenses for vitamins and supplements to manage the disease. She has relatively good insurance, but the payments will strain her budget. ""During the holidays, I was contemplating what am I'm going to do,"" she said. ""I was thinking should I just go on a liquid diet, because I can't afford this."" It's a difficult choice. ""It does give you your life back,"" she said of the drug. ""I literally couldn't go away from the house or very far from a bathroom, 20, 25 times in the bathroom all day long, I can't imagine living like that,"" she said, adding, ""I was becoming a hermit because I was so sick."" Humira, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of AbbVie's $25.6 billion in revenue in 2016, was not simple to develop. It is among a new class of drugs known as biologics, which are made from living cells rather than synthetic chemicals. The industry has argued that high American prices are needed to fund drug development, but a 2016 study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association found ""no evidence of an association between research and development costs and prices; rather, prescription drugs are priced in the United States primarily on the basis of what the market will bear."" Competitive pressures have been muted. Copies of biologic drugs, known as biosimilars, are not as easy to produce as normal generic drugs, and AbbVie's aggressive patent strategy has allowed it to further push off rivals. While there are name brand competitors to Humira, they are not exactly alike, complicating efforts by doctors or insurers to switch a patient from one drug to another. Looking at the international picture tells its own story about drug costs. A prefilled carton with two syringes costs $2,669 in the United States, compared with $1,362 in Britain, $822 in Switzerland and $552 in South Africa, according to a 2015 report from the International Federation of Health Plans. ""You've got the largest market for pharmaceuticals, which has the highest prices,"" said Christopher Raymond, senior biotech analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""That doesn't make any sense."" But it is typical. Other countries have single-payer systems, like Britain's National Health Service, that negotiate with drug companies or governments that exert price controls. AbbVie has put some of its earnings to work lobbying against efforts at price controls in the United States, recently in California. The industry also successfully lobbied in 2006 to bar Medicare from negotiating over drug prices. While President Trump once talked about taking action on drug prices, his administration did not follow through in the health care debate last year. By contrast, Britain's National Health Service, while strained of late, has more formidable negotiating leverage. ""I do think we need something like that in the United States, not the N.H.S. broadly, but some means of dealing with the extreme pricing instances,"" said Richard Evans, founder of SSR Health. An analysis by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review found that Humira's list price would need to be discounted by at least 55 percent to be cost effective for rheumatoid arthritis, its originally approved use. Dr. Steven D. Pearson, the founder of the institute, which provides cost benefit data to health plans, said competing drugs were overpriced as well. ""Even in a space like this, where there is a lot of competition, we don't see the prices coming down,"" he said. ""That speaks to the fact that it doesn't often function like a free market usually would."" For now, Americans have to rely on the generosity of the drug industry, such as it is. I took a spin through AbbVie's corporate Code of Conduct, entitled ""Inspired by Integrity."" It's a lofty document. ""WE ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING PATIENTS' LIVES,"" it says, in all caps. It even makes a point of saying that AbbVie supports the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That declaration, if you read it, says, ""Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care."" AbbVie joined a few of its rivals in saying it would limit price increases to single digits this year, and so only raised Humira by another 9.7 percent this month, roughly four and a half times the inflation rate. For the drug industry, that counts as generosity."
News,2018-01-06,"ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay — When she was a student in Paraguay, teachers forced her to kneel on jagged granules of salt and maize for entire mornings as punishment for speaking her mother tongue, Guaraní, in the classroom.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/world/americas/paraguay-guarani-language.html,1330," ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay — When she was a student in Paraguay, teachers forced her to kneel on jagged granules of salt and maize for entire mornings as punishment for speaking her mother tongue, Guaraní, in the classroom. ""I had to do it in front of my friends so that they saw in black and white what happens to people who speak the language,"" said Porfiria Orrego Invernizzi, now 67, and a language activist. Other students were deprived of food and water for the day, forced to wear diapers to class as a form of humiliation or simply beaten for speaking the indigenous language. Treatment of this sort existed in Paraguayan schools throughout much of the country's history, up until the fall of the dictator Alfredo Stroessner, whose 35-year rule ended in 1989. ""It was a question of open persecution,"" said David Galeano Olivera, the head of the Lyceum of Guaraní Language and Culture, which trains teachers in the language. Despite its widespread use — Paraguay is the only country in the Americas where the majority of the population speaks a single indigenous language — Guaraní has long been considered palatable for use on the streets and at home, but unsuitable in the spheres of power. Yet today, officials and intellectuals in Paraguay are working to promote a positive image of the language, in an effort to make good on the 1992 Constitution's aim to put it on equal footing with Spanish. It has been a slog. Centuries of subjugation made Guaraní a second-class language in the minds of many Paraguayans. Spanish is the dominant language in government ministries, the courts, the news media, literature, schools and professions. ""There is a stigma, a prejudice, associated with Guaraní,"" said Ladislaa Alcaraz, the government's Minister for Language Policy. ""It is associated with poverty, rurality, ignorance, with people who are illiterate."" An effort to make public education bilingual, however, has met resistance from a surprising group: Parents who were raised speaking Guaraní. Many still hold negative stereotypes of their language, and have pushed back against their children being taught in Guaraní, with its high-pitched, nasal and guttural sounds. They say that an emphasis on Spanish, or a foreign language, would make their children more competitive in the job market. ""Parents say: 'At home we speak Guaraní, so in the school they attend, I want them to learn Spanish,' "" said Nancy Benítez, a curriculum official at the Ministry of Education. ""They say: 'Let other people's kids learn it. But not mine.' "" The government is hoping to change people's perspective on the language by encouraging its use in official circles. The Ministry of Language Policy, established in 2011, has been tasked with normalizing and promoting the use of Guaraní across the government, including in the Legislature and the courts. Judicial officials are being taught Guaraní, and Paraguayans now have the right to a trial in either Spanish or Guaraní. The ministry in 2017 set up units in every government department — where less than 1 percent of written communication with the public is carried out in the language — to train civil servants in Guaraní. ""It's a human rights issue,"" Ms. Alcaraz said. ""People who use Guaraní deserve to be tended to in Guaraní."" The effort to elevate the standing of Guaraní got a lift in 2014, when the Parliament of Mercosur, the regional trading bloc, adopted it as an official working language. All this is the slowly unfurling result of a decision to make Paraguay officially bilingual in its post-dictatorship Constitution, which gave Guaraní and Spanish legal parity. The intent was to give a historically marginalized segment of the population access to basic government services, the justice system and medical care. Speaking only Guaraní ""is a significant factor driving inequality,"" said R. Andrew Nickson, an expert in Paraguayan development policy at the University of Birmingham in Britain. When it comes to having a voice on various issues, monolingual Guaraní speakers, or those who speak only a little Spanish, ""fear they will be made fun of, so prefer to keep their heads down and mouths shut,"" he added. The majority of those who speak little or no Spanish live in the countryside. One-third of Paraguayans tend to use only Guaraní at home. But this figure doubles to nearly two-thirds if urban areas are excluded. The push to improve the language's image and expand its presence is having a noticeable effect. Today, a growing number of babies and businesses are being given Guaraní names. Guaraní text can be seen on billboards and signs in Asunción, the capital. Its music is no longer just confined to the folk genre; artists are increasingly recording metal, rock and rap songs in Guaraní. Online content in Guaraní is also steadily expanding. Vikipetâ, the Guaraní version of Wikipedia, gets 220,000 monthly visitors. ""We are breaking out of the enclosure,"" said Susy Delgado, who won the 2017 national literature prize for her work in the language. ""Not as rapidly as we would like, but we are breaking out."" But efforts to bring Guaraní on an equal footing with Spanish are ""swimming against the tide,"" said Shaw N. Gynan, a linguist at Western Washington University, who has done extensive research on Guaraní. ""It is in danger,"" he said. ""And it's nothing to do with state policy."" Increasing urbanization, caused by large-scale farming that has pushed people from the countryside, is shrinking the monolingual Guaraní base. On top of this, the bilingual education program is underfunded and has failed to reach many areas of rural Paraguay, where Guaraní speakers are still schooled in Spanish, leading many to drop out. Part of the problem is that the Guaraní taught in schools is a formal, and somewhat anachronistic, version compared to the colloquial version spoken on the street. ""There is something artificial in the Guaraní kids learn in school; it isn't the Guaraní used on the street,"" Ms. Benitez said. ""It isn't the language a referee uses in a football match. It isn't the Guaraní that you're going to speak with a salesman."" There is no standardized written form of Guaraní, and there is a fierce debate about what the official version should look like. The Guaraní Language Academy, established in 2012, is split between those who favor a purer version of the language, replacing words adopted from Spanish with old Guaraní words, and those who believe it should be the heavily Spanish-influenced version, known as Yopará, that is spoken on the street. For at least one group of Paraguayans, knowledge of the language has become a key factor in their performance: politicians. In the recent past, not speaking Paraguay's native language was no barrier to those seeking to gain or stay in power. When he was dictator, Stroessner never made a single address in Guaraní (although his wife spoke the language and he rewarded rural Guaraní-speakers with land for their loyalty to his regime). But now, voters are encouraged to check if candidates speak the language, and those who do not face mockery on social media. The most recent politician to feel the repercussions was Santiago Peña, a close ally of President Horacio Cartes. In a result that surprised many, Mr. Peña failed to secure his party's nomination to contest the presidential elections in 2018, losing last month in the primary of the ruling Colorado party to Mario Abdo. One of the reasons for Mr. Peña's downfall was an elitist image painted by his opponents, aided in no small part by his inability to speak Guaraní — something Mr. Abdo did not hesitate to point out during the campaign. Under pressure from the electorate, Mr. Peña took a crash course in the language, but it appeared to have done little to sway voters. ""It wasn't like this before,"" said Maria Gloria Pereira, a policy maker and former head of curriculum at the Ministry of Education. ""Politicians feel this pressure, because they know now that those that don't speak the language of the people are far from the people."""
News,2018-01-06,"NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico — Raúl García Miranda wants Carlos Flores’s job. Mr. Flores doesn’t think he deserves it.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/business/economy/nafta-border-truckers.html,1863," NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico — Raúl García Miranda wants Carlos Flores's job. Mr. Flores doesn't think he deserves it. The two men haul goods that travel from Mexico into the United States. Both come from a Mexican border town infested with drug cartels. But Mr. Flores got out. He became a United States citizen, giving him the right to drive through the American heartland and earn good money delivering washing machines and broccoli sent from Mexico. Mr. Miranda, a Mexican national, doesn't have that option. He can make only short trips, back and forth across the border, from a lot on the southern side to truck lots 24 miles to the north. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed in 1993, the United States agreed to eventually let drivers like Mr. Miranda deposit their cargoes anywhere. Then the union representing truckers revolted, staging protests at the border and pressuring the White House to abandon the idea.  So ensued a decades-long cage match, waged by American truckers, clinging to a stronghold of blue-collar work, and their Mexican counterparts, desperate to claim territory they had been promised. In 2015, the Obama administration finally allowed Mexican drivers to seek permission to travel beyond pockets of land along the border. Only a handful now do so. But the fight has entered a new round, with an American president who has shown a special fondness for truckers and their big rigs. The Trump administration has thrown its America First agenda behind the cause in the Nafta negotiations, demanding that Mexico agree to a provision that could, in the future, block its drivers from making deliveries into the middle of the United States. Mexico has rejected that suggestion outright, challenging the fairness of shielding a slice of laborers from low-paid foreign competitors, in a trade deal meant to allow most everything to flow freely across borders. The dispute offers a window into the stakes involved in rewriting, or blowing up, an agreement that has become highly contentious but also extremely lucrative for all sides. It also hints at the impact that market forces — more than rules agreed to on paper — may have on the ways two nations exchange wares. More than $525 billion in goods travel between the United States and Mexico in a year, and most come on trucks. The tension over who gets to profit off that flow can be boiled down to the handoff, from a Mexican to an American, of 64 refrigerators destined for Texas. The journey began on a recent Thursday at a lot in northern Mexico, distinguished by a taco truck and not much else. A group of drivers, all men, formed a line outside a dispatch window at Fema, one of Mexico's largest trucking companies, waiting to find out what they'd be lugging into America. Someone else had brought the trailer filled with LG refrigerators to this spot. Mr. Miranda's job was to take them across the border to a lot in Laredo. He travels this route multiple times a day. The work is rote, but never-ending. Mr. Miranda works up to 18 hours a day, six days a week. ""I lost my family because of this work,"" Mr. Miranda said. He is 36, with a thinning hairline, but could pass for a teenager when he smiles. He has the plaintive look of a man who has spent years appeasing heavily armed men at border checkpoints. This town, Nuevo Laredo, sits just below Texas and right above an area in central Mexico that foreign car and aircraft makers transformed into an international manufacturing hub over the last 30 years.  As trade between Mexico and the United States exploded in the wake of Nafta, new career paths emerged for men like Mr. Miranda. When he took the job, his idea was to pay off the loan on his house and save up enough to send his young son to school. As it turned out, his job took him away from home so much that his wife asked for a separation a few months after he started. His family lives in town, but he worries about how his son is handling growing up in a home with only one parent. ""I didn't think it would be such a sacrifice,"" Mr. Miranda said. Each time he crosses the border, the trucking company pays him around $12, he said. On a good day, he can make the trip four times. When traffic piles up, he can go only once. The line that Mr. Miranda endures on his way into the United States can last more than three hours. A red light flashed as he passed through the border. ""Bad news,"" he said. He had been randomly picked for an inspection at the Customs and Border Protection checkpoint. Normally, even after the border wait, the inspection alone takes three hours. Drivers waiting their turn sprawl out on spartan benches and tables, blistering in the heat. While agents in an air-conditioned office pored over an ultrasound of the inside of his truck, and riffled through his documents, Mr. Miranda stood and watched. The conversation eventually turned to President Trump, for whom Mr. Miranda has a measure of respect. ""He has good things and bad things,"" he said. ""He's protecting his country on the one hand, but he's also making relations bad."" Mr. Miranda got the clearance to head north. He set off on a 20-minute drive to Werner Enterprises, a giant in American freight. When he arrived at the terminal, a pristine repository for shiny blue tractors, he backed his 53-foot trailer ever so gently into an open slot, unhooked his cab and drove off. He dreams of trucking across Texas, through Oklahoma, all the way to Michigan. His weekly pay, he reckons, would triple. ""We are all waiting for a deal where we can drive into the U.S.,"" he said. ""There's a lot of hope."" It might seem more efficient to hire Mr. Miranda to take the refrigerators directly to their final destination. For 20 years, though, the Teamsters union persuaded lawmakers to stop Mexican trucks from driving beyond parcels of land that hug the border from California to Texas. The union and its ally, an association for independent drivers, argued that Mexican truckers would cause fatal accidents, pollute the air with old big rigs and steal jobs from Americans. When President Barack Obama ended the moratorium in 2015, almost nothing changed. Only 38 Mexican carriers were authorized to make deliveries past the border zone, with fewer than 500 drivers — Mr. Miranda not among them. By comparison, more than 30,000 Americans haul Nafta goods from Mexico and Canada. Derek J. Leathers, the chief executive of Werner Enterprises, said there was little appetite among Mexican trucking companies. ""Mexican carriers by and large do not have a burning desire for their trucks and drivers to deliver into the U.S.,"" he said. ""It's a special environment with special expertise required."" Insurance providers charge Mexican carriers higher rates, as they do with any driver lacking a track record on American roads, trucking officials say. There is a constellation of American rules and regulations that don't exist in Mexico. The truckers have to speak some English. And there often isn't anything for Mexican drivers to take back after they drop their trailers off. The United States buys more from Mexican companies than it sells to them. Like foreign airlines, Mexican truckers can't take things between two American locations; they can only go in and out. Returning with an empty trailer means there's probably no shipper paying for that leg of the journey. The fight to keep Mexicans out by law is senseless, Mr. Leathers said, because the market is already weighted against them. ""It's a whole lot of debate and a whole lot of political rhetoric around something that neither side has an interest in doing,"" he said. That hasn't convinced American truckers or their advocates, who have seen what happened to factory jobs and refuse to trust politicians or executives who tell them that all will be well. All the economic obstacles standing in the way of an onslaught of Mexican drivers can be overcome with enough money, they say. ""I could see some private equity group saying: 'Let's buy a trucking company. Let's exploit Nafta,'"" said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon. ""'We are going to enhance the value of this asset by firing all the American workers and replacing them with $2.50-an-hour Mexican drivers.'"" At Werner Enterprises, Mr. Flores hopped into his tractor as soon as he got the word from his bosses. He wove his way through the parking lot, stopping at the trailer that Mr. Miranda had just abandoned and linking it to his cab. He was heading for San Antonio, with the sun setting and spilling blood orange onto the horizon. Mr. Flores's truck blared with an alarm that he couldn't turn off. He turned up the classic rock on the radio to drown out the sound. ""I don't think that's cool that those guys can just come with no papers,"" Mr. Flores said. ""They don't have to pay for training. They don't have to pay for citizenship like me. They come over here and are laughing at us. It's unfair."" When Mr. Flores started driving for Werner, as an employee, he worked himself to the ground and earned a fat paycheck. He spent three weeks on the road, driving from Texas to Canada and back, sleeping at truck stops in between. He would then return for a weekend in Brownsville, Tex., to see his wife and children. Then one day, his 7-year-old daughter's legs swelled up and she stopped walking. A specialist in Houston diagnosed angioedema, an uncurable disease involving swelling of deep layers of skin. Mr. Flores decided to take on a shorter route so that he could spend more time at home. ""When something like that happens, you don't care about making money,"" he said. Now 55, he lives with his family in San Antonio and works as an owner-operator, meaning he bought his truck but has to cover the hefty cost of maintaining it. He doesn't have a personal beef with the trucker who brought the trailer here, he said. Mr. Flores has never met Mr. Miranda, but he, too, was born in Nuevo Laredo. In 1991, he moved to Brownsville and got married. He and his wife earned money by baking and selling traditional Mexican cakes outside offices. It took him a decade to get his citizenship and cost $1,000 for lawyers and fees. It may sound strange that an immigrant like him wants to keep Mexicans off his route. But Mr. Flores sees himself as an American who earned the right to this work. One in every five people in the business of transportation is an immigrant, according to the Pew Research Center. ""Those guys just want to come here, make their money and go home,"" Mr. Flores said. ""I spend my money here. I bought my house. I pay my taxes."" With that, Mr. Flores pulled up to the final checkpoint these refrigerators would pass through that day before winding up in San Antonio. It is the line that Mexican drivers can't cross without a permit — the end of the border zone. An officer held a hand up. ""American citizens?"" The question barely lingered. ""Yes,"" Mr. Flores said, before maneuvering his truck onto the highway, on his way home."
Question,2018-01-06,"The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/reader-center/marijuana-laws.html,1727," The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, long a vocal opponent of the legalization of marijuana, rescinded on Thursday an Obama-era policy that discouraged federal prosecution of marijuana-related crimes in states that had legalized the drug. The announcement came just days after the first retail cannabis shops opened in California, the sixth state to legalize recreational marijuana use. As the tug of war between state and federal authorities continues, we asked readers for their questions about marijuana policy. Two of our reporters — Thomas Fuller, our San Francisco bureau chief, and Charlie Savage, a Washington correspondent — answered some of the 700 questions we received. The questions have been condensed and edited for clarity. What is the federal policy? How will it affect state legalization movements?   What do the federal laws against marijuana actually say? — Rick Goldberg In the Controlled Substances Act, Congress made it generally illegal ""to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance."" There are a range of criminal penalties and restrictions depending on factors like the quantity involved, and how the government has categorized that substance. For years, advocates of cannabis legalization have unsuccessfully urged the federal government to remove marijuana from its Schedule I listing — the category of drugs deemed to be the most potentially harmful and addictive and to lack medicinal value. Others in that category include heroin. — Charlie Savage Are federal prosecutors free to ignore this? I see the word ""discretion"" in every article — presumably they can use their discretion to pursue other things instead. Is this at all likely? — David Dyte, Brooklyn, N.Y. In theory, United States attorneys in federal districts around the country have discretion to continue to focus their resources elsewhere and to not bring marijuana cases. It remains to be seen how President Trump's Justice Department will handle the new policy in practice. — Charlie Savage What is California's policy? Will it be enforced statewide? What are the top differences in California law versus federal law? — Jessica, New Jersey This is an issue in which federal law and state law are completely at odds. The federal government considers marijuana a drug with high potential for abuse and no medicinal value. It puts marijuana in the same category as heroin under the Controlled Substances Act. California, by contrast, made marijuana legal for medical purposes in 1996. And on New Year's Day the sale of recreational marijuana became legal. So there is zero common ground between federal and state law. — Thomas Fuller Doesn't federal law supersede California state law? — Warren N. Miller, Boise, Idaho Both essentially exist in parallel. State statutes govern what sorts of crimes local and state law enforcement officials — like city police and district attorneys — can arrest and prosecute people for, while federal statutes govern the same for federal agents and United States attorneys. In practice, marijuana crimes have largely been handled at the state level. — Charlie Savage Can individual cities in California refuse to allow marijuana dispensaries to operate? And will cities see any of the tax revenue from sales? What specific actions will California take to oppose Mr. Sessions's marijuana stance? — Marissa Pinching, Long Beach, Calif. California law gives cities and counties wide latitude on marijuana regulations. The Board of Supervisors in Kern County voted in October to ban any marijuana-related activity, both cultivation and sale. Cities and counties that do allow marijuana businesses get a share of the tax revenue generated from local sales. — Thomas Fuller What form of ID is generally required to purchase recreational marijuana (specifically in California)? I have read that state driver's licenses are standard. But what about out-of-state visitors, foreigners, etc.? — Chris Larson, Switzerland I reached out to Daniel Yi, the head of communications at MedMen, a company with a chain of dispensaries in Southern California. He said they accept ""any official government issued photo ID, including foreign passports."" — Thomas Fuller What do Congress, the Supreme Court and the IRS have to say about it?  How much tax revenue could be generated if the federal government legalized the sale of marijuana nationwide? — Kevin Atkins, Jackson, Tenn. Let's start with Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana sales. Cannabis tax revenues are well above the state's initial estimates and now exceed alcohol tax receipts. The Colorado Department of Revenue recorded almost $194 million in taxes from cannabis sales in 2016. Alcohol taxes brought in a fraction of that, $44 million, according to the department's annual report. Cannabis also brought in more in tax revenue than cigarette taxes, at $162 million. How does this translate to a national level? The Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank, calculated in a 2016 report that legalization could generate up to $28 billion in taxes at the federal, state and local levels. Their calculation for federal revenues is $7 billion. But all of this seems somewhat pie-in-the-sky; the more aggressive stance toward the drug by Mr. Sessions indicates that national legalization is not coming anytime soon. — Thomas Fuller What does research say about the benefit and harm of marijuana use? As far as I know, tobacco and alcohol may be far more harmful. Is the alcohol and tobacco industry paying politicians to not legalize marijuana because it could potentially be a competitor? Does the industrial-prison complex have anything to do with this? — Tom Tim, Chicago There's a Catch-22 here. Determining a drug's efficacy requires a well-established system of clinical trials. But research on marijuana has been very limited in the United States because the federal government considers cannabis dangerous and of no medical value. Opinions on the health effects of cannabis can be quite polarized. A study in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry found that marijuana was more addictive than alcohol but less than tobacco. Some experts believe that legalization is inevitable but that marijuana should be treated more like tobacco than alcohol — in other words, people should be encouraged to stop using the drug. Marijuana proponents point out that we hear a lot about people dying from opioid and alcohol abuse, including those who die in alcohol-related car crashes, but we don't hear such things about marijuana. Last year, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine took a stab at answering the big questions about marijuana and health. It released a study that said there is conclusive evidence that marijuana helped in the treatment of chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and muscle spasms related to multiple sclerosis. There was moderate evidence that it helped people with insomnia. The dangers? There was substantial evidence, the report said, of a link between pregnant women smoking marijuana and lower birth weights. The report said driving under the influence of cannabis is dangerous and that there was moderate evidence of a correlation between cannabis and ""impairment in the cognitive domains of learning, memory, and attention."" The report's first recommendation: We need more research. — Thomas Fuller How much do you estimate that California will collect in terms of tax revenue directly from the sale of recreational marijuana in California? — Harry Solomon, Naples, Fla. Cannabis customers in Oakland are paying around 38 percent tax on their purchases. In San Jose it's around 35 percent. So a large chunk of legal marijuana sales are going into state coffers. In November 2016, when voters passed Proposition 64, the ballot initiative that legalized recreational marijuana, they were told that legalization would provide tax revenues ""ranging from high hundreds of millions of dollars to over $1 billion annually."" The ballot summary also said legalization would reduce criminal justice costs by tens of millions of dollars a year. It's too early to say whether these estimates were accurate. Only around 100 dispensaries were open in California on New Year's Day but many more are expected to open in the coming weeks and months. One of the first measures of tax revenues will come in May when the California Board of Equalization will release data on first-quarter cannabis collection. Stay tuned. — Thomas Fuller How will California's new law affect the environment and the state's small cannabis growers?  I read an article about detrimental effects to the environment from cannabis cultivation, especially damage to public lands and wildlife in California. Will legalization (and regulation) improve the situation? — David Warren, Roswell, Ga. The environmental effects have been severe in some parts of the state. A study published in 2015 by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife determined that marijuana gardens had depleted a number of creeks and streams during the dry season, imperiling salmon and trout in the waterways. The study relied on satellite images of marijuana gardens in the remote areas of Mendocino and Humboldt Counties. Marijuana is a thirsty plant, consuming as much as six gallons of water a day, about twice as much as wine grapes. Will legalization improve the situation? That's an open question. Growers who become part of the legalized system must abide by strict environmental regulations. But only around 10 percent of growers have signed up to join the system so far according to Hezekiah Allen, the executive director of the California Growers Association. The big question for California regulators is what they are going to do about the 90 percent who continue to grow in the black market. — Thomas Fuller What effects will California's decision to allow large corporate interests to participate in the marijuana markets have on smaller organizations and individuals just getting started in the business? — Richard Buford, Santa Barbara, Calif. This is a major concern for small-scale cannabis cultivators of marijuana in California. When Proposition 64 passed there was a moratorium on large-scale farming. But California's Department of Food and Agriculture removed those limits in November, leading to predictions of a consolidation of the industry. Critics say the cannabis industry in California, which for decades was made up of mostly small growers, could end up looking like the alcohol or tobacco industries. On the other hand, the continued federal ban of the drug could discourage large, publicly traded companies from taking part in the industry. — Thomas Fuller"
News,2018-01-06,"Diane Butrus, a business executive from St. Louis, wandered the streets of Zurich, looking for a bank that would help her keep $1.5 million hidden from America tax collectors.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/business/stefan-buck-tax-evasion.html,2878," Diane Butrus, a business executive from St. Louis, wandered the streets of Zurich, looking for a bank that would help her keep $1.5 million hidden from America tax collectors. One bank after another turned her down on that afternoon in 2009. They were worried about a United States crackdown on tax evasion and were no longer willing to shelter American money. Finally, across the street from a city park, up a discreet elevator, seated in a luxurious conference room, Ms. Butrus found a banker ready to help. His name was Stefan Buck. Mr. Buck said that his employer, Bank Frey, would be happy to take Ms. Butrus's money, according to court documents and interviews with Mr. Buck and Ms. Butrus. He instructed her to wire the $1.5 million to Bank Frey. He told her that her name wouldn't be attached to the new account. It would be known internally as Cardinal, an alias she chose in a nod to her favorite baseball team. After that, Ms. Butrus contacted Mr. Buck via prepaid cellphones she picked up at a Walgreens drugstore. Every six months or so, she flew to Zurich to withdraw money directly from Mr. Buck. She would return to the United States secretly carrying just under $10,000 in cash — the cutoff for having to make a customs declaration. The setup allowed Ms. Butrus to avoid paying tens of thousands of dollars in income taxes. And it wouldn't have been possible without Mr. Buck and Bank Frey. As much as chocolate and watches, Switzerland is known for bank secrecy. That made the country a destination for money that the wealthy wanted to hide. Last decade, it also made Swiss banks targets for an assault by the United States government, which was tired of Americans escaping taxes on money in offshore accounts. Many banks came clean, divulging their clients to American authorities. Many Americans, including Ms. Butrus, searched for new places to park their money. Bank Frey was among the very few to defy the legal onslaught. And Mr. Buck, a clean-cut and self-confident 28-year-old at the time he met Ms. Butrus, was the bank's public face, responsible for landing and then managing American accounts. That put Mr. Buck in the government's cross hairs. In 2013, a federal grand jury indicted him for conspiring to help Americans avoid taxes. It seemed like another blow against Swiss bank secrecy. But things didn't go as prosecutors had planned — and the chain of events could have big consequences for America's fight to keep people from evading taxes using offshore bank accounts. Mr. Buck was raised in Germany. His parents had been championship ice dancers; his mother competed in figure skating for Switzerland in the 1972 Olympics in Japan. His father ran an insurance company, and Mr. Buck figured that one day he would take it over. But an acquaintance from business school offered him a job in early 2007 at Bank Frey. The bank was tiny, with about 20 employees. Mr. Buck shared an office with four people, including the bank's receptionist. ""We all got along well,"" he said. The business revolved around clients that the bank's founder, Markus Frey, had accumulated over the years, according to Mr. Buck and the court testimony of another former bank employee. At first, there wasn't a focus on Americans. Then, in 2008, a legal earthquake shook the foundations of Swiss banking. American prosecutors started filing criminal charges against bankers and executives who had set up accounts for Americans. In 2009, UBS, the huge Swiss bank, admitted helping Americans hide money from the Internal Revenue Service and agreed to provide authorities with the names of its tax-dodging clients. Soon Swiss banks were expelling American clients. Not Bank Frey. It didn't have offices in the United States, and executives didn't see it as their responsibility to police whether their clients were paying taxes. ""We decided there's no reason not to maintain business with American clients,"" Mr. Buck said in an interview. Executives consulted with legal experts to ensure they weren't crossing any lines. ""We really tried to make sure that how we did the business is correct."" Opening accounts for desperate Americans seemed like a golden opportunity. ""The positioning of Bank Frey as a solely Swiss private bank is now considered as a competitive advantage by the market,"" the bank's chief executive, Gregor Bienz, said at a board meeting in late 2008, according to records of the meeting. Mr. Bienz didn't respond to requests for comment. Over the next few years, hundreds of millions of dollars in American deposits flowed from Swiss banking stalwarts — institutions like Credit Suisse and Julius Baer — to Bank Frey. Its number of American clients roughly tripled, according to court records. By September 2012, nearly half of the bank's $2.1 billion in assets was held on behalf of American taxpayers. Ms. Butrus was one of them. C. Richard Lucy, a former Goldman Sachs and Bank of America executive in New York, was another. In late 2009, Mr. Lucy's contact at Julius Baer, where he'd had an account for many years, told him he had to move it elsewhere. Mr. Lucy traveled to Zurich and met with about 15 banks. None would take his money, according to his court testimony. There was one exception. ""A couple of times the name Bank Frey came up as a bank that was new and aggressively seeking out accounts,"" he testified. (He didn't respond to requests for comment.) Sure enough, when Mr. Lucy showed up at Bank Frey's offices, Mr. Buck said he would open him an account. Mr. Lucy was impressed by Mr. Buck's assurances that his bank had nothing to worry about in the American tax-evasion investigations. ""I had found what I was looking for,"" Mr. Lucy said. Mr. Lucy said that Mr. Buck arranged for him to get a Matterhorn-emblazoned debit card that didn't have Bank Frey's or Mr. Lucy's names on it. Mr. Lucy was told that, when he needed money, he should call Bank Frey and ask them to load money onto the debit card. He could use it at any ATM. Mr. Lucy wanted to bring some account documentation back to New York. He said Mr. Buck advised him not to take anything with Bank Frey's name on it. (Mr. Buck denies giving that advice.) Mr. Lucy took a pair of scissors and snipped Bank Frey's name and logo off the paperwork. Back in Manhattan, Mr. Lucy bought a prepaid phone card for his calls to Zurich. He made them from a pay phone outside his apartment building. When that phone was damaged, the only other functioning pay phone he could find nearby was inside the kitchen of a boutique hotel. Surrounded by the kitchen's hubbub, he chatted on the phone with his Swiss banker. By the turn of the decade, other Swiss banks were booting their American customers — and handing them glossy Bank Frey brochures on the way out the door. Mr. Buck, who eventually rose to be Bank Frey's head of private banking, said he felt he wasn't doing anything wrong. All the same, he warned one client, Christine Warsaw, against sending banking instructions through the United States Postal Service, she said in court. ""No USPS, use fax,"" she wrote in a note to herself. Mr. Buck said he didn't tell her not to send materials through the mail. By 2011, it was dangerous for Americans to keep their money in undeclared offshore accounts. More banks were handing over client lists to the Justice Department. If you showed up on a list, prosecutors might pursue you. A safer option was to turn yourself in to the I.R.S. through a voluntary self-disclosure program. It allowed taxpayers to pay back taxes, cooperate with investigators and move on with their lives. Ms. Butrus closed her Bank Frey account and eventually declared the money to the I.R.S. She paid her taxes and a stiff penalty and pledged to help the I.R.S. and prosecutors. Mr. Lucy did, too. On disclosure forms, both identified Mr. Buck as their relationship manager. Prosecutors were hunting for bankers to hold accountable. The theory was that bankers knew they were enabling Americans to break the law and therefore were part of a conspiracy to defraud the United States government. Prosecutors turned to people including Ms. Butrus and Mr. Lucy. By 2013, more than 20 employees of Swiss financial institutions had been criminally charged. At least a dozen pleaded guilty and received a fine, probation or both. Several hunkered down in Switzerland, which refused to extradite its citizens to the United States for actions that weren't illegal in Switzerland. None had actually gone on trial. At 5 o'clock one morning in April 2013, Mr. Buck was awakened by a phone call. Bank Frey's chief executive was on the line. ""Go look at Bloomberg,"" Mr. Buck recalls him saying, referring to the business-news service. ""I'm sleeping,"" Mr. Buck said he replied. ""Do it now,"" his boss ordered. Mr. Buck pulled out his cellphone. There it was: an article saying he had been indicted. Terrified, Mr. Buck skimmed the indictment. The indictment made clear that his former clients were assisting the government. ""It was surreal,"" Mr. Buck said. Mr. Buck, 32 years old at the time and single, went to work to hand in his I.D. card and cellphone. He was placed on paid leave; the bank would cover his legal expenses. Then Mr. Buck headed to his sister's house. It was her husband's birthday, and they were hosting a barbecue. His sister, Sylvia Muther, was nearly nine months pregnant. ""We were scared he'd go to jail,"" she said. ""We tried not to think about that."" ""I got hammered,"" Mr. Buck said. Mr. Buck spent months weighing his options. He could plead guilty and be done with it. He could spend the rest of his life in Switzerland, which wouldn't extradite him. Or he could fight the charges. That third road was perilous. If Mr. Buck won at trial, he would be free — and the Justice Department's fight against bankers who enable tax evasion would be dealt a serious blow. If he lost, he was looking at up to five years in prison. In October 2014, one of UBS's top executives, Raoul Weil, went on trial in Florida. Federal prosecutors accused him of helping clients hide billions. Mr. Weil's lawyers argued he had no knowledge of or responsibility for what had happened. The jury deliberated for barely an hour before acquitting him. The same week, a Los Angeles jury acquitted an Israeli banker who faced similar accusations. The Americans' pursuit of foreign bankers no longer looked invincible. A few months later, on a cloudy morning in January 2015, Mr. Buck was skiing with friends in the Swiss Alps. Above the tree line, they started their descent. A sign on the slope marked the boundary between France and Switzerland. Mr. Buck realized he was crossing an international border — and that meant he theoretically could be picked up on an American arrest warrant in France. ""I was scared,"" Mr. Buck said. He told his friends to continue without him. He snapped off his skis, trudged back up the slope and skied down the Swiss side of the mountain. Mr. Buck realized he couldn't spend the rest of his life fearful of crossing a border. ""There was no way I was just going to stay in Switzerland,"" he said. Mr. Buck told his lawyer, Marc A. Agnifilo, that he wanted his day in court. On Nov. 9, 2016, Mr. Buck boarded a flight to New York. He had spent the previous two nights too scared to sleep. Mr. Agnifilo had negotiated with Manhattan prosecutors to let Mr. Buck out on bail once he arrived. The catch was that he would have to stay in the United States, with his passport confiscated, until his trial. ""Do you have any idea when I'm going to come back?"" he asked Mr. Agnifilo. ""No,"" his lawyer responded. ""Hopefully you don't have a cat you need to feed."" An I.R.S. agent collected Mr. Buck as he exited the plane in New York. He was fingerprinted, photographed, shackled and driven to a prison next to the Brooklyn Bridge. He spent the night with a cellmate whose hedge fund had been raided that morning by agents with machine guns. The next day, Mr. Buck pleaded not guilty and was released on bail. He moved into an Upper East Side apartment, paid for by Bank Frey, which by then had ceased operations, its business model seemingly up in smoke. It would be months before his trial was scheduled. Mr. Buck made the most of the free time. He trained in Central Park for the New York City Marathon. He became a Yankees fan. For New Year's, he went to Miami with friends. Since he had no I.D., he couldn't fly; instead he spent 33 hours on a Greyhound. ""He sees it all as an adventure,"" Mr. Agnifilo said. He spent much of his time in Mr. Agnifilo's 26th-floor law offices, helping his lawyers translate German-language documents. The crux of the defense was that the responsibility to pay taxes and declare income did not rest with Mr. Buck. It was his clients who had decided not to pay taxes. He was under no obligation to tattle; in fact, he was prohibited from doing so by Swiss bank-secrecy laws. Trial preparations dragged on, partly because Mr. Agnifilo also was representing Martin Shkreli, the hedge fund manager who eventually would be convicted of fraud. Mr. Buck had heard of Mr. Shkreli. He hadn't realized they would be sharing a lawyer. Mr. Agnifilo and Mr. Buck both recall shouting matches over whether the lawyer was sufficiently devoted to his client's case. Mr. Buck's trial started in October. Prosecutors branded him as a crucial cog in an international tax-evasion scheme. Mr. Agnifilo decided that Mr. Buck shouldn't testify. While the defendant was confident of his innocence, the cross-examination promised to be brutal. And Mr. Buck's English was imperfect. Jurors heard from a parade of Mr. Buck's former clients, including Ms. Butrus and Mr. Lucy. They testified that Mr. Buck and Bank Frey had been instrumental in allowing them to dodge taxes. ""We didn't want anyone, specifically the I.R.S., to find out we had an account at the time,"" Ms. Butrus testified. Prosecutors said all the secrecy — the nameless debit cards, the scissored bank paperwork, the shadowy phone calls — showed Mr. Buck knew what he was doing was wrong. ""These are techniques used by a person who is trying to keep from getting caught, not by a person who thinks he's operating legally,"" said Sarah E. Paul, an assistant United States attorney, near the end of the trial. Then it was Mr. Agnifilo's turn. ""At the center of the crime scene, there is an American with a pen,"" he intoned. ""Stefan Buck has nothing whatsoever, nothing whatsoever, to do with the choice that an American taxpayer makes"" to not declare offshore assets. Mr. Agnifilo said the fact that Mr. Buck came to America, rather than staying in Switzerland, confirmed that he had nothing to hide. ""Let Mr. Buck go back to Switzerland,"" he finished. It was a moving performance. ""I'm close to crying the first time in 25 years,"" Mr. Buck wrote on a Post-it note he handed his lawyers. The judge, Jed S. Rakoff, also was impressed. ""I knew you were a powerful orator,"" he told Mr. Agnifilo after the jury left, ""but you have exceeded all bounds."" The jury deliberated for a little more than a day. On Nov. 21, Mr. Buck was sitting on a toilet in the courthouse bathroom when the verdict came in. He hustled to the courtroom. A pair of United States Marshals hovered at the back. ""Are they here for me?"" Mr. Buck recalled asking his lawyer. No, Mr. Agnifilo fibbed. He knew the marshals were there to take Mr. Buck into custody if he was found guilty. The jury filed in and delivered the verdict: not guilty. Afterward, Mr. Buck spoke to the jurors in the hallway — the first time they had heard his voice. ""Happy Thanksgiving,"" he told them. Mr. Buck's acquittal reverberated through the legal community. The Justice Department had now lost the three cases it had tried against foreign bankers who helped Americans avoid taxes. Dozens more cases are pending. Those who represent accused Swiss bankers say they expect Mr. Buck's verdict to embolden defendants and to cause prosecutors to think twice before bringing new charges. ""It should change their calculus,"" said Marc S. Harris, a lawyer at Scheper Kim & Harris, who successfully defended the Israeli banker in 2014. He said the cases represented a ""misguided effort"" by the Justice Department to respond to political pressure to prosecute bankers. In early December, Mr. Buck's family and friends greeted him at the Zurich airport with a giant welcome-home poster. His priority was to get to the Alps for peak ski season. ""The timing of my return is perfect,"" he said. He hopes to get back to work soon in the Swiss finance industry."
News,2018-01-06,WASHINGTON — They cannot agree on subsidies for low-income people under the Affordable Care Act or even how to extend funding for the broadly popular Children’s Health Insurance Program — two issues requiring urgent attention as Congress returns to work.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/us/politics/congress-medical-research-health-care.html,1365," WASHINGTON — They cannot agree on subsidies for low-income people under the Affordable Care Act or even how to extend funding for the broadly popular Children's Health Insurance Program — two issues requiring urgent attention as Congress returns to work. But a more exotic corner of the medical world has drawn rapturous agreement among Republicans and Democrats: the development of new treatments and cures through taxpayer-funded biomedical research. For the third straight year, lawmakers are planning to increase the budget of the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion. In the process, they have summarily rejected cuts proposed by President Trump. The push for additional funding reflects a fascination among legislators with advances in fields like molecular biology, genetics and regenerative medicine, even as they wage bitter battles over just how large a role the government should play in financing health care and providing coverage. At a recent hearing, Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Tim Scott of South Carolina, both Republicans, and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, a Democrat, pressed scientists to explain exactly how gene editing technology could lead to new treatments for sickle cell anemia, H.I.V., cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's and other diseases. Ms. Hassan wanted to know the relative merits of different techniques for editing DNA and RNA — what she called ""this incredible cutting-edge technology."" Why is medical research so much less contentious than fundamental issues like health insurance coverage? Anthony J. Mazzaschi, a lobbyist at the national organization representing schools of public health, said that ""the charisma of the cure, the hope and promise of curing disease, seems to excite members of Congress,"" including some in their 70s and 80s who are ""facing the prospect of disease and disability head-on."" And that prospect is bipartisan. ""Disease doesn't impact just Republicans or Democrats,"" said Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado. ""It impacts everybody."" While the search for new treatments and cures is advancing at breakneck speed, ideas about how to help patients pay for them lag far behind. And Republicans who sometimes laud the N.I.H. as the National Institutes of Hope also support dismantling the Affordable Care Act, which could limit access to the new treatments. ""If we are spending billions to incentivize the development of new drugs, I think we also have to ensure that patients can afford those drugs,"" said Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois. ""It is almost cruel to find a cure and then have it priced so high that a patient can't afford it."" The challenges facing patients and policymakers were illustrated this past week when a Philadelphia company said it would charge $850,000 for a new gene therapy to treat a rare inherited form of blindness. (The company, Spark Therapeutics, said it would pay rebates to certain insurers if the medicine, given in a one-time injection, did not work as promised.) Members of Congress have friends, relatives and constituents who suffer from cancer, Alzheimer's and other diseases, but lawmakers may have less interaction with people who are uninsured and unable to afford doctor visits or prescription drugs. ""Sadly,"" said R. Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, ""the cynic in me says it's because of the prevalence of selfishness. We all want to know there's something out there that will cure us if we need it, but many of us are quite reluctant to pay for somebody else to get cured when they need it."" Sherri J. Bale, a geneticist who worked at the N.I.H. for 16 years before founding GeneDx, a genetic testing company in Gaithersburg, Md., said: ""Gene therapy has fabulous promise. We will soon be able to treat and even cure people with genetic diseases where we previously had nothing at all to offer them. But where are they supposed to get the money to pay for these treatments — thousands of dollars a month?"" ""What good is the research if all you do is treat people in a clinical trial and publish a few papers?"" Ms. Bale asked. ""I'm afraid that patients will be left in the lurch."" With huge bipartisan majorities, Congress in 2016 passed the 21st Century Cures Act, to speed the discovery of cures and the approval of new drugs and medical devices. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, called it ""the most significant legislation"" passed by Congress in 2015-16. Nine-year-old Max Schill of Williamstown, N.J., who has a rare genetic condition known as Noonan syndrome, which causes heart defects and growth delays, was the public face of patients who could benefit from that legislation. ""Max bravely visited nearly every senator's office with handmade drawings asking for support,"" said Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey. But while a few children with rare diseases can sometimes elicit an outpouring of concern, millions of Americans continue to lack health insurance. A month after President Barack Obama signed the medical cures bill in December 2016, surrounded by members of both parties, Republicans in Congress ramped up their campaign to demolish the Affordable Care Act — a law that Mr. McConnell once described as ""the single worst piece of legislation that has been passed in the last half-century."" Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration appear uncertain whether they want to repeal what remains of the Affordable Care Act or stabilize insurance marketplaces created by the law. They cannot agree among themselves, much less with Democrats, over the future direction of federal health policy. Funds for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which serves nearly nine million children, and for community health centers, which serve more than 24 million patients, are in limbo because of inaction by Congress. The partisan divide was evident last week when Mr. Trump proposed to relax certain health insurance rules. Senator Alexander and other Republicans hailed the move as a way to reduce costs for 11 million small-business employees and self-employed people. But the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, said the president's proposal was a recipe for ""junk health insurance"" that would strip consumers of vital protections provided by the Affordable Care Act. Bipartisan Senate efforts to stabilize insurance markets face long odds in the House. Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the Senate health committee, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the panel, drafted a bill to continue paying cost-sharing subsidies to insurance companies on behalf of low-income people. But their bill met fierce resistance from conservative House Republicans, who said it would prop up the health law and bail out insurers. By contrast, the appeal of biomedical research often appears to transcend politics. In a decision applauded by scientists, Mr. Trump decided to retain the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis S. Collins, who led the government's 15-year effort to map the human genome and inspires lawmakers with his infectious enthusiasm for medical research. When Dr. Collins and Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, appeared at House and Senate hearings to assess progress under the Cures Act, one theme ran through questions from members of both parties: What more can we do to help you? The N.I.H. has an annual budget of roughly $34 billion, and over 80 percent of it goes out in grants to more than 300,000 scientists at universities, medical schools and other research institutions that can lobby local members of Congress. Dr. Matthew H. Porteus, a pediatrician and stem cell biologist at Stanford University who testified at the Senate hearing on gene editing, said he was impressed with the level of congressional interest and surprised at the lack of partisanship. ""The senators' questions were spoken as if they were experts,"" he said. ""If you didn't know what party each senator belonged to, you'd have no idea, based on the questions they asked."" At the same time, Dr. Porteus said, ""it's really disappointing"" that Congress has been unable to find money for a long-term extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program. ""If you can't provide the best possible care for people today, and CHIP is an essential part of that for millions of children,"" Dr. Porteus said, ""you'll be in a poor position to provide advanced care to people in the future."""

News,2018-01-07,"ROME — For generations of Romans, Epiphany, not Christmas, was the holiday season’s main day for receiving gifts. They are dispensed overnight, according to Italian folklore, by the Befana, a broom-riding old hag with a strict naughty-or-nice ethic. To fall on her wrong side was to wake up on Jan. 6 to a stocking full of coal.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/world/europe/italy-befana-piazza-navona.html,1279," ROME — For generations of Romans, Epiphany, not Christmas, was the holiday season's main day for receiving gifts. They are dispensed overnight, according to Italian folklore, by the Befana, a broom-riding old hag with a strict naughty-or-nice ethic. To fall on her wrong side was to wake up on Jan. 6 to a stocking full of coal. The Befana's traditional headquarters — a kiosk-filled market in the central Piazza Navona here where vendors hawk trinkets, toys and sticky sweets — was a beloved annual pilgrimage, a kid-magnet of excitement, fun and sugar highs. This year, Roman families turned out as usual, many with strollers in tow, on a sunny and warm Saturday. But it was evident that times had changed, and a cloud hung over the market. Concerns about terrorism had choked off the event, and as lines formed at the entrances to the elegant Baroque square, police and carabinieri officers stood at steel barriers. Agents wielding metal detectors scanned knapsacks under the startled gaze of wide-eyed children. Earlier in the week, the square had been placed under ""special surveillance."" Truth be told, the Befana market had been in a slump for several years. Three years ago, vendors and city officials clashed over the dwindling quality of the market and accusations of favoritism that effectively exiled commercial booths from the square. They returned this past year, but the authorities drastically reduced their number and toughened the requirements for concession stands. Bitter squabbles with the city authorities over the additional security measures — and who would foot the bill — had also delayed the opening for weeks, causing some vendors who had snapped up some of the 50-odd licenses available to opt out. Even though the sun was shining, Paolo Padovani, whose crèche figurine kiosk has been a Piazza Navona staple since 1926, was gloomy. ""It's been a disaster,"" he said. Usually, the market opens at the beginning of December. This season, the stands were not up and running until Dec. 19, ""when most people have already put up their Nativity scenes,"" he said. Sales plummeted, he said, because ""people got fed up with waiting."" Donato Colangelo, a greeter at one of the restaurants that line the graceful square, said this past week: ""It's a sad sight. The market at Piazza Navona was known throughout the world."" ""Now it's a different Rome, it's a different piazza,"" he added. ""But then the whole world has changed."" Among the signs of that change are the ubiquitous law enforcement officers occupying the square. After terrorist attacks in European cities like Nice, France, and an assault on the Christmas market in Berlin in 2016, security was increased throughout Italy over the holidays, especially in high-risk areas and at attractions that regularly draw crowds. At Piazza Navona, in addition to the checks at the square's entrances, army trucks were parked at strategic points and dozens of officers strolled among civilian visitors. But the tight security was not daunting to some Roman families making the annual pilgrimage. Alessio De Gregori, an optician, said he had not thought twice about going with his family, including two small children in strollers. ""Nowadays, security measures are everywhere,"" he said on Saturday, adding that he believed Rome was immune from a terrorist attack. ""We are lucky,"" he said. ""As long as we have this pope, nothing will happen. At least, I hope so."" The Christian feast of the Epiphany celebrates the visit of the Magi to the baby Jesus, but in Italy, the Befana tradition grew out of ancient pagan rituals and it has been celebrated in one form or another for centuries. On Friday, the farmers' association Coldiretti estimated that 45 percent of all households in the country hung up a Befana stocking. That happens, the association said in a statement, even among those who do not celebrate the holiday, or who do not have children at home. But the holiday spirit is especially heartfelt in the capital. Rome's native bard, Giuseppe Gioachino Belli, composed odes to the Befana in the 19th century. The composer and violinist Ottorino Respighi titled the fourth movement of his 1928 ""Feste Romane"" ""La Befana,"" capturing the cacophonous market. That reverence and enthusiasm seem more suited to the distant past. The holiday was abolished by Parliament in 1977, along with other religious holidays, but it was later reinstated. Now, the Piazza Navona tradition ""is dead,"" declared Sergio Balestrini, whose association has organized an annual Epiphany parade at the Vatican since 1986 to celebrate the reinstatement of the holiday. He said the market ""used to be a fairy tale; now it's just four bedraggled cats"" selling cheap Chinese toys. ""If we speak of tradition in cultural terms, it's gone,"" Mr. Balestrini said. ""It's become unrecognizable; we used to go to eat seasonal sweets and see the Befana. Now the important thing is to sell."" Some critics compared the situation at Piazza Navona to Rome's Christmas tree, which was nicknamed Spelacchio, or mangy, because of its sad, spindly appearance. The tree, mocked on social media, has since become a sensation, and city officials were expected to decide on its future on Monday. The Italian news media have reported that the tree, in Piazza Venezia, could be consigned to the national contemporary art museum, or transformed into a wooden hut for women to nurse their babies, most likely not in the piazza. Previous city administrations had raised the alarm about problems with the Befana market. In 2014, it did not open because of the dwindling quality of the market and its products, as well as questions about the kiosk concessions. Critics claimed some vendors had been given a monopoly. Cultural events were substituted for the commercial kiosks, but Romans agreed that they just weren't the same. ""Rome always had a feast of the Befana; we didn't have Santa Claus growing up. That came later,"" said Sabrina Alfonsi, the Democratic Party president of Rome's first municipality since 2013. Ms. Alfonsi tried to ""requalify the market"" by opening up the criteria for the kiosk licenses, but she was unsuccessful. Complaints these days have mostly been directed at the city's Five Star Movement government, which, critics say, has been unable to give the market the shake-up it sorely needs. When city officials decided to reboot the market this season, they decreased the number of kiosks by half ""to make room for games and recreational activities for children and respond to the true spirit of this event,"" according to city documents. The trouble is, there are now few child-friendly recreational activities in the square, save for a puppet theater with hourly shows, three stands with knock-down carnival games and a 19th-century German carousel, a market mainstay. When Viviana Piccirilli Di Capua was a child, an indefinite number of decades ago, her parents would take her to Piazza Navona on the eve of Epiphany to stroll through the kiosks. ""It was such a thrill, but we had to rush home before 9 o'clock, because if the Befana didn't find you in bed when she passed by your home, you wouldn't get presents,"" she recalled. ""Over the years, the market has been ruined, losing its beauty, décor and attention to the products,"" said Ms. Piccirilli, who is the president of an association of residents of Rome's historical center who has lobbied to gentrify the market. ""We were hoping to bring back artisanal goods and tradition, but it hasn't happened,"" she said. ""My beloved Rome has lost the ability to transmit its beauty; why do we always show something inferior to the possibilities that this city has,"" Ms. Piccirilli said. ""Above all, this is a feast for children, but the only joyous thing is the merry-go-round."""
News,2018-01-07,"LOS ANGELES — There is no generational nostalgia for the characters. The January release date allowed piracy to flourish online, cutting into ticket sales. Hollywood imports are losing their luster as local studios become more skilled at making blockbuster-style movies.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/movies/jumanji-last-jedi-box-office.html,530," LOS ANGELES — There is no generational nostalgia for the characters. The January release date allowed piracy to flourish online, cutting into ticket sales. Hollywood imports are losing their luster as local studios become more skilled at making blockbuster-style movies. Whatever the reason, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (Disney) collapsed in China, the world's second-largest movie market, arriving this weekend to estimated ticket sales over three days of $28.7 million. To compare, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" took in $53 million over its first two days in Chinese cinemas in 2016. Last year, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" managed $31 million over its first three days. Disney promoted ""The Last Jedi"" extensively in China, staging a red carpet premiere at the Shanghai Disney Resort, replete with a squadron of Stormtroopers, and securing marketing partnerships with companies like Pepsi, Alibaba, Samsung and Youku. But the efforts fell flat: ""The Last Jedi"" was no match for a holdover local comedy, ""The Ex-File 3: The Return of the Exes,"" which took in an estimated $86.7 million. Dave Hollis, Disney's president of distribution, acknowledged on Sunday that the China results were softer than the studio had hoped for. Disney declined to comment further. ""The Last Jedi,"" of course, has been a smash hit almost everywhere else. After four weeks of release, the movie has collected $1.21 billion worldwide, with North American audiences contributing $572.5 million. Hollywood will try again in China next weekend, when ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" (Sony) is scheduled for release. There is reason for Sony to be optimistic. ""Jumanji,"" a visual-effects-driven comedy led by Dwayne Johnson, has already delivered better-than-expected results elsewhere in the world, including in North America, where it ranked No. 1 over the weekend, with estimated ticket sales of $36 million. Since its arrival in North America on Dec. 20, ""Jumanji"" has collected $244.4 million, for a worldwide total of about $500 million. Second place for the weekend in the United States and Canada went to the horror sequel ""Insidious: The Last Key"" (Universal), which arrived to an estimated $29.3 million in ticket sales — or almost 30 percent more than for its series predecessor, ""Insidious: Chapter 3,"" managed over its first three days in 2015. It is unusual for the fourth film in a series to pick up steam. The strong results for ""The Last Key,"" which is rated PG-13, can be attributed in part to a well-chosen release date. The first weekend in January has historically been kind to horror movies, as teenagers flee their families after the holidays. ""The Last Key"" also comes from Blumhouse, which has become a brand, the result of successes like ""Get Out,"" ""Happy Death Day,"" ""Ouija"" and ""Split."" Blumhouse has made its name by shaking up horror formulas. ""The Last Key,"" for instance, is aimed at teenage girls. But it stars a septuagenarian actress, Lin Shaye, who has never before had the lead role in a film. Also of note at the box office: Aaron Sorkin's well-reviewed ""Molly's Game"" (STXfilms), starring Jessica Chastain as a woman who runs high-stakes underground poker games, took in a solid $7 million in semi-wide release (1,608 theaters), for a new domestic total of $14.2 million."
briefing,2018-01-07,Good morning. ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/briefing/north-korea-jerusalem-golden-globes.html,1226," Good morning.  Here's what you need to know: • President Trump started 2018 with such a furious wave of Twitter posts — threatening North Korea and urging protesters to overthrow the Iranian government, to name just a few — that some worry that America's credibility is at risk. Two things stand out, our chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe writes: How far the tweets deviate from the way past presidents expressed themselves. And how rarely Mr. Trump has followed through on his words. Mr. Trump over the weekend dismissed questions about his mental fitness that were raised in a new book,  calling himself a ""very stable genius."" _____ • North and South Korea start high-level talks on Tuesday aimed at easing tensions and allowing North Korean athletes to participate in the Winter Olympics next month. The talks could lead to a thaw in the tensions over the North's nuclear program, but President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has vowed to take a tough line in negotiations. And for decades, U.S. intelligence officials warned that the North was making progress on a missile that could reach the United States. But the last breakthroughs happened much faster than they had expected. _____ • In India,  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity is eroding as the once-roaring economy cools down. Economists agree that two of Mr. Modi's biggest policy gambles — abruptly voiding most of the nation's currency and imposing a sweeping new sales tax — have slowed India's meteoric growth. Now that his economic strategy is losing its sheen, Mr. Modi may lean even more heavily on Hindu nationalism, a risky gambit as social tensions simmer, especially between Hindus and Muslims and among castes. _____ • President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital is seen by many as the death knell for a  two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And even the Palestine Liberation Organization is asking if that might not be such a bad idea. But Israeli and Palestinian visions of what that single state would look like are mutually exclusive. Separately, the financial ties between Israel and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, continue to deepen, even with Mr. Kushner's diplomatic role in the Middle East. _____ • At almost twice the length of the U.S.-Mexico border, Australia's dingo fence is the longest in the world. The idea is simple: to keep feral dogs and dingoes from getting to sheep farms on the other side of the wire. But new research has raised questions about the fence's environmental impact, and new technology threatens to upend its traditional means of maintenance. Meanwhile, Sydney recorded its highest temperatures since 1939, with western areas hitting 117 degrees Fahrenheit, or 47 Celsius. _____ • The Golden Globes are Sunday night, the first major Hollywood gathering since the explosive revelations last year of sexual assault and harassment. Women attending have been asked to wear black on the red carpet, in solidarity with the #MeToo movement. Above, the actress Andrea Riseborough. In a series of essays, our reporters discuss whether the red carpet will ever be the same after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. The show starts at 8 p.m. Eastern, with Seth Meyers hosting. We'll have live coverage. _____ • Ripple is now the second-largest virtual currency behind Bitcoin. One of its founders even briefly overtook Mark Zuckerberg on the world's richest list with a worth of more than $59 billion. • ""So we're kicking off 2018 with a nightmare."" That was our tech reporter on the emergence of Meltdown and Spectre, two of the worst computer security flaws yet. • Several of Uber's early shareholders, including Travis Kalanick, its former chief executive, were said to be selling large chunks of stock to a consortium led by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate. • Here's a snapshot of global markets. • China and South Korea were searching for 32 sailors, including 30 Iranians, after their oil tanker collided with a freighter off China's east coast late Saturday.

[The Sydney Morning Herald] • The YouTube star Logan Paul brought new infamy to Japan's Aokigahara Forest. But local officials have been fighting for years to reverse the forest's reputation as a suicide spot.

But a recent injury threatens his quest to become the first repeat men's Olympic champion since 1952. • A cat named Oscar was seemingly better than most doctors at anticipating when a terminally ill patient was about to die. Could computers be trained to predict death? • And an insatiable starfish species appears to be decimating the Great Barrier Reef. The culprit, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has an extrudable stomach that wraps around the coral to ingest it. When unrest erupted in Iran this month, President Trump used Twitter to directly reach out to anti-government protesters in dozens of towns. Such public outreach is a lot easier than it used to be. A hundred years ago today, President Woodrow Wilson, above, outlined his terms for an end to World War I in a speech meant to appeal to the war-weary people of America's European foes. American newspapers like The New York Times printed the 14-point speech in full, but that did not mean the average German would get the message. A few days later, a report in The Times documented efforts to spread the speech behind enemy lines, after Berlin threatened to execute pilots of planes distributing copies. ""What is now wanted is some kind of flying craft which will travel fifty to a hundred miles or more, dropping propaganda on the way,"" The Daily Chronicle, a British paper, reported. ""Here is a chance for ingenious inventors to improve on the existing facilities for invading the enemy countries with moral munitions and scattering broadcast pamphlets, tracts and pictures.""

Letter,2018-01-07,To the Editor:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/immigration-health-care.html,529," To the Editor: Re ""The World Is Inside Your Hospital"" (Op-Ed, Jan. 1): I applaud Tom Brokaw for calling attention to the great diversity of national origins in the United States health care delivery system. My husband had myeloma, like Mr. Brokaw, and frequently interacted with doctors, nurses and certified nursing assistants in hospitals and doctors' offices as well as chemotherapy and radiation centers. He and I appreciated the intelligence and tenacity of the people delivering health care, who often had inspirational stories of their own or their parents' migration to the United States and of overcoming great obstacles. I would also like to call attention to another segment of the work force where there is a preponderance of immigrants: in assisted-living facilities and nursing homes. During her journey with dementia, my mother was treated with great kindness by people (mostly women) who often had low-paying jobs. As the United States population ages, we will not be well served by our increasingly restrictive immigration policies. ANNETTE EVANS, BOCA RATON, FLA. To the Editor: Immigrants not only staff our hospitals but also are a vital component of the labor force for delivering in-home health care and elder care. Working one-on-one with seriously ill and/or cognitively impaired patients many hours each day over extended periods makes significant emotional demands on caregivers. The lived experience of immigrants and refugees who have dealt with major obstacles and risks equips them with the empathy, patience and sensitivity needed for quality in-home care. In terms of formal education and professional training, many of today's home caregivers would not be admitted to the United States under the Raise Act proposed by Senators Tom Cotton and David Purdue and touted by President Trump as the solution to many of our imagined immigration ills. The legislation would sharply reduce our intake of low-skilled labor. But home caregivers are essential workers. It would be extremely difficult to replace them with American-born workers, who shun the long hours, dirty tasks, emotional demands and low pay of in-home care. Home health aide is one of the fastest-growing occupations in the United States and other highly developed countries. When Congress gets around to reforming our legal immigration system, adequate provision should be made for these and other ostensibly ""low skilled"" foreign workers. They should be welcomed, not excluded by politically motivated immigration restrictions. WAYNE A. CORNELIUSPORTLAND, ORE. The writer is professor emeritus of global public health at the University of California-San Diego. To the Editor: Tom Brokaw is right to point out the significant contribution that immigrants from all over the world make to Americans' health care. We should also note that many immigrants involved in caring for others lack health care for themselves and their families. This is especially true of those who work in private homes as nannies and elder-care providers. According to a new report from the World Health Organization, ""Women on the Move,"" such workers (mainly women) ""are exposed to many health risks themselves while enjoying few labor market and health protections."" SONYA MICHEL, SILVER SPRING, MD. The writer, professor emerita of history and women's studies at the University of Maryland, College Park, contributed to the W.H.O. report."
News,2018-01-07,"On a recent evening with a windchill of 11 degrees, I made myself put down a book I had been enjoying and go out on the streets of New York instead.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/technology/sweatcoin-fitness-app.html,1209," On a recent evening with a windchill of 11 degrees, I made myself put down a book I had been enjoying and go out on the streets of New York instead. I wasn't heading out to meet friends or do my errands. I was braving the cold for a less virtuous purpose: amassing credit on Sweatcoin, a free fitness app that awards points — ""sweatcoins"" — for walking or running outside. Accumulate 550 sweatcoins, the app beckoned, and I could snag a Fitbit Flex wearable fitness tracker. So there I was on an Arctic evening, deliberately taking a circuitous route to inflate my step count. Sweatcoin's popularity began to spike last summer. By early September, it had become the most downloaded health and fitness application in the United States on the iOS and Google Play stores combined, according to data from App Annie, an analytics firm. It has retained that top ranking nearly every week since. The app, developed by a start-up in London called Sweatco, has raised about $1.6 million in financing and expects to close another round soon. It taps into the boom for health-tracking apps and devices, joining products from Apple, Fitbit, Garmin and Samsung that monitor stats like heart rate and physical activity. Nearly 350 million wearable tech devices are expected to be sold globally this year, according to forecasts from Gartner, a market research company. Where Sweatcoin's approach differs from others, however, is in taking its ideas from behavioral economics, the study of how psychology and emotions influence our decision-making, to motivate people to exercise more. Its rise comes as insurers and corporate wellness programs are likewise furiously trying incentives — including passing out fitness monitors — to nudge people to improve their behavior. Sweatcoin's ""first premise is that physical movement has economic value,"" Anton Derlyatka, a Sweatcoin co-founder, told me. Mr. Derlyatka said the app aims to overcome our human tendency to choose immediate gratification — like doughnuts or binge-watching videos — over activities like daily exercise that offer long-term benefits. By giving consumers points that can buy goodies, Sweatcoin hopes to incentivize couch potatoes to become more active. ""It's a tool, a hack, to help all of us, not just the select few, to remain fit,"" said Oleg Fomenko, another Sweatcoin co-founder. Could the app change me, a book nerd who innately favors reading over running? Cautiously optimistic, I downloaded Sweatcoin on an iPhone over the holidays. In theory, the app awards one sweatcoin for every 1,000 outdoor steps. But I quickly learned that users often get credit for fewer steps than they expected. For one thing, Sweatcoin immediately shaves your sweatcoin earnings by 5 percent — in the fine print, the app calls it a commission ""to keep our lights on."" For another thing, the app counts only the steps it thinks you took outside. Bummer. I would get no credit for Zumba, spinning — or listening to music playlists and dancing around my kitchen while cooking. To help it distinguish outdoor steps, Sweatcoin collects and analyzes GPS signals and motion data from your phone. To improve accuracy, it instructs users to turn off the app's battery-saver mode and keep the app running in the background. And Sweatcoin gets bossy about it. The first time I swiped the app off, a notice popped up on my phone: ""You killed me! Do not force quit me if you want to generate sweatcoins."" I complied, and my battery paid the price. Frictionless this app was not. But then I noticed that Sweatcoin seemed to frequently skimp on points, too. On a recent day I went for a walk with my sister in the snowy Massachusetts countryside, the app counted less than half my steps as outdoor activity. Frustrated, I turned to reviews on Reddit, Twitter, and app stores where missing points are a common theme. "" Where are my missing 3000 steps!"" Ian Wynne, a sports performance consultant in Britain, wrote on Twitter. ""This is happening a little too often."" To commiserate, I called Mr. Wynne, who won a bronze medal in kayaking at the Athens Olympics in 2004. ""It's a little frustrating when you are outside and you are sure that you have taken 1,000 more steps than it claims,"" Mr. Wynne said. Nevertheless, he planned to continue using Sweatcoin. He regularly exercised, he said, and liked the idea of getting extra credit for the outdoor activities he was already doing. Mr. Fomenko, the Sweatcoin co-founder, told me that the app's ""draconian algorithm"" is meant to deter cheating techniques like, say, strapping a phone to a pet dog. And that fraud-deterrence system may verify fewer steps than users expect, he said. In practice, according to the app's help section, that means the Sweatcoin algorithm typically verifies 65 percent of a user's total steps. It also means that some frequent consumer behaviors — using a protective smartphone cover, walking while connected to public Wi-Fi, walking slowly with small children — could reduce your step count. In a follow-up email, Sweatcoin's co-founders said that they would soon hire a data science team ""to help us improve the speed and accuracy of this algorithm."" They also said they were working on a verification algorithm to count indoor activity. The current system seemed preposterous to me. What's the point of an unpredictable fitness app? Nevertheless, after about two weeks of intermittent use, I had earned 47.52 sweatcoins. I was feeling pretty good — a Fitbit could soon be mine. Then I learned that the rewards could also be fickle. Sweatcoin generates revenue by marketing other companies' products to its users. When a user redeems reward points for a product through Sweatcoin, the maker of that product pays Sweatcoin a fee. But the Fitbit and some other fitness devices on offer when I signed up had disappeared from the app before I could earn one. Now the reward choices included a workout app for 30 sweatcoins that didn't interest me — or the iPhone X for a whopping 20,000 sweatcoins. I calculated that, if I took 13,000 total steps every day, it would take me more than five years to get that iPhone. I felt like Sweatcoin, by offering rewards that seemed near impossible to obtain, could end up demotivating the very people it was trying to nudge to walk more. As a reporter who regularly covers data privacy, I also couldn't help being troubled by the possibility that the app could share or sell the trove of location and motion data it collects from users. Sweatcoin's founders said they would never do such a thing. ""Let me make it very, very clear,"" Mr. Derlyatka said, ""we never, ever sell anybody's user data to any outside parties."" If the fitness start-up were ever acquired by another company, however, the app's privacy policy states that ""personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets."" But the biggest downside for me was feeling like Sweatcoin's behavioral engineering cheapened important experiences. When I used the app, instead of concentrating on the friends I was walking with, I kept checking to see how close I was to being able to redeem my sweatcoins for that Fitbit. No trinket or gift card is worth that distraction."
News,2018-01-07,"ALIGARH, India — Signs and banners for Paytm, India’s biggest digital payments service, festoon Pooran Singh’s cellphone shop, where people drop in all day to add data or talk time to their prepaid phones.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/technology/india-digital-money.html,1210," ALIGARH, India — Signs and banners for Paytm, India's biggest digital payments service, festoon Pooran Singh's cellphone shop, where people drop in all day to add data or talk time to their prepaid phones. Yet few of these people actually use Paytm at the store, which straddles two dusty streets in this sleepy north Indian city in which tractors jostle with cows for space on the narrow roads. ""People recharge in cash,"" Mr. Singh said, after a young man handed him 20 rupees, about 32 cents, to top up his mother's phone. The scene in Mr. Singh's shop underscores a persistent reality of India's economy: People prefer cash for most routine transactions, despite intensive efforts by the government and global technology companies to lure them onto digital platforms. India's reluctance to give up paper money poses challenges for the firms that are vying to offer electronic payments, including local players like Paytm, which has received financing from the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and American tech companies, like Facebook, Google and PayPal. ""Cash is convenient,"" said Caesar Sengupta, who oversees Google's products for emerging markets. ""It's anonymous. You can use it everywhere."" Even so, tech companies see India's low rate of digital payments as an opportunity. They all cite China, where in just a few years, mobile payments became so popular that it is now difficult to get through the day with cash alone. ""In India, we're going to see a similar rise,"" Mr. Sengupta said in November, shortly after Google introduced Tez, a payments app for India. One reason for tech companies' optimism is that digital payments in India have increased over the past year. The value of transactions using digital wallets, the business on which Paytm was built, rose 64 percent from December 2016 to December 2017. Transactions made with the Unified Payments Interface, a government-backed technology used by Tez and many other mobile apps, went from virtually nothing a year ago to $2.1 billion last month. Leading India's budding payments shift are Paytm and its chief executive, Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Mr. Sharma founded the company seven years ago as a way for cellphone users to pay their bills online. It is now India's largest consumer-payments app, with 302 million account holders and 90 million active users. Customers can use it to buy goods at physical stores, book movie or airline tickets, send money to each other or order items from Paytm's online mall. A transaction requires a quick scan of a merchant's bar code or a few taps on a smartphone, rivaling Apple Pay or Venmo in simplicity. Mr. Sharma aspires to put his company at the center of Indians' financial lives, and he has pledged to spend $1.9 billion over the next two years toward that goal. ""Our truest ambition is for Paytm to be known as the bank for this new-age, digital, mobile world,"" he said in an interview at the company's headquarters in Noida, just outside Delhi. Merchants like Mr. Singh are crucial to Paytm's plans. The company pays Mr. Singh a bounty of 20 rupees for each of the eight or so customers he signs up each month, with additional payments if a newcomer continues to use the service. He earns an additional 18 rupees each time he verifies the identity of an existing Paytm user with his fingerprint scanner, a new requirement imposed by the government on all digital wallet companies. Mr. Singh's phone shop has also become a virtual A.T.M. for Paytm's nascent banking division, which plans to turn 100,000 shops across India into mini-branches where customers can deposit and withdraw cash, get a loan and buy insurance policies. ""We really want to reach the underserved, underbanked customer,"" said Renu Satti, who leads the Paytm bank. Paytm's strategy dovetails with the goals of India's central government. Narendra Modi, who became prime minister in 2014, has sought to recast his country as ""digital India,"" and his government has heavily promoted cashless transactions. In November 2016, Mr. Modi suddenly banned most of India's currency. The edict forced people to exchange their rupees for new notes at banks, setting off a short-term cash crunch and prompting many Indians to consider digital options. Still, the country's cash economy has endured. Only one-third of India's 1.3 billion residents have access to the internet. Of those who are able to go online, just 14 percent make mobile payments at least once a week, according to Kantar TNS, a research firm based in London. Consumer trust is a big issue. Ghani Khan, who was finishing a snack with his wife at Aligarh's lone McDonald's, said that someone had once stolen 3,300 rupees, what would be about $52 now, from his Paytm account. ""People feel scared to use these apps,"" Mr. Khan said. Although he got his money back, he now avoids payment apps, preferring to use cash or his debit card. (Paytm says that most such problems are related to thieves who call users and persuade them to turn over sensitive account data.) Merchants also worry that officials are promoting digital transactions as a way to better track commerce — and collect more taxes. Anusheel Shrivastava, a top Kantar executive in India, said his firm found that 6 percent of mobile phone users made at least one digital transaction a day in 2017, up from 2 percent in 2016. That number is likely to increase further when WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, adds payments to its service in the next few months. Paytm stands out in part because of the 10,000 employees that it has in the field to help new businesses use the service, educate existing ones about new features and troubleshoot problems. There are about six million merchants in its network, from giant multinationals like Uber to tiny neighborhood sweet shops. ""We have to train them, we have to retrain them, we have to visit them,"" said Yashwin Gupta, who oversees a team of 65 Paytm representatives in the region that includes Aligarh. ""That's our daily job."" The job is getting easier now that Paytm is better known. Last month, Mukesh Gupta sought Paytm's help in setting up the service for his toy shop here after 10 to 20 percent of his customers asked to pay with Paytm. ""People like to spend money on more than just needs,"" he said. Aligarh, with 1.2 million residents, is a barometer for Paytm's progress because it's a midsize city, and because Mr. Sharma, the company's chief executive, grew up nearby. On one visit home, he said, he met a Hindi-speaking merchant who did not know how to get money out of Paytm and into his bank. The problem? Paytm's app for merchants was in English, and the icons were not clear enough for those who did not speak the language. Paytm soon developed a Hindi version. In recent months, skeptics have questioned whether Paytm can maintain its growth. The new regulations requiring customer verification could turn off some customers. The company is also spending heavily on incentives, such as giving cash back on certain purchases and free credit-card processing for merchants. Mr. Sharma said such expenses were necessary investments. ""The only way to grow digital transactions is to make them free,"" he said. ""This is a culturally different country being built."""

Along the way, she passes a newspaper and street signs that say, ""Hollywood Sexual Harassment Scandal Reaches New Lows"" and ""U.S. Senator Accused of Groping."" When she gets into the car, she sees another sign that says, ""Ride-Hail Drivers Suspected of Rape."" The car doors lock, and the driver turns around and suggestively asks, ""Shall we?"" Just then, ""#MeToo"" pops up on her phone's screen. ""When you accept a ride from a ride-hail app, you also accept the risks that come with it,"" Ms. Anderson says in a voice-over. ""Many ride-hail companies consider their drivers third-party providers, so they don't have to accept any responsibility or accountability for their actions. Always ride responsibly."" The 60-second ad, to be released Monday, is the third in a campaign introduced in 2015 by the National Limousine Association to promote Ride Responsibly, an initiative that encourages riders to ""think before you app."" It is an attempt by the association to focus on allegations of attacks by drivers for ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft, which happen to be its competitors. In November, for instance, two women sued Uber, claiming their drivers raped them in separate cases in Florida and California. And last month an Uber driver in Beirut, Lebanon, was arrested in connection with the killing of Rebecca Dykes, a British diplomat. In September, when Transport for London, the agency that oversees that city's subways, buses and taxis, declined to renew Uber's license to operate there, it said that ""Uber's approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues."" They included, it said, how Uber deals with serious criminal offenses and conducts driver background checks. Although Ms. Anderson said the new ad was aimed at young ride-hailing customers, Scott Solombrino, a founder of the National Limousine Association and the chief executive of Dav El/Boston Coach, said it was also directed at corporate travel managers. He said these managers ""might not understand the risk factors"" of using companies like Uber and Lyft, which he said were trying to move ""into the corporate space."" Some experts, however, question the association's strategy and messaging. ""Some believe they can use regulation and scare tactics to halt an industry's advancement,"" said Greeley S. Koch, executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, a trade group. ""Business travelers are smart. They will make the best decision for their needs based on cost, convenience and safety."" Gary L. Kessler, a member of the limousine group, said that ""any conversations about safety in ground transportation are valid and productive discourses to have."" But not conversations that ""oversimplify matters and demonize particular market participants,"" added Mr. Kessler, whose chauffeur service, Carey International, recently established a partnership with Gett, a ride-sharing company backed by Volkswagen. Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst for Atmosphere Research, suggested that ""anyone who thinks the N.L.A. is sponsoring this purely out of the goodness of its heart is naïve."" ""The N.L.A. is sponsoring this because undoubtedly on-demand transportation networks are taking a meaningful amount of their business,"" he said. Asked to comment on the Ride Responsibly campaign, a Lyft spokeswoman, Alexandra LaManna, said it ""misleads consumers about the many benefits and safety features of Lyft."" ""All drivers must pass rigorous screenings, including criminal background and driving-record checks, before they're able to drive for Lyft, and every ride is covered by a $1 million liability insurance policy,"" she added. ""Implying otherwise is simply not true."" Brooke Anderson, a spokeswoman for Uber, acknowledged that ""no means of transportation is 100 percent free of incidents and accidents,"" but added, ""Uber feels a responsibility to contribute to safety, help fight tough issues and mitigate any incidents."" Among the measures that Uber uses to promote these efforts, she said, are logging the driver's information and making it available to the rider to verify the right car; tracking every trip with GPS technology; screening drivers; and offering a feature that lets riders and drivers send details of their trips to others who can monitor them. The first video by the campaign, in 2015, was animated and did not involve Ms. Anderson. Her first video for the campaign, in 2016, featured her playing ""The Driving Game,"" interviewing contestants to be her driver. She helped create the campaign's second and third videos, and said that although she felt the second video should be ""fun"" to get viewers' attention, she wanted the latest one ""to be a more serious message, a more serious approach, with so many sexual assaults in the climate today."" For the latest effort, Ms. Anderson also enlisted Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment — an organization that works nationwide to prevent sexual assault and heal survivors. On Monday, P.A.V.E. is starting a letter-writing campaign asking elected officials in every state to require ride-hailing services to adhere to minimum safety standards; it will also introduce a related social media campaign and website, www.RideHailingSafely.com."
Editorial,2018-01-08,"The key to understanding the Trump administration’s approach to policy, it seems, is to look at what most Americans want and then imagine the opposite.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/jeff-sessionss-war-marijuana.html,703," The key to understanding the Trump administration's approach to policy, it seems, is to look at what most Americans want and then imagine the opposite. Consider the new guidance on marijuana that Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued last week, which reverses Obama-era policy and gives prosecutors more leeway to enforce federal laws against the drug in states where it is legal. Mr. Sessions has been on a lifelong crusade against the plant, which he considers the root of many of society's ills. And yet more than six in 10 Americans, and seven in 10 of those under 30, believe marijuana should be legal, twice as many as in 2000. Three-quarters of the public believe the federal government should not prosecute the drug's sale or use in states where it is legal. In other words, the new policy is deeply unpopular. Many of its harshest critics are members of the president's own party, who expressed outrage at the reversal of Mr. Trump's  campaign promise to leave the matter to the states. Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, where legalized marijuana has spawned a $1 billion industry, threatened to  block all nominees to the Justice Department until the new policy is dropped. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican, laid the blame at the feet of Mr. Sessions, saying he ""betrayed us on this."" A 2014 law co-sponsored by Mr. Rohrabacher prohibits the Justice Department from going after users, growers or sellers of medical marijuana in states where it is legal. The use of recreational marijuana became legal in California on Jan. 1. Even Matt Gaetz, the Florida representative last seen trying to get the special counsel Robert Mueller fired, said the new policy showed Mr. Sessions's ""desire to pursue an antiquated, disproven dogma instead of the will of the American people."" None of this will bother the attorney general, a lifelong antidrug crusader who runs the Justice Department like it's 1988, when the war on drugs was at full throttle and the kneejerk political response was to be as punitive as possible. Mr. Sessions has long held a particular enmity for pot, which he continues to demonize. ""Good people don't smoke marijuana,"" he said in 2016. This is wrongheaded for so many reasons. It's out of step with current knowledge about the risks and benefits of marijuana, which the federal government classified as a Schedule I drug in 1970. By that definition, it has no accepted medical use and is more dangerous than cocaine. Obviously this is outdated, and Congress needs to do its part by removing marijuana from Schedule I. But nothing is stopping Mr. Sessions in the meantime from accepting scientific facts. The new policy is also blind to the massive cultural shift toward legalization that has been happening at the state level in recent years, after decades of outrageously harsh punishments that have fallen disproportionately on the shoulders of people of color. Eight states have now legalized marijuana for recreational use. California is now the world's largest legal market for pot. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia allow marijuana to be used for medical purposes. By the end of this year, it is estimated that legal marijuana will be a $9 billion industry. Finally, to the extent the new policy redirects scarce government resources toward more marijuana prosecutions, it will undermine efforts to address more serious drug problems, like the opioid crisis, an actual public-health emergency that kills tens of thousands of people a year. The full impact of the Sessions memo isn't immediately clear. Federal prosecutors are overstretched, and only bring a small number of marijuana prosecutions as it is. But the memo has already created legal uncertainty in states that have partly or fully legalized marijuana, leaving users, growers and sellers to wonder whether their actions will be ignored or will land them behind bars. Whatever its ultimate impact, the memo is yet another example of how the Justice Department under Jeff Sessions is turning back the clock on smart, evidence-based justice policy. His unwelcome revival of the war on drugs will last at least as long as the attorney general does. It is one of the reasons he has endured the continuing humiliations of working for Donald Trump."
News,2018-01-08,"WASHINGTON — President Trump will head to Tennessee on Monday to appeal to farmers, a key demographic that helped elect him, as he promotes his tax law and previews a new White House strategy to help rural America.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/us/politics/trump-farmers-agriculture-trade-taxes.html,1500," WASHINGTON — President Trump will head to Tennessee on Monday to appeal to farmers, a key demographic that helped elect him, as he promotes his tax law and previews a new White House strategy to help rural America. But back in Washington, some of the economic policies his administration is pursuing are at odds with what many in the farm industry say is needed, from a potentially drastic shift in trade policies that have long supported agriculture to some little-noticed tax increases in the $1.5 trillion tax law. American farmers are facing some of the most challenging times in a generation. Global prices for their products — including corn, wheat and other commodities — are mired in a multiyear slump, and the rural economy has remained sluggish since the recession. Net farm income has been roughly halved in the last four years, the largest four-year decrease since the Great Depression, the American Farm Bureau Federation says. Many farmers and farm states supported the president, whose campaign made overtures to parts of America that had been left behind economically and felt overlooked in Washington. The farm community has cheered the president's deregulatory agenda, especially a move to rescind tighter regulations on water pollution. Mr. Trump's appearance at the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention in Nashville on Monday will mark the first time in 25 years a president has attended. In his speech to the group, the president is likely to touch on the successful passage of the tax bill and his administration's initiatives to combat opioid addiction, White House officials said in a briefing on Friday. The White House is also expected to release a report Monday on reviving rural prosperity, which will outline goals for helping rural areas, including expanding high-speed internet, health services, work-force training and the use of biotechnology. The report stems from an executive order Mr. Trump signed in April. ""What we often see communicated about rural America is that there are these isolated pockets of despair that are beyond hope or recovery,"" Ray Starling, the special assistant to the president for agriculture, agricultural trade and food assistance on the National Economic Council, said in a briefing Friday. The report makes clear that ""that's not what we believe."" Yet some of the president's economic policies could actually harm the farm industry. New analyses of the tax law by economists at the Department of Agriculture suggest it could actually lower farm output in the years to come and effectively raise taxes on the lowest-earning farm households, while delivering large gains for the richest farmers. And the administration's trade policies continue to be a concern for farmers, who benefit from access to other markets, including by exporting their products. Mr. Trump continues to threaten to withdraw from trade pacts if other countries do not grant the United States a better deal, a position that has put him at odds with much of the farm industry. ""Trade has become an increasingly important and substantial part of the ag economy. So anything that causes a ripple in that can have not just little effects but significant effects,"" said Dale Moore, the executive director for public policy at the Farm Bureau. Indeed, part of the White House report Monday is expected to discuss global markets' importance to rural America. Agriculture has been the biggest beneficiary of pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which have allowed the United States to export grains and meat. In April, when the president came to the brink of withdrawing the United States from the pact, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue helped to dissuade him by showing him a map of the part of the country that would be hardest hit — farming states that also helped to elect Mr. Trump. ""It creates a lot of anxiety across all of agriculture, particularly the U.S. pulling out of Nafta,"" said Kevin Kester, a rancher in California and the president-elect of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Farmers and ranchers like Mr. Kester worry that they are losing ground to foreign competitors, as major markets like Japan, Europe and Mexico push ahead with their own trade pacts. Although Mr. Trump has talked about forging new bilateral deals, the United States does not appear to be close to forming any. American beef exporters are now at a big disadvantage in Japan, Mr. Kester said, after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal that would have included Japan, and Japan signed a free-trade agreement that cut tariffs for Australian beef. ""We're continuing to talk to the Trump administration and urge them to get on the horse and get going with talks with Japan in particular,"" Mr. Kester said. Nations like Canada are also beginning to export goods that have long been a staple of United States exports, such as lobster. Farmers have lobbied the president in recent months to preserve free trade agreements with Canada, Mexico and South Korea. On Thursday, a group of six Republican senators visited the White House to lobby the president on trade. Pat Roberts, the senator from Kansas who led the delegation, said the president had ""really listened to our concerns"" and ""understands the difficulty farm country is going through."" ""I delivered the message that farmers and ranchers need to grow export markets and maintain our status as a reliable supplier, more especially with Canada and Mexico in Nafta renegotiations,"" Mr. Roberts said. Trade analysts said these visits from farm state representatives and the president's trip to the Farm Bureau meeting were most likely the product of Nafta supporters inside the White House, who are trying to influence the president's views on trade. Yet there is no sign yet that these meetings have altered the president's long-held skepticism of Nafta. ""The reports we're hearing is the message is being delivered,"" said Michael Dykes, the president of the International Dairy Foods Association, an industry lobbying group. However, he said, ""we haven't seen anything visible to see that they're taking it on and changing course."" Without existing free trade agreements, many agricultural products would face prohibitively high tariffs as they cross borders. Food is still one of the most protected products under global rules. Without free trade agreements, Mexico could raise its tariffs to up to 75 percent on American chicken and Idaho potatoes. South Korea could raise its tariffs to 40 percent on beef and 36 percent on cheese. ""I believe the president is genuine when he says he wants to take care of the folks in rural America. I think he's also hearing from rural America that, hey, Nafta is critical to agriculture,"" Mr. Dykes said. ""Nafta is woven into the fabric of our business."" Mr. Trump has positioned his tax overhaul, which lowers individual and corporate rates, as an economic salve for rural America, including farmers. The new law won support from farmers, but many warn that its benefits could be blunted by a protectionist approach to trade. Stanley H. Ryan, the chief executive of Darigold, said the tax bill was ""helpful and supportive"" for businesses like his, a century-old dairy producer in Washington State. However, ""to get the full benefits of it, you've got to have market access,"" he said. The Farm Bureau endorsed both the House and Senate versions of the bill, and Mr. Trump signed a compromise measure into law in December. The final version included several provisions the bureau had championed, such as the ability for businesses to immediately deduct the cost of new investments. It also narrowed the number of households affected by the estate tax, a move the bureau praised even though it had pushed to eliminate the tax entirely. But research presented on Friday in Philadelphia, at America's annual mega-gathering of economists, suggests the bill contains downsides for the industry in general and particularly for lower-income farmers. A model of the law's effects on farm households by Siraj G. Bawa and James M. Williamson, of the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service, projects that 70 to 80 percent of the law's benefits will flow to the top 1 percent of farm households by income. The law actually shrinks tax refunds for the lowest-earning 20 percent of farm households, Mr. Bawa said in a session hosted by the Agriculture and Applied Economics Association. The reason stems from a combination of changes in the bill, including its elimination of a tax break for domestic production. ""The lowest quintile is actually getting a tax raise under this,"" Mr. Bawa said. A second paper, from Jayson Beckman and Munisamy Gopinath of the Agriculture Department and Marinos Tsigas of the United States International Trade Commission, projects that the law will reduce American farm production nearly 1 percent for primary agriculture, even though it reduces tax rates on farmers. The reason, in part, is that the tax bill's favorable treatment of other sectors, such as construction and factories, could draw investment away from agriculture. The authors suggest those reductions could be offset — if America could secure better access to foreign consumers through trade negotiations."

His absolute self-confidence — critics say, arrogance — appears to have been undaunted by roller-coaster ratings. Negotiations on changes to the French unemployment compensation system are scheduled to begin this week. Mr. Macron is in China today. _____ • In the Middle East, a de facto alliance against common foes is drawing Arab leaders into a collaboration with their onetime nemesis, Israel. One indication: We obtained audio recordings of an Egyptian intelligence officer coaxing talk show hosts to persuade their audiences to accept President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. On Sunday, Israel published a blacklist of 20 organizations, including 11 groups in Europe, whose leaders it has barred from entering the country for supporting a boycott of it. Separately, the financial ties to Israel of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, have deepened, fueling a perception of conflicts of interest. _____ • At the Golden Globe Awards, the host Seth Meyers turned directly to what he called ""the elephant not in the room,"" when he opened the broadcast by saying, ""Good evening, ladies and remaining gentlemen.""

And like many in the market for a newly built rental — where decisions often come down to fairly minor things like a month of free rent or a location half a block closer to the subway — they spent the months leading up to their move dispassionately comparing floor plans, costs and transit options. But then Ms. Lebon showed her husband a listing for a two-bedroom at 325 Kent Avenue, in Williamsburg. ""I was like, 'We have to have it,'"" said Mr. Lebon, an Australian shoe designer who recognized the site — across the street from the Domino Sugar Factory — as the place he had roamed during the Kara Walker exhibition in 2014. ""I knew the area. I walked all around it, and I thought it was amazing,"" Mr. Lebon said. ""I told Kat about it when I got home because I thought it would be really cool to live there."" Not that his neighborhood choice hasn't inspired a few eye-rolls. ""When I tell people I moved to Williamsburg, they say, 'Of course, you did,'"" he said, adding that being somewhat off the beaten path had, at least, garnered a little more respect. Mr. Lebon, who has traveled to New York City for work frequently over the past decade, had ruled out Manhattan as too manic for a couple with two young children (their son, Hugo, is 4, and their daughter, Indie, 2). And he liked the relative calm of the southern side of the Williamsburg waterfront. Calm, that is, if not exactly quiet. They were among the first to move into their building, which is part of a site being developed by Two Trees (as well as the first building to open there). And now they are surrounded by construction. ""Every day, they start with the jackhammers next door at 7 a.m. and they finish at 6 p.m.,"" Ms. Lebon said. ""But we moved to New York to be amid the noise. We love that we get to see all the construction."" During the summer, they were likewise charmed by the parties and pop-up events at the temporary park across the street, Mr. Lebon said: ""We'd open the window and listen to live music. Once there was a huge line around the block when we came home — Shake Shack was giving away burgers."" On a recent morning, arctic temperatures were keeping all but a few ardent cyclists off Kent Avenue, but the Lebons' apartment was bathed in warm sunlight. They had specifically sought a space with good natural light, but the view — their living room windows look directly out at the Williamsburg Bridge — was an unexpected bonus. ""Even when it's raining, it's still beautiful. You can watch the boats,"" said Ms. Lebon, whose mother, visiting from Australia and unaccustomed to having so many windows, kept pulling down the blinds. ""We were like, 'Mom! We're paying for the view!'"" The apartment rents for $5,450 a month, though a month of free rent brought it down to just under $5,000. Still, that is quite a bit more than the $4,000 budget they had set. But as they plan to stay for only two years, they decided that splurging on a place they loved was worth it. ""It was really important that my wife and kids were happy, because I was asking them to move here for my work,"" said Mr. Lebon, who is introducing his footwear company, Rollie Nation, to the United States market and recently began online sales here. Several pop-up stores are also in the works. Ms. Lebon, who left her job as a flight attendant for Qantas shortly before they moved, manages the apparel store, Lost in Seasons, that the couple owns in Melbourne. While they are here, they are renting out their place in Australia, a renovated four-story warehouse of approximately 4,300 square feet. The move has shown them ""that bigger isn't better,"" Ms. Lebon said. ""Here, we utilize every single room. And the kids are willing to sleep by themselves because they're in bunk beds."" As Mr. Lebon said, ""Now every purchase is really considered. We're living the minimalist life."" He added: ""The house in Melbourne had a very different vibe, very Restoration Hardware. With a four-story house, you don't realize that it's getting cluttered until it's too late."" Another difference, they said, is the dress code in New York. In Melbourne, ""People judge everything: how you color your hair, what you wear to take your kids to kinder,"" Ms. Lebon said. ""It's even worse for a guy,"" Mr. Lebon said. ""If I wear camo or Off-White sneakers, people would be like, 'What the hell is that?' Here people wear whatever they want. You can express yourself, and no one is judging you. I'm a footwear designer and my wife runs a fashion retail store, so it's our life and our living."" Such openness, he has found, extends beyond fashion. ""You don't feel like you're trying to do your own thing alone,"" he said. ""There's a lot of collaboration and much more of a can-do atmosphere."" As Ms. Lebon put it, ""You feel like anything is possible."" They like New York so much, she said, that they are reconsidering their two-year plan: ""I think we're already looking at longer."""
News,2018-01-08,"The year ahead is shaping up to be one of more change for travelers, with new airport security procedures and identification requirements, airline routes and airports, high-speed trains; and the reopening of more hotels in the Caribbean after a brutal hurricane season. Below, a preview. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/travel/what-to-expect-in-2018.html,1045," The year ahead is shaping up to be one of more change for travelers, with new airport security procedures and identification requirements, airline routes and airports, high-speed trains; and the reopening of more hotels in the Caribbean after a brutal hurricane season. Below, a preview.  In 2017, the Transportation Security Administration announced that it would begin rolling out stronger screening procedures for electronics larger than a cellphone. For years, laptop computers have had to be removed from bags for screening, but now the new measures require that all electronics larger than a cellphone — like e-readers, noise-canceling headphones and hand-held game consoles — also be placed in a separate bin.  The procedures are already in place at some airport checkpoints, where they were being tested, and will be expanded to all airports and checkpoints nationwide by the spring of 2018. (The new measures do not apply to passengers in T.S.A. PreCheck lanes for travelers enrolled in the expedited government security program.) Beginning Jan. 22, if you have a driver's license or identification card issued by a state that is not compliant with the minimum security standards in what's known as the Real ID Act, you must have an alternative form of identification in order to fly domestically.  You can see if your state is compliant or has been approved for an extension, in which case you can keep using your current license (for now) at Dhs.gov/real-id. For instance, Texas and Vermont are among the states that are compliant; California, Pennsylvania, New York and Louisiana have extensions.  A list of alternative acceptable forms of identification — like a United States passport or a Department of Homeland Security trusted traveler card (such as Global Entry, Nexus, Sentri or Fast) — is at Tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification.  New routes are coming for spring and summer travel. Beginning in April, United Airlines will offer year-round service to Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, as well as from Washington Dulles International Airport. The airline will also fly to Elmira/Corning Regional Airport in New York from Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. There will be new routes between Los Angeles and Oregon, and Denver and Florida, too.  From June 7, those wishing to visit the nation's national parks will have more options, with seasonal service between O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Fresno Yosemite International Airport in California; and Los Angeles International Airport and Glacier Park International Airport and Missoula International Airport, both in Montana.  In October, United plans to begin service between San Francisco and Faa'a International Airport in Tahiti, which the company said will make it the only United States carrier offering nonstop service there from the mainland United States.  JetBlue said that beginning May 3 it will increase its presence in New England, with nonstop service between Worcester Regional Airport in Massachusetts and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, becoming the only commercial airline to serve Worcester. On that same day, JetBlue also plans to begin nonstop service between Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and Boston Logan International Airport. American Airlines is homing in on Canada, adding service from its hub in Chicago's O'Hare International Airport to Vancouver International Airport beginning May 4. Seasonal service to Calgary International Airport from O'Hare begins June 7. There will be more flights from the east coast of the United States to eastern Canada as well, including Toronto, Ottawa and Quebec City.  Also in June, Delta Air Lines will offer new nonstop service between Mineta San Jose International Airport in California and John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. Looking for a deal? Norwegian Air, the low-cost, long-haul carrier, is planning 11 new trans-Atlantic routes for 2018, including service from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands (beginning May 7) and to Madrid-Barajas Airport in Spain (beginning July 18). There will also be service from Los Angeles International Airport to Milan (beginning June 18) and Madrid (beginning July 16). When deciding what to pack, you may need to think twice about so-called smart bags that allow travelers to do things like charge their portable electronic devices and lock the bag remotely.  Beginning Jan. 15, major airlines, including American, Delta, United, Hawaiian and Alaska will no longer accept smart bags with lithium-ion batteries unless the batteries can be removed on site. Why? Because, as Delta put it, the batteries have the potential to overheat and start a fire during flight. So if you're planning to travel with a smart bag, be sure you know how to remove the battery before leaving home.  In addition to new airport rules, the year ahead will also bring new airports.  Relations between the United States and Turkey may be strained, but a state-of-the-art airport, Istanbul New Airport (yes, that's what it's called), is slated to be completed in 2018 and will become the primary gateway to the city.  And in Israel, Eilat City Airport and Ovda Airport, the entry points for the country's popular southern resort town of Eilat, will be replaced by the new Ramon International Airport.  In Paris, Airbnb announced that, beginning in January 2018, it will cap the number of days each year that hosts can rent out dwellings in neighborhoods in central Paris — the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Arrondissements — to comply with the country's limit (120 days a year, according to Reuters) on short-term home rentals. Airbnb has already tested the cap in other major cities like London. For tourists, that could mean a more competitive rental market in Paris's most popular arrondissements, so be sure to book early. In Israel, a new high-speed train connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, slated to open in April, will be the country's first electric railway line. The Israel Ministry of Tourism said the new train will take 28 minutes between the cities, down from the current 80 minutes it takes by bus.  In the Caribbean, where the recovery continues for hard-hit islands, some major hotels are planning to reopen in 2018, including the Four Seasons Anguilla and CuisinArt Golf Resort and Spa in Anguilla.

Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/briefing/stephen-bannon-golden-globes-consumer-electronics-show.html,1266,"  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: • Days after Stephen Bannon was quoted in a new book accusing Donald Trump Jr. of treason, the former chief strategist backed away from the comment on Sunday, saying President Trump's eldest son was ""a patriot and a good man."" (Read Mr. Bannon's statement here.) Over the weekend, the president and his supporters harshly criticized the book, ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,"" which raises questions about the president's mental fitness. In a tweet, Mr. Trump called himself a ""very stable genius."" • Genius or not, the president has left many countries unsure whether his messages on Twitter reflect U.S. foreign policy or can be safely ignored. If his threats are hollow, what does that do to American credibility? Our chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe explored that question. • A previously undisclosed $30 million deal last spring illustrates the growing financial ties between the family business of Jared Kushner, who has a prominent diplomatic role in the Middle East, and Israeli partners. The business dealings don't appear to violate ethics laws, and there is no evidence that Mr. Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, was involved in reaching the deal. • But the arrangement could undermine the perception of the U.S. as an independent broker in the region. ""I think it's reasonable for people to ask whether his business interests are somehow affecting his judgment,"" a lawyer who specializes in government ethics said of Mr. Kushner. • It is a quiet but telling trend across the country: Towns and cities are policing and governing themselves, hoping to increase protection against drug cartels — and against the Mexican state. We visited three enclaves that have created havens of relative safety. But their gains are fragile and have come at significant cost. • The areas ""are exceptions that prove the rule,"" our columnists write. ""Mexico's crisis manifests as violence, but it is rooted in the corruption and weakness of the state."" • The Golden Globes on Sunday were the first major awards show since allegations of sexual misconduct swept Hollywood, but it was a rousing speech by Ms. Winfrey that defined the night and captured the #MeToo mood. ""What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have,"" Ms. Winfrey said, accepting a lifetime achievement award. ""I'm especially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories."" (Read the full speech here.) • Our journalists discussed the show as it happened. We also have a full list of the winners, and pictures from the red carpet. • Nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador who have been allowed to live in the U.S. legally for more than a decade will have to leave, officials in Washington said today. Homeland Security is ending a humanitarian program that gave temporary protected status to Salvadorans after a pair of devastating earthquakes struck their country in 2001, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. • It is the Trump administration's latest reversal of immigration policies, and one of the most consequential to date. • President Trump heads to Tennessee today, where he is to give a speech intended to cast him as a friend of farmers. But his positions on trade and some parts of the new tax law threaten to undercut farmers' interests. • India's government and global technology companies are trying to coax people to give up their rupee notes, but some say they feel safer with cash. • The start of the International Consumer Electronics Show is one of the headlines to watch this week. • U.S. stocks were up on Friday. Here's a snapshot of global markets today. Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • Nine tips for navigating the workplace. • And eight ways to improve a relationship. • Recipe of the day: A meatless dinner of chickpea and fennel ratatouille. • At Kennedy International Airport in New York, a broken water main complicated operations that were already in disarray after last week's snowstorm. • Australia experienced  a short-lived but blistering heat wave, including a high of just over 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47.3 degrees Celsius) in a Sydney suburb. • Carrie Gracie, a  senior editor for BBC News, accused the network of operating a ""secretive and illegal"" salary system that pays men more than women in similar positions. • Christmas is officially over. Look at Epiphany celebrations around the world. • The quarterback for the Tennessee Titans caught his own pass for a touchdown, one of the highlights of the first round of the N.F.L. playoffs. • ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" was No. 1 at the North American box office. But the weekend's big movie news was in China, where ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" earned only $28.7 million. • In memoriam John Young walked on the moon, commanded the first space shuttle mission and became the first person to fly in space six times. He was 87. • Southern pride, Northern tune The Georgia Bulldogs' unofficial fight song has roots in a Civil War rallying cry for the North. We retraced the song's history ahead of Georgia's game tonight against Alabama. College football's national championship game begins at 8 p.m. Eastern. • Quiz time! Did you keep up with last week's news? Test yourself. • Quotation of the day ""You would think with water mains breaking all over town they would have a contingency plan. A couple of guys with squeegees doesn't seem to do the job."" — Michael Rossiter, of Jersey City, whose plans were disrupted by a water main break at Kennedy Airport. When unrest recently erupted in Iran, President Trump used Twitter to reach out directly to antigovernment demonstrators in dozens of towns. Such public outreach is a lot easier than it used to be. One hundred years ago today, President Woodrow Wilson outlined his terms for an end to World War I in a speech meant to appeal to the war-weary people of America's European foes. American newspapers such as The Times printed the 14-point speech in full, but that did not mean the average German would get the message. A few days later, a report in The Times documented efforts to spread the speech behind enemy lines, after Berlin threatened to execute pilots of planes distributing copies. ""What is now wanted is some kind of flying craft which will travel fifty to a hundred miles or more, dropping propaganda on the way,"" The Daily Chronicle, a British paper, reported. ""Here is a chance for ingenious inventors to improve on the existing facilities for invading the enemy countries with moral munitions and scattering broadcast pamphlets, tracts and pictures."" Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning. Browse past briefings here.

Op-Ed,2018-01-08,"Last week, we learned that researchers had discovered two major flaws in microprocessors of nearly all the world’s computers. The revelation came on the heels of a distressing series of major hacks: In 2017, Yahoo revealed that all of its three billion accounts were compromised, WannaCry ransomware shut down hospitals across the globe, and an Equifax breach affected approximately 145.5 million consumers in the United States. The latest news about the computer security problems — whose names, “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” appropriately convey their seriousness — is just the latest evidence that true digital security remains out of our reach.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/opinion/cybersecurity-breach-spectre-meltdown.html,905," Last week, we learned that researchers had discovered two major flaws in microprocessors of nearly all the world's computers. The revelation came on the heels of a distressing series of major hacks: In 2017, Yahoo revealed that all of its three billion accounts were compromised, WannaCry ransomware shut down hospitals across the globe, and an Equifax breach affected approximately 145.5 million consumers in the United States. The latest news about the computer security problems — whose names, ""Spectre"" and ""Meltdown,"" appropriately convey their seriousness — is just the latest evidence that true digital security remains out of our reach. But when these vulnerabilities are exposed and damaging attacks occur, there are few lasting repercussions. Almost without fail, stock prices bounce back, customers return, executives keep their jobs or exit with golden parachutes, and government mostly looks the other way. After the news of Equifax's massive breach, for example, the company's stock dropped roughly 35 percent. But it's already recovered nearly half of its lost market value, and Fortune reported that the former chief executive officer Richard Smith retired with as much as $90 million in compensation. Resilience is one of the hallmarks of stable, mature markets, but something isn't right here. The tepid consequences are part of a growing problem. From a corporate governance and accountability perspective, cybersecurity today is being treated like accounting was before the fallout from the Enron scandal inspired the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's increased standards for corporate disclosures. With the privacy and personal data of hundreds of millions of people at risk, and especially now with the increasing ubiquity of connected devices in our lives, the security of digital assets is too important for that kind of treatment. We need to bolster a culture of responsibility around cybersecurity, combining stronger and more uniform corporate governance with a clearer government commitment to enact better defensive policies. A complex hack may not be a C.E.O.'s fault, but it is absolutely his or her responsibility. Investors and consumers need to demand more from the executives to whom they entrust their digital lives. The same holds true for government. Protection of the welfare and livelihood of its citizens is a foundational principle of government, and yet for more than a decade there has been very little consequence for nation-states and state-affiliated groups who've pilfered the intellectual property, and violated the personal privacy, of citizens and companies around the world. Strengthening a culture of responsibility will require changes by both companies and the government. Last year, the New York State Department of Financial Services took a promising step by implementing new data-security regulations for certain financial companies operating within the state. It includes rules for reporting cybersecurity events within 72 hours, annual proof-of-penetration tests, and, by 2020, third-party assessments — all designed to increase accountability and remove the fog of uncertainty that often surrounds breaches. The federal government would be wise to follow New York's lead and implement similar laws on the federal level. Without federal action in this regard, increased regulation of cybersecurity practices will happen anyway, but in a fragmentary and disjointed way. More uniform regulations can help a more uniform standard to emerge, providing companies with the predictability and certainty they need in order to evaluate their risk management and security investments the right way. While more must be expected of companies, more should be expected of government as well. American businesses are under attack by our nation's geopolitical adversaries, and by nonstate groups affiliated with them. Just imagine if American shipping companies were battling foreign navies, or if domestic airlines were fighting an adversary's air force. This asymmetry locks the businesses into fights they cannot win. In its most dire scenario, the increasing velocity and severity of cyberattacks on American companies may encourage more firms to take matters into their own hands by ""hacking back"" against their attackers. This would open a Pandora's box of ugly consequences. Even large Wall Street banks, spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year on security, cannot win against the Chinese or Russian militaries, so they escalate at their peril. But if private companies and individuals are not to fight back in self-defense, then their government must do a better job on their behalf. In short, the federal government must ensure that deterrence works in the digital domain. Cyberconflicts often pit the vast resources of nation-states against those of private companies. Businesses can only be reasonably expected to agree to increased cybersecurity regulation if they have confidence in the government to perform its basic function of protecting its citizens. Just as policy frameworks exist to respond to, and dissuade, physical attacks on Americans and their interests, foreign and domestic, so the government must deter adventurism in cyberspace. Notably, this doesn't merely mean that one hack justifies another — rather, the full range of diplomatic, informational, economic and military options should be on the table. Failure to make such consequences clear and credible contributes to a fundamental failure of deterrence in cyberspace and exposes the United States government, American businesses, and individual citizens to many more such attacks in the future. Every business is now a digital business, and nearly every citizen is increasingly reliant on the connected world. We live in an era of mass targeted attacks where nation state-level resources are being directed against companies and private citizens, and until our security culture changes, we can expect to see more massive breaches throughout 2018 and beyond."

Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] As parents, do we determine our children's eating habits? There's a lot of blame when it comes to childhood obesity, eating disorders and body image problems, but how much do we actually know about what works to help children eat and grow in a healthy way? Back in November, I wrote about the issue of fat stigma, and the bad things that can happen to children's health and well-being when they are shamed or bullied about being overweight. I referenced a policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics that called on pediatricians, in particular, to be careful about using harsh, stigmatizing or judgmental language with our patients around this sensitive issue. Many of the people who commented on the article wrote about the pain of being bullied or criticized as children — or in some cases, the pain of seeing a child bullied — for being overweight. However, many readers also scorned ""overweight parents feeding garbage 'foods' … to their overweight children,"" as one reader put it. ""Wake up parents,"" said another, ""Your kids don't HAVE to snack all the time. You are ruining their future health and self esteem."" ""When you are the parent of an obese child, there is tremendous stigma,"" said Dr. Julie Lumeng, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan. ""Everyone looks at the parent and thinks: That parent is incompetent. They don't care about their child. Why can't they just make the child eat less and exercise?"" There's an underlying assumption here about what adults can control, and about how children can be controlled, if only their parents would take the trouble, or make and enforce healthy rules for the whole family, or read the nutritional information on the back of the cereal box. Certainly, there's some confusion and disagreement out there about what foods are healthy, even among experts. And of course, some would say that if you're truly concerned about healthful eating, you're better off not buying much food that comes in a box. But does better nutritional awareness by parents actually translate into children eating in a healthy way? Obesity experts would say that we all live in what they call an ""obesogenic"" environment, with fast food heavily marketed, and often cheaper, than food prepared from scratch. Screens distract us from the social give and take of family meals, even while advertising processed foods, and other societal factors encourage everyone to keep on snacking and sipping. But we don't really understand all the intricacies of why some children eat to excess and become overweight while others, often in the same family, stay lean. A full acquaintance with the obesity research doesn't necessarily help parents make their daily decisions. A few years ago, Dr. Lumeng got an email from another physician who had heard her speak at a meeting, and had a 6-week-old infant who was so hungry she didn't know what to do. Should she not feed her baby, she asked? The doctor who wrote to her was Dr. Jennifer Kerns, an obesity medicine specialist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington, who had herself lost weight as a contestant on ""The Biggest Loser"" in 2006 and spent some time serving as the show's physician. She became board certified in obesity medicine, and when she later got pregnant, she said, she worried that her child might struggle with weight as she had done. ""I was really focused on my weight gain and essentially weighed myself every day of my pregnancy,"" she said. She exercised until two days before she delivered the baby. She was determined not to have a cesarean section so the baby would have a healthier microbiome from picking up the right bacteria during the passage through the birth canal. She was resolved to breast-feed. And now she had a child who was ""instantly a very dramatically hungry baby, so much so that I was unable to nurse him,"" she said. ""We tried for five weeks and I had five different lactation consultants. He wouldn't be patient enough to wait for milk to let down."" Determined to give him the benefits of breast milk, she ended up using a breast pump throughout his first year of life. Remembering a lecture Dr. Lumeng had given about voraciously hungry babies, she emailed her. ""I essentially asked if she would be willing to give me any advice, any studies, what to do if your baby seems to be starving to death."" In ""a very thoughtful and kind response,"" Dr. Kerns recalled, Dr. Lumeng wrote that there was no research to guide her. ""She couldn't really give me advice other than her own experience with her own children: Just feed him, trust your instincts."" Dr. Lumeng suggested that doctors should acknowledge to parents that ""modern science really doesn't fully understand what causes obesity."" We are expecting parents to do something for their children that we adults have great difficulty doing for ourselves, she said; of those who do successfully lose weight, many gain it back within a year. ""Adults can't keep it off either, why are we expecting parents to do this?"" When both parents and children are overweight, that's probably at least in part evidence of a common genetic predisposition, she said. And that biological risk may be expressed in part through differences in children's metabolism, but also through differences in their appetites, in their responses to food, and even in their propensity to exercise. No one is saying that biology has to be destiny, pure and simple, but it is clear that the healthy eating strategies that are easy to implement with some children are far more difficult with others. So yes, for all children, whatever their risk for obesity, good parental decisions about nutrition really matter: It's important not to overfeed babies, to keep junk food and sugary drinks out of the house, to not let kids eat in front of the screen, and to encourage kids to ""eat the rainbow"" of fruits and vegetables. But those who rush to judgment should be aware that it is not at all simple to ""say no"" all the time to an extra-hungry child, or to ""feed more vegetables"" to the kid who refuses to eat anything green. Most parents — really — are doing our best, in the complicated food environment in which our children are growing up, with the daily struggles of family life. Few of us are the effortlessly perfect models we would like to be, in eating as in so much else — and some children are more vulnerable, or more difficult, or more distressed. ""The good parenting that a lot of families exercise when it comes to health,"" said Dr. Lumeng, ""that may be good enough for a lot of kids, but with some kids with a genetic makeup that predisposes them to obesity, it's not enough."""
News,2018-01-08,Good Monday. Here’s what we’re watching:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/business/dealbook/intel-ceo-security.html,3331," Good Monday. Here's what we're watching: • The tech reckoning is gaining momentum. • Ripple's XRP virtual currency plunged over the past day. • GoPro's shares dropped after the company announced disappointing sales forecasts. • Could a sale of Twitter happen this year? Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. American technology giants are facing an increasing backlash. Google-parent Alphabet, Facebook and Twitter have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers over the manipulation of social media during the 2016 election by Russian operatives. Critics of Amazon say it is killing jobs. Across the pond, European regulators have gone after American tech firms over privacy and what officials deem anticompetitive behavior. Now Jana Partners and pension giant Calstrs are pushing Apple to do more to protect its youngest users from the effects of digital technology. Writes Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Gadfly: ""One letter from Calstrs and Jana may amount to nothing. It's becoming increasingly clear, however, that scrutiny over technology companies and their products isn't going away. ""There will be much discussion about whether technology companies, or people and parents, bear responsibility for limiting the harmful effects of technology. Even smartphone overuse isn't Apple's problem alone. Its gadgets are gateways to people hooked on Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and much more. We are all the problem, and the technology companies are all the problem."" Still, compared to Facebook, Google or Snap, Apple is an unusual choice for the investors to target, writes Jennifer Saba of Breakingviews. The company makes hardware and uses privacy as a selling point. For those reasons, Apple was expected to avoid the worst of the blowback. But its targeting shows the extent to which the backlash against tech is gaining momentum: Writes Ms. Saba: ""Silicon Valley used to enjoy an exalted status, but questions about the role of social media in the 2016 presidential election and the way digital technologies may threaten jobs and promote monopolies are breeding skepticism. The new focus on Apple shows how much technology has lost its halo."" Federal regulators have rejected a proposal by Energy Secretary Rick Perry to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear plants, in a major blow to the Trump administration's efforts to revive America's declining coal industry, the NYT reports. In September, Mr. Perry warned that the loss of these plants could threaten the ""reliability and resiliency of our nation's grid"" and asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees regional electricity markets, to guarantee financial returns for power plants that can stockpile at least 90 days' worth of fuel on-site — which, in effect, meant propping up uncompetitive coal and nuclear units. (Natural gas plants are typically fed by pipeline and would not qualify.) While a few utilities with significant coal and nuclear capacity supported the idea, Mr. Perry's proposal generated a fierce backlash from a broad coalition of energy companies, free-market groups and former regulators.  Only last week, Ripple appeared to lay claim to the biggest alternative to Bitcoin. That isn't the case anymore. The price of Ripple's XRP virtual currency has plunged about 27 percent over the past 24 hours, reaching $2.47 this morning, according to CoinMarketCap. Ripple's total market capitalization has fallen back below that of Ethereum. To be fair, other virtual currencies — including Bitcoin — are falling as well. It was only last week: Investors breathlessly touted Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, who owns a significant amount of XRP, as richer than Mark Zuckerberg. The breathlessness hasn't abated: Shares in Seagate were briefly up more than 10 percent on Monday amid excited speculation that the hard drive company owned a huge stake in XRP as part of its investment in Ripple almost three years ago. (It's not clear that's actually the case.) — Michael J. de la Merced Its announcement of preliminary fourth-quarter results today compounds the troubles for what has been one of the most disappointing market debutantes in recent years. The company issued a revenue forecast that was lighter than analysts were expecting. And the action-camera maker announced its latest efforts to turn around its business: • Laying off at least 254 employees, bringing its headcount to under 1,000 worldwide • Its founder and C.E.O., Nick Woodman, reducing his cash compensation this year to $1. • Getting out of the drone market amid ""a hostile regulatory environment"" in Europe and the U.S. Over all, GoPro's shares have fallen 79 percent since the company's I.P.O. three-and-a-half years ago. — Michael J. de la Merced Steven Milunovich, an analyst at UBS, expects the iPhone maker to use the overseas cash it repatriates to buy back $122 billion in stock through 2019. The company holds about $252 billion cash offshore. Mr. Milunovich via CNBC writes: ""Repatriation of ~$250bn of offshore cash should increase the rate of Apple's share buybacks since the company believes the stock remains attractive in that its services business is undervalued."" Apple has bought back more than $165 billion of stock over the past five years. The analyst Rich Greenfield of BTIG thinks so. Leading his list of predictions for the year is speculation that the social network would finally become the target of deal-making. (Remember that Salesforce had held talks to buy the company in the fall of 2016.) From Mr. Greenfield's note: Twitter offers a unique acquisition opportunity for any company looking to own breaking news, politics and sports, infused with video on mobile devices with tens of millions of daily active users across the world. Add to that a vast treasure trove of data on its users and a Twitter acquisition becomes compelling for many companies across the TMT universe. Who would buy Twitter? Maybe Salesforce comes back. Or maybe Google does. Or Microsoft. Other predictions • AT&T will defeat the Justice Department in the court battle over Time Warner. • CBS and Viacom finally combine. • Spotify will go public this year, but may sell itself down the road. — Michael J. de la Merced The chip-maker's stock is up 2.5 percent Monday. The driver? News that Nvidia will partner with Uber and Volkswagen on autonomous driving projects. Reuters reports: • ""Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas that Uber's self-driving car fleet was using their technology to help its autonomous cars perceive the world and make split-second decisions."" • ""With Volkswagen, Nvidia said it was infusing its artificial intelligence technology into the German automakers' future lineup, using their new Drive IX platform. The technology will enable so-called ""intelligent co-pilot"" capabilities based on processing sensor data inside and outside the car."" Some context: Shares of Nvidia more than doubled over the past 12 months after a roughly 200 percent gain in 2016. The rally in Nvidia's shares has come as demand for chips to power data centers, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and gaming has surged. Nvidia said that ""320 companies involved in self-driving cars - whether software developers, automakers and their suppliers, sensor and mapping companies - are using Nvidia Drive, formerly branded as the Drive PX2,"" Reuters reports. The German bank is down seven percent the past two days after it said it would post a small loss for 2017, its third consecutive annual. Weak trading and a $1.8 billion hit from the United State's tax overhaul are the main culprits. Of those, Deutsche Bank's trading woes should be more concerning to shareholders, writes Christopher Thompson of Breakingviews. The bank said sales and trading revenue was expected to decline 22 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago. While Deutsche Bank's trading performance has not be appreciably worse than its European rivals, the decline in its shares ""is that it is more dependent on this revenue than other big investment banks."" ""Equities and fixed income sales and trading brought in more than 31 percent of Deutsche's total revenue in the third quarter of 2017, compared with around 28 percent at Credit Suisse and 19 percent at Barclays. The German group also lacks a consistent source of stable earnings similar to Credit Suisse's wealth management franchise or Barclays's UK retail bank."" That means that ""without a pickup in volatility or client activity, trading revenues – and shareholders – remain stuck in a rut,"" Mr. Thompson writes. Jason Rabinowitz of The Points Guy explained how John F. Kennedy International Airport in particular functions — and why its operations were severely disrupted even after the ""bomb cyclone"" of last week. Among the interesting pieces of trivia to emerge from the piece: Essentially, each terminal at JFK is its own little fiefdom with separate operations, management and employees. If an airline calls Terminal 7 home, that's the only terminal it's allowed to use. Even if Terminal 4 has a dozen empty gates, an airline slated for Terminal 7 may have to wait hours for a gate to open at Terminal 7. Here's Mr. Rabinowitz's concluding thought: Savvy travelers all know to avoid NYC area airports whenever possible, and this winter storm drove that point home once again. — Michael J. de la Merced Questions Brian Krzanich is likely to face about as he prepares for a keynote speech at the biggest convention in consumer electronics: • How well will planned fixes work against Meltdown and Spectre, the two computer chip security flaws that affect most of the world's processors? • Can Intel design new chips without either of the problems? • Were the $39 million worth of stock sales he made in November, after the flaws were discovered but before they were disclosed, really just part of a prearranged trading plan?

From the campaign's public letter to the tech titan: The only difference between the changes we are advocating at Apple now and the type of change shareholders are better known for advocating is the time period over which they will enhance and protect value. Who's helping Jana: The big California pension fund known as Calstrs. Also on board as advisers are the musician Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler; Sister Patricia Daly, a nun who took on Exxon Mobil over environmental issues; and Robert Eccles, a sustainability expert. The bigger picture: Jana is wading into corporate social responsibility, an area that Wall Street has only recently started dabbling in, the WSJ reports. Firms like TPG have raised social impact funds, but no major activist fund has started campaigns focused specifically on getting companies to act better from a social standpoint. He explains with some math in  this week's Time, guest-edited by Bill Gates: • America's population should grow by about 0.8 percent a year, between births and immigration. • Assuming annual gains in real GDP continue to be about 2 percent, that means the U.S. will deliver about 1.2 percent growth in per-capita GDP.

News,2018-01-09,A creator of the iPhone called the device “addictive.”,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/technology/apple-tech-children-jana-calstrs.html,1212," A creator of the iPhone called the device ""addictive."" A Twitter founder said the ""internet is broken."" An early Facebook investor raised questions about the social network's impact on children's brains. Now, two of the biggest investors on Wall Street have asked Apple to study the health effects of its products and to make it easier for parents to limit their children's use of iPhones and iPads. Once uncritically hailed for their innovation and economic success, Silicon Valley companies are under fire from all sides, facing calls to take more responsibility for their role in everything from election meddling and hate speech to physical health and internet addiction. ""Companies have a role to play in helping to address these issues,"" said Barry Rosenstein, managing partner of Jana Partners, an investment firm that wrote an open letter to Apple this weekend pushing it to look at its products' health effects, especially on children. ""As more and more founders of the biggest tech companies are acknowledging today, the days of just throwing technology out there and washing your hands of the potential impact are over."" The backlash against big tech has been growing for months. Facebook and Twitter are under scrutiny for their roles in enabling Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and for facilitating abusive behavior. Google was hit with a record antitrust fine in Europe for improperly exploiting its market power. But until now, Apple had escaped largely unscathed, and concerns about the deleterious effects of excessive technology use have not been among the most pressing matters for Silicon Valley executives. Jana, an activist hedge fund, wrote its letter with Calstrs, the California State Teachers' Retirement System, which manages the pensions of California's public-school teachers. When such investors pressure companies to change their behavior, it is typically with the goal of lifting a sagging stock price. In this case, Jana and Calstrs said they were trying to raise awareness about an issue they cared deeply about, adding that if Apple was proactive about making changes, it could help the business. ""We believe the long-term health of its youngest customers and the health of society, our economy and the company itself are inextricably linked,"" the investors said in the letter. Jana, which is often vilified for its aggressive focus on short-term profits, also said it would be raising a fund this year that would engage in more such campaigns, an effort that could help soften its image. Whatever the motivations, the two large investors are tapping into the growing anxiety among parents about their children's preoccupation with devices, at the expense of activities like reading and sports. ""Over the past 10 years, there's been a bottom-up backlash,"" said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of ""Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other."" ""You see it in things like people not sending their kids to schools that use iPads, and kids telling their parents to put their phones down."" For years, researchers have been sounding the alarm over the ubiquity of mobile phones and social media. A 2015 study by Common Sense Media, a research group that studies technology use, found that more than half of teenagers spent upward of four hours a day looking at screens, and that for a quarter of teenagers, the figure was more than eight hours. In another survey, in 2016, half the teenagers said they felt addicted to their mobile devices. ""These things can be incredibly addictive,"" said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped create the iPod and iPhone. ""It's amazing, but there are a lot of unintended consequences."" A growing roster of prominent technology executives have grown worried about the creations that brought them fame and fortune. Sean Parker, an early investor in Facebook, reflected on the sprawling influence of the social network. ""It literally changes your relationship with society, with each other,"" he said in an interview with Axios in November. ""It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains."" Evan Williams, one of the founders of Twitter, last year lamented the degree to which the messaging service had become a bastion for hateful speech. ""The internet is broken,"" he said. Chamath Palihapitiya, an early Facebook executive and the chief executive of Social Capital, a venture capital firm, said in November that he felt ""tremendous guilt"" about his role in building the social network. ""The short term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works,"" he said. ""No civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation, mistruth. And it's not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem."" By going after Apple, Jana and Calstrs, which together own about $2 billion worth of the company's stock, have selected the tech giant that is perhaps least dependent on its users' time. Because Apple makes most of its money selling hardware, rather than through digital advertising, it theoretically could afford to encourage its users to spend less time with its products. ""Apple's business model is not predicated on excessive use of your products,"" Jana and Calstrs said in their letter to the company. For this reason, said Ms. Turkle, the M.I.T. professor, ""it turns out that Apple is the company best positioned to act."" In a statement, Apple said that the parental controls already on its devices ""lead the industry"" and that ""we think deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them."" ""We take this responsibility very seriously,"" the statement continued, ""and we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations, especially when it comes to protecting kids."" Fears about technology addiction are not new. The BlackBerry, an early smartphone, was nicknamed ""CrackBerry."" Adam Alter, a social psychologist and the author of ""Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked,"" documents instances of internet addiction spanning the globe. But some tech executives now acknowledge that far from being an accident, their products were designed to be addictive. Mr. Parker said that when Facebook was getting started, the thought process was about ""how do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?"" Mr. Palihapitiya said as Facebook was rapidly growing, ""in the back, deep, deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen."" Mr. Fadell said that at the time Apple was designing the iPhone, ""we had no idea this was going to happen."" But, he added, people today are simply spending too much time looking at their phones. ""Now it needs to be addressed,"" he said. ""It's been 10 years in the making."" Even Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook and usually a staunch defender of his company's influence, has appeared more reflective in recent days. ""The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do — whether it's protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent,"" he said in a Facebook post last week. ""My personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues."""
News,2018-01-09,"WASHINGTON — With a booming speech at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday night, Oprah Winfrey, the billionaire media entrepreneur and former television talk-show host, launched a thousand fantasies for Democrats: Of a historic campaign to put a black woman in the White House. Of a celebrity candidate, known for her big-hearted optimism, taking on a reality-show president defined by his thirst for combat. Of a presidency, some joked, where everybody would get a car.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/us/politics/oprah-president-2020.html,1432," WASHINGTON — With a booming speech at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday night, Oprah Winfrey, the billionaire media entrepreneur and former television talk-show host, launched a thousand fantasies for Democrats: Of a historic campaign to put a black woman in the White House. Of a celebrity candidate, known for her big-hearted optimism, taking on a reality-show president defined by his thirst for combat. Of a presidency, some joked, where everybody would get a car. Ms. Winfrey's longtime partner, Stedman Graham, stoked the mood in a newspaper interview, suggesting to The Los Angeles Times that she would ""absolutely do it"" — with the caveat that such matters are ""up to the people."" There was no more official signal on Monday from Ms. Winfrey, 63, as to her interest in the presidency. She has disavowed any ambition to be a candidate in the past, though she has told associates in recent months that she wants to play a part in bringing the country together, two people briefed on her thinking said. If Ms. Winfrey's ambitions are unclear, the sometimes giddy reaction to her speech at a Hollywood awards dinner underscored the unfulfilled hunger among Democrats for a larger-than-life leader to challenge President Trump. With no obvious front-runner for the 2020 campaign, Democrats appear likely to spend the next few years grinding through internal disagreements over policy and identity in a long contest for the nomination. There are thorny disagreements in the party about how bluntly liberal its agenda should be, how boldly to confront Mr. Trump and how to balance the task of turning out core Democratic voters with the desire to win over disaffected Republicans and independents. In the imagination of some Democrats, Ms. Winfrey might offer an easy way out of those problems. She inspires crucial groups for the party — women and African-Americans — and alienates few. She has cast herself in American culture as an avatar of optimism, not defined in ideological terms. Having made a career out of preaching the values of empowerment and inclusion, she represents in some ways a natural counterpoint to Mr. Trump's proud pugilism. Senior Democrats in Washington said on Monday they had received no signal from Ms. Winfrey that she hoped to seek the White House. David Axelrod, the former chief strategist for Barack Obama, said Ms. Winfrey was a figure of unique political potential, with ""a boundless capacity for empathy and a preternatural ability to communicate powerfully and authentically — as we saw at the Golden Globes."" Mr. Axelrod questioned, however, whether Ms. Winfrey would be the right fit for 2020: ""Would she want to submit herself to the unforgiving, relentless and sometimes absurd process of running for president?"" he wondered, adding: ""Will there be hunger in 2020 for someone with some experience in government, after Trump?"" Some Democrats expressed skepticism and even frustration about the swirl of fascination with Ms. Winfrey, arguing that the party was jumping the gun with fevered speculation about 2020. Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a young liberal in the chamber, wrote tersely on Twitter: ""Hey. Let's focus on winning in 2018. Thanks."" Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist from the party's progressive wing, said it would be a mistake for Democrats to rush toward a magnetic personality rather than hashing out a compelling agenda for the midterm elections and beyond. ""Beating Trump isn't just about finding the right candidate — we have to show what we stand for,"" Ms. Katz said. ""Other than 'we all get a car,' what will an Oprah presidency look like?"" she added, referring to when Ms. Winfrey famously gave a car to every audience member at her show.  Ms. Winfrey's sudden prominence in the nation's political imagination speaks, in some respects, to the merging of politics and entertainment in the American mind. She has occupied a singular role in the television industry, parlaying roles as a local news anchor and a talk-show host in Chicago into a media empire that includes her own cable network and a fortune estimated at close to $3 billion. Gallup polling regularly finds Ms. Winfrey among the country's most admired women, alongside Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, suggested — with a dose of skepticism — that Ms. Winfrey was the kind of political outsider Democrats might embrace. Alluding to Mr. Trump's lack of experience, Ms. Pelosi tartly told a small group of reporters that Ms. Winfrey had other qualities going for her: ""Oprah has read books. She knows how to identify talent."" ""If we're going into a place where they are devaluing experience in terms of substance and legislative acumen and stuff like that,"" Ms. Pelosi said, ""you might as well have somebody who knows what they don't know and would get the best possible people there."" Ms. Winfrey's commercial reach transcends race and income level, analysts say, propelling so many books and products to overnight success that it has earned its own sobriquet: ""The Oprah Effect."" In 2015, Ms. Winfrey bought a 10 percent stake in Weight Watchers and assumed a position on the company's board, a move that instantly doubled the company's sluggish share price and added $400 million to its market value. Other investments have eluded that Midas touch. Ms. Winfrey's cable channel, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, a joint venture with Discovery Communications Inc., initially struggled to gain traction and last year earned an average of 462,000 prime time viewers daily. In December, Discovery said it would take majority control of OWN, purchasing 24.5 percent of the channel for $70 million from Ms. Winfrey's company, Harpo. Ms. Winfrey's most potent appeal, industry analysts say, is among somewhat older consumers — or perhaps, voters — with women over 55 as her strongest cohort. She is especially popular among African-American women and white suburban women, two groups Democrats will rely on in the 2018 and 2020 elections. By Monday afternoon, the White House had responded to the threat of Oprah in 2020. ""We welcome the challenge,"" said Hogan Gidley, a spokesman for the president, ""whether it be Oprah Winfrey or anybody else."" But Ms. Winfrey has approached politics cautiously over the years, engaging highly selectively. In 2007, she intervened for Mr. Obama, holding rallies for him and hailing him as ""the one."" And in 2013, she hosted a fund-raising event for Cory Booker, in his first bid for Senate in New Jersey. During the 2016 campaign, Ms. Winfrey endorsed Mrs. Clinton but never ventured onto the campaign trail. Though Ms. Winfrey and her staff discussed a possible appearance with the Clinton campaign, none was ever scheduled. Ms. Winfrey's aides cited her focus on righting her television network as the reason for her difficult schedule. Minyon Moore, a Clinton adviser who communicated with the Winfrey team, said the campaign had been ""delighted"" to have Ms. Winfrey's endorsement. Should Ms. Winfrey seek to assemble a campaign team for 2020, Ms. Moore said, ""I suspect she would have her pick."" Less certain is whether Ms. Winfrey could navigate the ideological pitfalls of a presidential campaign and give voice not just to broad themes, but actual policy prescriptions. While Ms. Winfrey has aligned herself generally with Democrats like Mr. Obama, her views on a range of issues from financial regulation to drone warfare are opaque. She drew criticism from the left last year after saying in an interview that she felt hopeful and believed Mr. Trump had been ""humbled"" after meeting with Mr. Obama during the presidential transition. Alixandria Lapp, a strategist helping lead Democrats' effort to retake the House, said the profile of a media mogul outsider would be an uncomfortable match for the party. ""I think it's highly unlikely that Democrats will ever nominate our own version of Donald Trump — a celebrity with no government experience — because our party tends to respect government and governing experience,"" Ms. Lapp said. Ms. Winfrey has recently taken on political topics as a special correspondent for CBS News's ""60 Minutes,"" including a segment on the country's political divisions and another on the use of solitary confinement in prisons. But even to close friends and admirers, the prospect of an Oprah 2020 race appeared far-fetched or impossible as recently as last year. After Mr. Trump's inauguration, when the traditional barriers to entry into presidential politics appeared to melt away, Ms. Winfrey's associates dismissed the idea. A reporter who last March contacted Ms. Winfrey's best friend, Gayle King of CBS News, got an emphatic reaction to the 2020 question. ""NOT A CHANCE!!!!!"" Ms. King replied at the time, adding: ""In caps for a reason."""
Review,2018-01-09,"A collage of female voices — including those of Michelle Obama and Barbara Walters — greets the audience arriving at Robert O’Hara’s new play, “Mankind.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/theater/review-mankind-robert-ohara-playwrights-horizons.html,951," A collage of female voices — including those of Michelle Obama and Barbara Walters — greets the audience arriving at Robert O'Hara's new play, ""Mankind."" Listen carefully, because that's the last you'll hear from anyone but men in the daring, daunting comedy, which opened at Playwrights Horizons on Monday evening. In Mr. O'Hara's not-too-distant future, women have gone extinct. Exactly how this happened is not clear, but a combination of environmental insults and anatomical over-regulation seems to have made women give up on the project of feminism — and the fact of femaleness — in a universal #NotMe moment. And though men quickly evolved to replace their procreative capacity, even the universal homosexuality that resulted has not made the survivors any less male. They still screw everything up. The plot takes that notion literally at first, as Jason (Bobby Moreno) announces to Mark (Anson Mount), with whom he's had a series of casual hookups, some bad news: ""Dude, I'm pregnant."" You may wish to know how, but neither Mr. O'Hara nor the characters seem clear on that point. (Both Jason and Mark, we learn, were on the pill.) In any case, the mutual recrimination over how the pregnancy happened soon resolves itself in an agreement to ""get rid of it"" — the baby, that is. Not so fast. In a reversal of the joke that if men gave birth, abortion would be a sacrament, the Big Brother-ish World Power Authority still outlaws pregnancy termination. After his OB-GYN rats him out, Jason is forced to deliver the ""Cry-Baby"" growing inside him by means of a machine that looks like an M.R.I. scanner crossed with a Keurig. But the child, which pops out pre-swaddled, is not what anyone expected. I won't spoil that part of the busy plot by saying more about the Cry-Baby, except that it somehow becomes, in this full-out patriarchy, the centerpiece of a new feminist religion. By intermission, Jason and Mark are that religion's unwilling high priests, wearing glittery robes and Ziegfeld headgear (by Dede M. Ayite) that would make a cardinal — the bird or the prelate — blush. You may blush, too, if you are a man who does not relish audience participation, as you will be asked to raise your voice in hymn to the ""most merciful Goddess."" (Women aren't given the prayer cards.) Unfortunately, the development of this woman-and-baby-worshiping cult hijacks what seemed to be a topical comedy of gender roles and drags it around for most of the second act. Religious ideology and professions of faith, especially Catholic ones, are lampooned as idiotic and venal, but the satire will likely infuriate traditional believers of any stripe. The first of the new Ten Commandments is ""Abortion is a human right."" I wasn't bothered by that: Surely religion is fair game for mockery. And no one should go to a Robert O'Hara play who isn't up for some trampling of sensitivities. Deliberate outrageousness is his métier, but he's an equal opportunity purveyor, eager to rile stray conservatives who venture into the theater, as well as their liberal antagonists. Actually, Mr. O'Hara has always reserved his most wicked blows for the liberals, puncturing their comfortable pieties and exposing their unexamined blind spots. In ""Barbecue,"" seen at the Public Theater in 2015, he let the audience laugh at the down-market doings of a white family picnic before continuing the same scene with a black family. In ""Bootycandy,"" an earlier satire of black theatrical tropes and the white people who love them, a stand-in character for the playwright tells audience members at a postshow talk back that he hopes they will ""choke"" trying to swallow what he's written. ""The work should be work,"" he says. But at their intermittent best those plays were so hilarious that the work was not work — or if work, then the highly pleasurable kind. Each had a defining gimmick that made it deliciously theatrical: a twist, Mr. O'Hara writes in a program note, ""that gives the play its Shout."" So does ""Mankind,"" in its triumph-of-the-patriarchy premise. The problem here is that the story keeps twisting even when you need it to stay put and shout. Another switcheroo arrives every few minutes, which quickly grows as tiresome as a joker roommate and lets the satire deflate into mere sarcasm. It's a problem of focus. Satire is about the sharpness of the darts but also of the targets. Here there are too many targets to leave a coherent impression. Religion seems to be the intended bull's-eye, and it's certainly instructive to see how the church of ""She"" (whose name is thought to be unpronounceable) grows into a grotesque expression of mansplained feminism. So is the way casual, catty utterances of Jason and Mark are misinterpreted by apostles and transformed into dogma. Mr. O'Hara also asks you to cackle about the vapidity of talk shows, the clichés of dystopian dialogue, bromosexuality, sexism, Trumpism and futurism itself. This pinwheel of snark feels like a stunt, and there's little that the cast — which also includes David Ryan Smith, Ariel Shafir, Stephen Schnetzer and André De Shields — can do, under the author's seemingly distracted direction, to keep a feeling of agitated desperation at bay. Their varying choices to play the material as serious drama or sketch comedy seem almost random. Mr. O'Hara has said that with satire, especially now, you can't go partway: ""You have to go for the throat."" That's probably true — and the viciousness of ""Mankind"" that would offend some people is perhaps its best quality. But when you go for too many throats at once, the result feels less like comedy than mayhem, and hasn't the patriarchy already shown us enough of that?"
Editorial,2018-01-09,Children from lower-income families could soon lose access to affordable health care because the Republican leaders in Congress have failed to renew the Children’s Health Insurance Program. This is a travesty.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/opinion/republicans-congress-chip-failing.html,538," Children from lower-income families could soon lose access to affordable health care because the Republican leaders in Congress have failed to renew the Children's Health Insurance Program. This is a travesty. After passing a lavish tax cut for corporations and wealthy families, Congress hastily left town last month without reauthorizing the federal-state health insurance program, which benefits nearly nine million children. Authorization expired in September, and so far states have kept CHIP going with unspent funds carried over from previous appropriations. Before Christmas, Congress allocated $2.85 billion to the program, saying that the money would take care of the children's needs until the end of March. But that appears to have been a gross miscalculation, because the Trump administration said on Friday that some states would start running out of money after Friday, Jan. 19. CHIP was created in 1997 and has helped halve the percentage of children who are uninsured. It has been reauthorized by bipartisan majorities of Congress in the past. But Republican leaders in Congress all but abandoned the program last fall and devoted their time to trying to pass an unpopular tax bill that will increase the federal debt by $1.8 trillion over the next decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis released last week. By contrast, CHIP costs the federal government roughly $14.5 billion a year, or $145 billion over 10 years. Republicans have held children's insurance hostage to force Democrats to accept cuts to other programs. Last year, House Republicans insisted that they would reauthorize CHIP only if Democrats agreed to offset spending on the program with cuts to Medicare and a public health program created by the Affordable Care Act. Democrats balked at those demands, given that Republicans did not bother to offset the loss of revenue from their boondoggle tax cuts. A deal between the two sides should theoretically be easier to reach now. That's because the C.B.O. said last week that reauthorizing CHIP would add just $800 million to the federal deficit over 10 years, much less than the $8.2 billion it had projected earlier. The budget office updated its estimates after the adoption of the tax law. That law will significantly reduce federal spending on health care by eliminating the requirement that people buy insurance, which many people do with the help of government subsidies. The budget office says that provision and a separate change to insurance regulations by the Trump administration will reduce the cost of insuring children. Yet funding for CHIP is still far from assured. Congress has a lot on its plate, chiefly passing a spending bill by the end this week to avoid a government shutdown. If Congress does not act on CHIP, state governments will be forced to freeze enrollment, cut benefits, end their programs or come up with another source of money. For some families, the program, which costs them nothing or very little, is essential. Losing it would be a big blow. Many cannot afford coverage in the private market. After meeting with Mr. Trump during the weekend at Camp David, Republican leaders suggested they wanted to work with Democrats on bipartisan legislation this year. If they are serious, they can start with CHIP. America's children are counting on it."
News,2018-01-09,"To millions of Americans, Bob Harper was the picture of health, a celebrity fitness trainer who whipped people into shape each week on the hit TV show “The Biggest Loser.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/well/heart-risk-doctors-lipoprotein.html,1061," To millions of Americans, Bob Harper was the picture of health, a celebrity fitness trainer who whipped people into shape each week on the hit TV show ""The Biggest Loser."" But last February, Mr. Harper, 52, suffered a massive heart attack at a New York City gym and went into cardiac arrest. He was saved by a bystander who administered CPR and a team of paramedics who rushed him to a hospital, where he spent two days in a coma. When he awoke, Mr. Harper was baffled, as were his doctors. His annual medical checkups had indicated he was in excellent health. How could this have happened to someone seemingly so healthy? The culprit, in turned out, was a fatty particle in the blood called lipoprotein(a). While doctors routinely test for other lipoproteins like HDL and LDL cholesterol, few test for lipoprotein(a), also known as lp(a), high levels of which triple the risk of having a heart attack or stroke at an early age. For most people, lp(a) is nothing to worry about. Levels are strongly determined by genetics and the majority of people produce very little of it. But up to one in five Americans, including Mr. Harper, have perilously high levels of it in their blood. Studies show that diet and exercise have almost no impact on lp(a), and cholesterol-lowering drugs only modestly lower it. ""People don't know about it, physicians don't know about it, and we have to get an education program out there, but that's expensive,"" said Dr. Henry N. Ginsberg, the Irving Professor of Medicine at Columbia University and a leading expert on lp(a). ""I would say that somewhere between 15 to 20 percent of the population would clearly benefit from knowing that this is their problem."" Lp(a) was discovered in 1963 by a Norwegian scientist, Kare Berg, who noticed that it was especially common among people with coronary heart disease. No one knows precisely what purpose lp(a) serves in the body, though some scientists speculate that it may have a beneficial role such as helping to repair injured cells or preventing infections by binding to pathogens in the blood. But the downside of excessive lp(a) is clear: It accelerates the formation of plaque in the arteries, and it promotes blood clots. ""It's sort of a double whammy,"" said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, a cardiologist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine who helped write the American Heart Association's cholesterol guidelines. ""Biologically, lp(a) both gets into the artery wall and causes damage there more easily."" Studies suggest that the threshold for high lp(a) begins around 30 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Heart disease risk jumps for those in the 80th percentile, with lp(a) levels above 60, and climbs sharply for the 5 percent of the population with lp(a) levels between 150 and 300, according to Dr. Ginsberg at Columbia. ""Those people can be disasters in terms of cardiovascular risk,"" he said. Yet many people at high risk do not fit the typical profile of a person with heart disease. Sandra Revill Tremulis was a health-conscious medical device executive who moonlighted as an aerobics instructor, followed a strict diet, and maintained 16 percent body fat, equivalent to that of an elite athlete. Her LDL and total cholesterol levels were low, and at age 39, her Framingham risk score, which gauges heart disease risk, put her odds of having a heart attack in her 40s at just 1 percent. But when she started experiencing extreme fatigue and struggled to finish her workouts, she went to an interventional cardiologist and asked for a thorough work-up — which revealed that she had a 95 percent blockage in one of her coronary arteries. ""I was imminent to have a widow-maker heart attack at age 39,"" she said. Further testing showed she had high lp(a), which she believes she inherited from her father, who died of a heart attack at age 50. Determined to raise awareness, Ms. Revill Tremulis started a nonprofit, the Lipoprotein(a) Foundation, and now travels the globe advocating for wider testing. ""Only a small percentage of physicians know about this,"" she said. ""The biggest challenge for patients is finding knowledgeable physicians who know about this and can help them."" Dr. Lloyd-Jones at Northwestern said that testing for lp(a) should be considered for people with early-onset cardiovascular disease — which means younger than age 50 for men and age 60 for women — or a strong family history of it. Since high lp(a) is hereditary, those who have it often have a parent, sibling or grandparent who suffered a premature heart attack or stroke. When one person has it, it's important to test other family members too. ""It's what we call cascade screening, looking for affected first-degree relatives,"" Dr. Lloyd-Jones said. Once high lp(a) is identified, doctors try to mitigate its effects by controlling other risk factors. They aggressively lower patients' LDL cholesterol, optimize their blood pressure and blood sugar, and strongly encourage healthy diet and exercise habits. Two medications, niacin and a class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, have been shown to modestly reduce lp(a) levels. But niacin, a B vitamin, has many side effects, and PCSK9 inhibitors, which are not approved for lp(a) lowering, are not usually covered by insurance for that purpose and can cost as much as $14,000 a year. At least one drug company, Akcea Therapeutics, a spinoff of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, is developing a drug specifically to combat lp(a), but the drug is still in mid-stage testing and it could be years before it reaches the market. Since his heart attack, Mr. Harper of ""The Biggest Loser"" has embarked on a newfound mission to raise awareness about heart disease and to urge people to get tested for lp(a). His days no longer revolve around intense and grueling workouts, he said. Instead he believes the key to being healthy is managing stress, getting proper sleep, eating a balanced diet and enjoying life because it could end at any moment, an approach he has outlined in his new book, ""The Super Carb Diet."" ""Being healthy is not about what you can do in the gym,"" Mr. Harper said. ""It's not about what you can do on the outside. It's what's going on in the inside. I really needed to find out what was going on with me, and that's what this did. It woke me up."""

Here's what you need to know: • In Nigeria, our reporter spoke to some of the 7,000 migrants who had been returned from Libya over the last year. They described appalling conditions in Libyan detention centers: Some spoke of beatings and sexual abuse. Some said they were made to dismember corpses and remove their bones. Nigeria's government faces a new challenge: what to do with the returnees. ""I'm angry because I'm back in this jobless country,"" one said. Separately, at least 64 people, including at least five children, drowned after their overcrowded rubber dinghy sank off the Libyan coast. Most of those aboard the vessel were from sub-Saharan Africa. _____ • Nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador will have to leave the United States after living there legally for more than a decade, the U.S. government said. It is the Trump administration's most consequential reversal of immigration policies to date. Meanwhile, President Trump's approval ratings continue to defy economic growth. They are among the worst of any first-term president since modern polling began. _____ • Robert Mueller, above, the special counsel investigating possible collusion with Russia in the 2016 presidential election, is said to be seeking to interview the president. No formal request has been made and no date has been set. We profiled the man behind the firm that compiled the notorious dossier of possible links between President Trump and Russia. His enemies are legion on both sides of the Russia divide. And here's our political reporter's verdict on ""Fire and Fury,"" the book that caused an uproar in the White House: It's plausible, but that doesn't mean it's all true. (We also collected reactions from across the political spectrum.) _____ • President Hassan Rouhani, center, of Iran lashed out at his hard-line opponents: ""One cannot force one's lifestyle on the future generations."" Mr. Rouhani expressed understanding for protesters who had taken to the streets across the country, and he pledged that access to social media services would be restored. Meanwhile, the country's top nuclear official said Iran might rethink its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency if President Trump left the 2015 nuclear accord. _____ • Italy is hardly the first country to force its grocery vendors to switch from plastic bags to biodegradable and compostable ones. But with national elections set for March 4, a new law that compels grocers to charge shoppers for the new bags immediately pushed all kinds of political buttons.

This year the shade is Ultra Violet. ""We wanted to pick something that brings hope and an uplifting message,"" the institute's director, Leatrice Eiseman, told The Times. In ancient times, purple dye was made from the mucus of sea snails in the Phoenician city of Tyre, in what is now Lebanon's Mediterranean coast. Because the color was difficult and expensive to produce, it became associated with power and royalty, from ancient Rome to the kingdoms of Europe. In the 1500s, Queen Elizabeth I decreed that only members of the royal family could wear the color. In 1856, a British chemist, William Henry Perkin, made the color more accessible when he accidentally created a purple dye while trying to concoct a treatment for malaria. More than 160 years later, a color that's rare in nature is about to have its moment. For more on the color purple, read on.

News,2018-01-09,"LONDON — Despite promises of reform and mounting losses, FIFA, world soccer’s governing body, paid members of its ruling council nearly $10 million last year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/sports/soccer/fifa-council-infantino-salaries.html,1230," LONDON — Despite promises of reform and mounting losses, FIFA, world soccer's governing body, paid members of its ruling council nearly $10 million last year. According to three people with direct knowledge of the payments, FIFA, a nonprofit organization, paid each of the elected representatives on its 37-member council $250,000 salaries, plus tens of thousands of dollars more in travel expenses, in 2017. The people asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to disclose the information before FIFA officially releases it in March. That level of compensation — for a council that is scheduled to meet only three times this year — far exceeds payments for similar work at some of the world's largest for-profit companies. It also appears to contradict the pledges, made repeatedly by FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, since his election in 2016, to restore the organization's credibility by implementing fiscal discipline. With the World Cup in Russia only months away, FIFA is entering a crucial period, as it tries to convince the fans, media partners and sponsors who make it a $1 billion-per-year operation that its culture has changed from the corrupt organization described in a series of indictments unsealed by United States prosecutors in 2015. With most of FIFA's top leaders ousted after those scandals, Infantino won a special election for the presidency in 2016, promising both to reform the organization and increase its annual payments to member associations. The continuing generosity that FIFA shows toward the members of its ruling council calls into question how serious it is about reforming itself, two and a half years after those indictments and reports of other secret payments to top executives toppled the Zurich-based organization's leadership, including its former President Sepp Blatter, his one-time heir apparent Michel Platini and Blatter's top deputy, Jérôme Valcke. ""There should be, especially for a nonprofit, some sort of justification for the sum,"" said Alexandra Wrage, president of the corporate governance adviser Trace International. Wrage previously advised FIFA about corporate governance reforms before quitting in 2013. She has since become one of the organization's loudest critics. ""I don't see the justification in the résumés, I don't see the justification in market pressure,"" Wrage said of the payments to the board members. ""It's hard to understand."" The FIFA Council replaced a previous 25-person executive committee, part of an effort by FIFA to reshape its top level of management after the arrests of some of its former executive committee members. FIFA's board is drawn from soccer's six regional confederations. In addition to their salaries, members receive additional $150 per diem payments as well as business-class travel and accommodation while attending FIFA meetings and events. According to the accounting firm KPMG, the average pay for executives who perform similar roles for Britain's top 100 listed companies is 60,000 pounds, or about $81,000. Lodestone Global, which helps firms to design boards of directors, stated in a report that analyzed 331 companies in 39 countries that nonexecutive directors for private companies of comparable size to FIFA should receive about $48,000 a year. In fact, the $250,000 base compensation for a FIFA Council seat represents a degree of belt-tightening. Previous members of the executive committee received at least $300,000 in annual pay and perks, including $500-per-day allowances and first-class air travel for them and their partners. The details of this year's salaries are expected to be made public when FIFA publishes its 2017 financial statement. The organization has taken a financial hit from its legal problems, accruing more than $100 million in legal fees during the past two years. It has also struggled to entice sponsors to attach their brands to the World Cup, a concern after a group of veteran sponsors decided not to renew their agreements. Last spring, FIFA announced a $369 million loss for 2016 and said it expected that number to climb higher in 2017. While it has grown in size, the influence of the governing board has diminished considerably since the days of the executive committee. That group had the power to make FIFA's most important decision: where to stage the World Cup. FIFA Council members do not have that privilege; instead, FIFA's full membership will vote on such matters moving forward. Infantino is making further plans to assign other major decisions to a seven-person group he will lead with the six regional confederation heads. Typically there is very little dissent at FIFA's board meetings, and council members rarely raise their voice during discussions, according to several current and former officials who have taken part in them. Resolutions are usually passed without a formal vote. Also, board members are more limited in their ability to secure perks and additional bonuses than they were in the past. FIFA has eliminated the pension plans it once paid to former executive committee members, and, unlike at the last World Cup in Brazil, its officials will not have 24-hour access to limousines in Russia. However, FIFA still falls well short of industry standards. On its website, it says that the council is ""a nonexecutive, supervisory and strategic body that sets the vision for FIFA and global football."" Yet nonexecutive board members of businesses the size of FIFA — which generates about $5.5 billion per four-year World Cup cycle — earn far less for their roles, according to surveys by some of the world's leading professional services companies. In fact, organizations like FIFA should not pay board members anything beyond their expenses, according to guidelines published by the National Council of Nonprofits, which is based in Washington. The council has argued that nonprofit board members should serve voluntarily and not benefit from their service. For example, the International Olympic Committee, another Swiss-based group that rivals FIFA for global prominence, pays executive board members and commission chairmen and chairwomen $900 a day when working or traveling on Olympic business. Asian soccer officials get $50,000 for serving on the board's confederation. Board members for Europe's soccer governing body, UEFA, reportedly receive $100,000 a year. Money has been a central feature in Infantino's rise to the top job at FIFA. In his successful election pitch, he promised a fourfold increase in development funds. But as he talked regularly about reform, Infantino last year forced out the former Portuguese politician he had hired to lead those governance reforms. The official, Miguel Maduro, said he lost his job when he resisted pressure to clear candidates backed by FIFA's leadership. ""There is a huge structural conflict of interest at the heart of FIFA: its leaders depend for their survival on those whom they ought to reform,"" Maduro wrote in an editorial written with two former colleagues who quit the FIFA governance committee he led to protest his removal. Infantino's 2017 salary and that of his deputy, the secretary general Fatma Samoura, also will be reported at the meeting in March. Infantino initially worked without a salary after describing as insulting an offer of $2 million — $1 million less than Blatter, his predecessor, had earned in his final year. Infantino later accepted $1.5 million for 2016, though FIFA agreed to restore a bonus component starting in 2017. The size of that bonus remains unclear. After the World Cup in Brazil, held a year before his ouster in 2015, Blatter was awarded a $12 million bonus. He had lined up a performance bonus in the same amount had he completed a successful 2015-19 presidential term."

News,2018-01-09,"WASHINGTON — In the wake of a deep economic crisis and a disappointingly slow recovery, a growing number of experts, including some Federal Reserve officials, say it is time for the Fed to consider a new approach to managing the economy.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/federal-reserve-inflation.html,1290," WASHINGTON — In the wake of a deep economic crisis and a disappointingly slow recovery, a growing number of experts, including some Federal Reserve officials, say it is time for the Fed to consider a new approach to managing the economy. Since the mid-1990s, the Fed has focused on keeping inflation slow and steady, at about 2 percent a year, in the belief that it was the best way to nurture economic growth and avoid painful downturns. Those pushing for a new approach do not agree on the best alternative — the ideas range from minor tweaks to tossing the current rule book — but there is broad agreement that the Fed should seize the moment now, before the next crisis hits. ""Monetary policy has not been as successful as we might like over the last decade,"" Christina Romer, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said this weekend at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Philadelphia. ""Now really is the time for every monetary economist to say, 'Is there something better?'"" The stakes are high: The Fed pursues its goals by raising and lowering borrowing costs to influence economic growth and stability. Effective management allows the economy to prosper: Employment grows, wages rise and people enjoy better standards of living. Mistakes cause recessions. The Fed has faced questions about its methods in the decade since the 2008 crisis, but in recent weeks, officials have shown a willingness to welcome the debate. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said it was time to talk about approach because the Fed is finally wrapping up its response to the last crisis, which entailed unprecedented steps to lower borrowing costs and get financial markets moving. ""The right timing of this debate is really now because the U.S. economy has fully recovered from this recession,"" Mr. Williams said. Patrick Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, told attendees at the economics gathering in Philadelphia that there was an urgent need for more and better research on the available alternatives. ""The most important issue on the table right now is that we need to consider the possibility of a new economic normal that forces us to re-evaluate our targets,"" he said. ""It is a question for the profession itself, and we do need people thinking about this."" The Fed's current approach is known as inflation targeting. It works in large part by training the public to expect a certain level of inflation, disciplining the pricing decisions of businesses and the wage demands of workers. It is, in other words, a self-fulfilling prophecy. The Fed announced in January 2012 that it would seek to keep inflation at a 2 percent annual pace, formalizing its implicit target since the mid-1990s. The rise of inflation targeting reflected a consensus among academics and policymakers that central banks did not have direct control over broader economic performance but did exercise direct control over inflation, and that keeping inflation low and stable was the best way to support growth. Most central banks in developed nations similarly target a low rate of inflation, taking the view that unpredictable increases in prices are economically disruptive. The European Central Bank, for example, aims to keep inflation ""below, but close to"" 2 percent. But the Fed's focus on inflation in the real economy did not prevent asset prices like mortgage-backed bonds from soaring to unsustainable heights before 2008, and concern about keeping inflation low limited the scope of its post-crisis stimulus campaign. Moreover, the combination of low inflation and modest growth has left the Fed with very little room to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates. During past downturns, the Fed lowered rates by an average of five percentage points. But the Fed's benchmark rate currently sits in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. That would make cutting the rate a less effective tool than in previous firefights. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's outgoing chairwoman, has emphasized that the Fed has other weapons in its arsenal. After 2008, the Fed bought large quantities of Treasuries and mortgage bonds and promised to keep interest rates low for years at a time, encouraging borrowing by businesses and consumers. Ms. Yellen is expected to be succeeded by Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor who is awaiting Senate confirmation as the next Fed chairman. Some outside economists say the Fed is putting a brave face on a bad situation. ""We are living in a singularly brittle context in which we do not have a basis for assuming that monetary policy will be able as rapidly as possible to lift us out of the next recession,"" said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary. The proposed alternatives to inflation targeting can be sorted into two categories. The first contains one simple idea: The Fed should permanently embrace higher inflation. The second is full of complicated ideas for temporarily embracing higher inflation during downturns. Olivier Blanchard, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who began his term as president of the American Economic Association at the Philadelphia meeting, said the choice of a 2 percent target had no particular economic logic to recommend it. Raising the target to 4 percent would give the Fed more room to operate without significantly larger economic costs, he said. Many economists, however, are wary of the simple solution. Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, has warned that the costs of dropping a new anchor would be significant. On Monday, at a Brookings Institution conference convened to discuss alternatives to the 2 percent target, Mr. Bernanke dismissed a 4 percent target as politically untenable. ""The Fed is not going to adopt a 4 percent inflation target,"" he said. ""It's just not going to happen."" But Mr. Bernanke has added his name to the list of those seeking an alternative to the current system. Last year, he proposed that the Fed should announce that it would temporarily tolerate higher inflation during future economic recoveries. A mechanized version of that idea, popular in some academic circles, would instruct the Fed to target an alternative economic measure, nominal gross domestic product, or N.G.D.P., which sums inflation and real economic growth. Under a 4 percent N.G.D.P. target, for example, the Fed would aim for a combination of inflation and growth that equaled 4 percent, such as 2 percent inflation and 2 percent growth. During a period of lower inflation, like the last decade, such a target would require the Fed to dictate more aggressive stimulus. Some are skeptical that the Fed can improve the economy by trying harder. Atif Mian, an economist at Princeton University, has argued in his research that high levels of household debt are limiting the impact of monetary policy because many households cannot or will not continue borrow. ""There is this implicit assumption that things will have traction if you just push hard enough,"" Mr. Mian said. ""But what is the mechanism through which this will raise actual G.D.P.?"" Indeed, the Fed and other central banks have not even succeeded in hitting their 2 percent targets in recent years, for reasons that remain unclear. Inflation in the United States has been below that level for the last six years, although most Fed policymakers continue to predict that higher inflation is around the corner. Ms. Romer said more ambitious targets might encourage central banks to try harder to stimulate inflation. In practice, she said, the Fed could have purchased more Treasuries and mortgage bonds as part of its response to the crisis, or even engaged in direct lending to businesses. ""We should not just assume that what we've done for the last 25 years is right,"" she said."

One designed, mainly, by and for straight white men: the fruit of the ""male gaze"" that the film theorist Laura Mulvey described in 1975, which ""projects its fantasy on to the female figure, which is styled accordingly."" People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive has always been less beholden to the bold strokes of bodily divinity. Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford: It's their faces that have occupied each cover, not their bodies. The most recent winner, the country musician Blake Shelton, was an aw-shucks vision of the homespun white American male: plaid and beer and love handles, the kind of guy whose response to his win was ""Y'all must be running out of people."" When his selection was announced in the fall, many women shared that perspective — and mobilized, offering ""sexy"" alternates in lighthearted protest. The issue wasn't how Shelton looked so much as how he presented: as the Everyman, prized not in spite of his everyday appearance but because of it. (As Entertainment Weekly's Dana Schwartz tweeted, ""Blake Shelton is, at best, the sexiest divorced dad at this barbecue."") The consensus replacements were the actors Idris Elba and Mahershala Ali, each more conventionally attractive, each also black. Other suggestions included Taika Waititi (sartorially exceptional, Maori) and Jeff Goldblum (charming, eccentric, 65 years old). These women were laying their own claim to ""sexy,"" an adjective that — amid an endless stream of reports about sexual assault and harassment — has more often been wielded as a weapon. See, for instance, Roger Ailes, the former chairman of Fox News, reportedly telling Megyn Kelly that he wished to see her in the ""very sexy bras"" he assumed she possessed. For certain men, ""sexy"" means sex. It is not the human being; it is the human body. The women exuberantly rejecting Shelton were declaring: We are the subject, not the object. We'll decide what's ""sexy."" Originally, that which was ""sexy"" merely contained sex. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the word back to the British author Arnold Bennett and an 1896 letter about a work of art deemed too ""seksy"" to display. (Spelling aside, the word offered a much sleeker substitute for ""sexful,"" which appeared in print two years earlier.) Impregnating material with sexuality would soon prove itself a potent tool for advertisers. A landmark 1911 ad for Woodbury's Facial Soap Company featured a man caressing a woman in a low-cut dress, with the tagline ""A skin you love to touch."" Five years later, the ballerina Flores Revalles was front-page news after being photographed at the Bronx Zoo in a form-fitting gown with a snake coiled around her — her beauty, the story went, had tamed it. The soap ad was conceived by the influential executive Helen Lansdowne; the snake stunt came from Edward Bernays, ""the father of public relations,"" who claimed in his 1928 book ""Propaganda"" that ""human desires are the steam which makes the social machine work."" Having seen how images could be used for mass manipulation, Bernays proposed to maintain social order by sublimating individuals' irrational impulses into capitalist consumption. Women's desire to be autonomous, for instance, could be turned into a desire to buy smokes. ""More women now do the same work as men do,"" the psychoanalyst A.A. Brill told him. ""Cigarettes, which are equated with men, become torches of freedom."" And actual lust, it turned out, could be made almost indistinguishable from the lust for new products and new experiences. In 1950, the columnist Walter Winchell noted that producers of a show called ""Fire Island, New York"" worried their title ""wouldn't sound sexy enough."" It was one of the earliest cases of a slippage that has only grown, to the point where almost anything with a little extra oomph can be described as sexy — from a sexy new sports car to a sexy new legislative proposal. In the 1970s, a print ad for a Penril modem described the device as ""versatile, dependable, compatible (maybe even sexy)."" Because it's hard to find the sensual side of a box, a woman in go-go boots served as a visual reminder. ""Sexy,"" more than anything, designates whatever we wish to acquire and consume, whether it's an auto body or a human one. According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the first person identified as sexy was the silent film star Rudolph Valentino. His character the Sheik, based on an Edith Maude Hull fantasy, was marketed as ""the greatest lover that ever lived"" — an exotic dandy with the passion to ravish even a white aristocrat. Valentino occupied an ambiguous space, with his masculinity, sexuality and race all intriguingly fluid. The layman could not keep up. In 1922, the cartoonist Dick Dorgan made fun of Valentino's superiority in a Photoplay editorial: ""I hate him because he's too good looking,"" he wrote. ""The women are all dizzy over him."" By the middle of the century, ""sexy"" had landed on stars like Marilyn Monroe. It was feminine, one-dimensional and not at all ambiguous — the woman as Venus. Valentino's image was more powerful for his silence; Monroe's was the opposite, boosted by her dumb-blonde act and baby-doll voice. Who better to appear on the first cover of Playboy, the official Entertainment for Men? ""She was the fifties' fiction,"" wrote the film critic Molly Haskell in 1974 — ""the lie that a woman has no sexual needs, that she is there to cater to, or enhance, a man's needs."" This was not how women saw themselves. ""What is a sexy woman?"" Helen Gurley Brown asked in ""Sex and the Single Girl"" in 1962. ""Very simple. She is a woman who enjoys sex."" When Brown became the editor of Cosmopolitan, she delivered sex to women the same way Playboy did to men, with characteristic cover lines like ""What's Most Sexy About Men"" and ""Are You Sexy?"" This was meant as an empowering alternative to the images found elsewhere, but its rapprochement of women and sex also wound up transforming both into one commodity. Sexy women were for sale: Women with enough money could be them, and men with enough money could have them. You, too, could be a modern woman, but only if you put in the man hours between the sheets. Even in the hands of women, ""sexy"" was still wrapped in the embrace of the market. In 1972, Cosmopolitan presented its first male centerfold: a furry Burt Reynolds, reclining nude on an equally furry rug. And yet ""sexy"" would continue, in the main, to be defined by the male gaze, filtered through a consumer market dominated by men, most of them white. Its images were predictable; its attainment directly proportional to buying power and never fully achieved. ""Ads do not sell sex — that would be counterproductive, if it meant that heterosexual women and men turned to one another and were gratified,"" Naomi Wolf wrote in ""The Beauty Myth"" in 1990. ""What they sell is sexual discontent."" The market trades particularly on women's dissatisfaction with themselves, reducing them to objects of allure that can always be improved with the purchase of a new lipstick. A sexy woman thus becomes bait — a line of thinking that, among this fall's stories of predation, prompted several remarkable opinions. The designer Donna Karan wondered: ""Are we asking for it by presenting all the sensuality and sexuality?"" When the market holds both that women should aspire to be sexy and that a sexy woman equals sex, the moment a woman chafes at sexual attention is seen, to some, as a problem of her own making. After more than 120 years of use, ""sexy"" resists overnight reconstruction. We may try to chip away at Venus's stone curves, but the transformation is slow and complex. Women can lay their claim to it — Gurley Brown, Lansdowne, swooning Valentino fans — but a tradition of objectification persists. The women cheerily replacing Blake Shelton were reframing sexiness, but only very slightly; their choices still adhered to an obstinate commercial ideal. We can imagine deifying different bodies or a wider variety of them; we might even imagine a post-gaze society, where we lust after personality and spirit rather than external appearance. But all of this would require reimagining centuries of culture — and reconfiguring the billions of dollars of powerful market forces built atop them."
