Op-Ed,2018-01-01,President Trump is vowing to return to two of his favorite goals in 2018: a crackdown on immigration and the dissolution of the Affordable Care Act.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/opinion/tom-brokaw-health-care-immigrants.html,747," President Trump is vowing to return to two of his favorite goals in 2018: a crackdown on immigration and the dissolution of the Affordable Care Act. When congressional Republicans passed the sweeping tax bill in December, they eliminated the A.C.A.'s health care mandate. But President Trump wants to knock out the entire program. As I have learned in the past four years, immigration and health care in America have an organic relationship that may escape the president and his supporters if they experience health care only from the outside looking in. I've been an active pilgrim in our medical culture, as a cancer patient, a kidney stone carrier, a victim of a mysterious vertigo condition and the owner of a battered elbow resulting from a hard fall on a New York City street. What I've learned is that American health care is a universe of scientific genius and selfless compassion populated by what seems to be the most diverse population in the country. Spinal surgeons of Russian origin and American training, Ecuadorean eye specialists, Chinese imaging experts, Kazakh physical therapists, East Indian oncologists and an elegant orthopedist from Bologna (we traded New York Italian restaurant recommendations) — I've met them all. It is not just New York hospitals that are an ethnic ""purée,"" as an Argentine nurse at Sloan Kettering described the mix to me. Most large metropolitan hospitals are staffed by dedicated workers from just about every continent. Rural American patients welcome well-trained Pakistani and East Indian physicians in private practice and small-town clinics. In the middle of white-bread Minnesota you'll see employees of the Mayo Clinic scurrying through the corridors in Muslim head scarves and Sikh turbans. I was consulting with a Nebraska-born neurologist, the son of a grain elevator operator, while a Mayo-trained Kenyan émigré expertly drew my blood. The diversity of our health care system isn't just about immigrants. In rural America, homegrown physicians worry that their commitment to small communities is being severely tested by hospital consolidations. In Powell, Wyo., I met a doctor, Nathaniel Rieb, the son of a Presbyterian minister, who is the only general surgeon in the town hospital. He stays because if he leaves, then what? Nathaniel and his wife have five children, including one severely disabled by multiple sclerosis. They met him on a mercy mission to Haiti and immediately made him part of their family. I left our encounter thinking, ""I'd like to be Nathaniel's patient and his neighbor."" One of Nathaniel's female colleagues is equally dedicated to rural medical care, especially for women. She has yet to hear much discussion of the different health care needs based on gender in the Affordable Care Act debate. My professional and personal curiosity prompts me to inquire how physicians choose their specialty. The gifted Montana trauma surgeon who expertly repaired my wife's shattered ankle explained that his father was a carpenter, so he grew up liking to fix things. My friend the writer Tom McGuane is taken with the back story of Dr. Doug Packer, one of the world's leading electrophysiologists. He rewires damaged hearts. Dr. Packer explained that his family had an auto business and at an early age he liked to tinker with the electrical systems in cars. He took that passion to Brigham Young University, the Duke Medical School and eventually the Mayo Clinic. Our eldest daughter set out to be an infectious disease physician but a season working with female Afghan refugees on the Pakistan border before medical school changed her mind. She became an emergency room doctor because she treasured interacting with patients in immediate care. As a nation, we have major political, financial and medical challenges ahead in re-organizing the 20 percent of the economy that health care represents. And, as I've learned, America remains a cherished destination for gifted and motivated physicians, researchers, nurses, stretcher bearers and wheelchair attendants from around the world. They're on the front lines around the clock, an up-close and personal experience that is critical to this monumental task. Those gifted care givers come in many colors from a rich palette of backgrounds. Their world is on a 24-hour cycle of critical decisions, complicated procedures, tender care and emotional exhaustion. We're lucky to have them. They deserve to be heard not just by their grateful patients. When the president's emissaries meet with Congress and the insurance and pharmaceutical industries to negotiate health care, our care givers, in all their diverse and compassionate glory, should be there too."
Letter,2018-01-01,To the Editor:,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/opinion/amtrak-derailment.html,330," To the Editor: Re ""Derailed Infrastructure"" (editorial, Dec. 25): The rail tragedy near Tacoma, Wash., was preventable. Why did it happen? Congress is the primary culprit. For many decades, it has appropriated billions to develop, implement and operate our air traffic control system, and it has spent even more trying to make an inherently unsafe mode of transportation — highways — a little less unsafe. But railways are essentially told to ""fix the problem with your own dollars."" Railroads in Europe began to focus on ""crash avoidance"" back in the 1930s, and today most rail systems throughout the world manage to prevent such accidents. In Japan, the high-speed Shinkansen system has operated since 1964 without a single significant-injury accident. In the United States, we pay far too little attention to crash avoidance. Congress and the Federal Railroad Administration are responsible. And the media is guilty of failing to educate. DAN MCFARLING, ALOHA, ORE. The writer is a director of the Association of Oregon Rail and Transit Advocates, a rail passenger association. To the Editor: The recent Amtrak accident may indeed provoke renewed concerns about the state of America's infrastructure. It also underscores the deficiencies in funding, which is necessary to maintain and upgrade the country's aging transportation systems. There are a number of reasons for this deficiency. Primary among them is the nature of our market economy. It favors new products and services that make old ones obsolete and can create large investment returns in relatively short order. That is why government is so central to infrastructure investment; it can override financial market considerations. American capital markets don't like investing in old businesses (except perhaps real estate) unless there is a new twist. Automation could be such a twist. Perhaps new technologies involving driverless cars (and eventually pilotless airplanes) will find their way into mainstream rail applications and generate the investment interest necessary to support broader rail modernization.

Most markets around the world will be closed on Monday, as traders get an extra day of rest. Across much of the United States, 2018 will begin with a continuation of unusually cold temperatures, according to the National Weather Service. Zach Wichter SMALL BUSINESS On Monday, recreational marijuana will become legal in California, the eighth state to legalize the drug. But because marijuana still does not have legal standing with the federal government, it can be difficult for marijuana start-ups to get funding from banks, or generally to conduct business as usual. Zach Wichter ECONOMY The Federal Reserve was full of optimism at the end of 2017. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate at its final meeting of the year and issued a revised economic forecast predicting faster growth in 2018, citing the effects of a major federal tax cut. The Fed also said it did not anticipate raising interest rates more quickly in response to faster growth. The question is why the Fed is willing to let the good times roll. The minutes of the December meeting, which the Fed is scheduled to release on Wednesday, may provide some answers. Binyamin Appelbaum  The Bureau of Labor Statistics is likely to report another month of strong job gains on Friday, when it releases December's data. It is too early to notice the effect of the new tax law, but economists expect that the unemployment rate will hold steady at 4.1 percent. Natalie Kitroeff"
News,2018-01-01,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — As he walked down the red carpet to begin his New Year’s Eve celebrations Sunday night, President Trump stopped to predict “a tremendous year” ahead.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/us/politics/trump-new-years-eve-mar-a-lago.html,1082," WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — As he walked down the red carpet to begin his New Year's Eve celebrations Sunday night, President Trump stopped to predict ""a tremendous year"" ahead. It certainly appeared to be getting off to a lavish start at his Mar-a-Lago club. Before the president arrived — flanked by his 11-year-old son, Barron, and his wife, Melania — a string of guests decked out in jewels, fur and sequins had already streamed in, having paid hundreds of dollars each to celebrate with the president and his family. But for all the opulence of the annual gala, it was also something else for Mr. Trump: familiar. He has been ringing in the new year at Mar-a-Lago for more than a decade, surrounded by his private club members in the glittering halls of the renovated home of the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post. It was perhaps the fitting culmination of 10 days of vacation firmly rooted in old routines: days at his golf course, nights at Mar-a-Lago, and a smattering of Twitter posts and meetings punctuating the moments in between. ""Donald Trump knows that he will not be measured on how much time he spent here,"" said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime confidant. ""He will be measured on the results, and be judged on how the economy has done and how he's protected the security of the country."" He is certainly not the first president to indulge in multiple days of golf or evade the press pool that trails him in white vans. And he and Melania Trump, the first lady, did have breaks from the routine. They made phone calls to military members stationed overseas, spoke on the phone with children tracking Santa Claus, attended evening Mass on Christmas Eve and visited a local fire station. But Mr. Trump's pattern of private phone calls and meetings, golf course mornings and private club evenings appeared far more relaxed than the vacation habits of his immediate predecessor, Barack Obama, who in 2015 spent a day crisscrossing a Hawaiian island to socialize with family and friends, go to the beach with his daughters and visit his grandfather's grave. And compared with the explosive news announcements that often drove coverage during his predecessor's Christmas vacations — implementing sanctions against North Korea in late 2014, and last year, retaliating against Russia for its meddling in the presidential election — the news this time has been fueled primarily by Mr. Trump's words instead of his actions. When asked Sunday night about the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's assertion that he has a nuclear button on his desk, the president said: ""We'll see. We'll see."" Before the celebration on Sunday, the president jabbed at some of his favorite targets even amid his holiday Twitter greetings as he wished ""friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year."" Here at Mar-a-Lago, the property the president refers to as the ""winter White House,"" Mr. Trump is often without aides and at home among his people, mingling and tweeting. This trip, he also had previously unannounced meetings and phone calls with a variety of professional golfers and politicians, including Gov. Rick Scott of Florida. He also opened up to people outside his usual circle. On Thursday, Mr. Trump sat down for 30 minutes with a New York Times reporter who approached him in the middle of lunch at the Trump International Golf Club. And on Saturday, Mr. Trump reached out to a group he affectionately refers to as his ""bridge people"" — the clump of supporters who religiously gather on the bridge corner near Mar-a-Lago every day they know the president is there. After the motorcade passed by, with Mr. Trump flashing a wide grin and two thumbs up through the window, two cars with Secret Service members circled back. They passed out flag pins and swept about 16 people back to the club. ""He's a classic extrovert,"" Mr. Ruddy said, adding that the people Mr. Trump sees at Mar-a-Lago are the ones he feels most connected to. ""He'll ask everyone their opinion, from the guys parking the car to the sommelier."" On Saturday, Mr. Trump, in a gray sweater and white U.S.A. hat, chatted with the so-called bridge people by the pool, posing for pictures and complimenting the beauty of the people who came and their Trump paraphernalia. They were also given a tour of Mar-a-Lago, including the Trump-branded helicopter parked on a helipad intended for presidential business, and a buffet spread with meatballs, fresh fruit and chocolate chip cookies. ""It was an honor to be chosen by the most powerful man in the world, to be chosen to go to his home,"" said Nicolas Giacalone, 14, a Palm Beach resident who started coming to the street corner last month to show his support for Mr. Trump. ""He's a really nice guy."" On Sunday night, though, guests needed tickets for a four-course meal featuring the Trump iceberg wedge salad (with his trademark Roquefort dressing), Maine lobster ravioli, pan-seared sea bass and sliced tenderloin, and baked alaska. Guests crossed a lengthy red carpet with champagne flutes and martini glasses in their hands to get to the ballroom doors. In a nod to the brisk 60-degree Florida weather and the time of year, many women wrapped themselves in fluffy white and black fur stoles, some trailing down to the floor. Among them: Louise Linton, who arrived with her husband, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in a white fur capelet. ""Great year,"" Mr. Mnuchin said of the coming 12 months. ""Big year!"" Mr. Trump's elder daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrived with two of their children. They were soon followed by Mr. Trump's sons Eric, who arrived with his wife, Lara, and Donald Trump Jr., who brought one of his sons. The Fox Business host Lou Dobbs and the former New York Mets first baseman Keith Hernandez also joined the celebration. ""It's a very exciting evening,"" said Steve Levine, co-owner of Jose Graterol Designs, a South Florida design studio that fashioned the gala for the fourth time. He described this year's theme as an ""elegant, modern fantasy garden,"" brought to life through dozens of five-foot-long white, cream and silver roses suspended from the ceiling, a metallic color scheme, and sequined and velvet table linens and chairs. Inside the ballroom, the president found himself happily surrounded: A crowd of guests, breaking into applause and cheers, raised their cellphones to capture him shaking hands."
News,2018-01-01,"LONDON — Victoria Alvarez is a ball of energy, darting around the Seven Sisters Indoor Market in north London.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/world/europe/london-tottenham-regeneration.html,1060," LONDON — Victoria Alvarez is a ball of energy, darting around the Seven Sisters Indoor Market in north London. On a recent morning, she broke away from chatting with a friend to burst into a general store in the market, asking its Iranian owner if he had some supplies she needed. She barely had time to hear his response before she was off again, standing behind the counter at her currency exchange and parcel shipping stall. In a brief quiet spell, when her husband took over, Ms. Alvarez walked across the hall to one of the market's hairdressers for a blow-dry. For Ms. Alvarez, a Colombia native who has had a stall here for 16 years and is president of a traders' association, the market is a second home. Customers can shop for groceries, get a bite to eat or a haircut, meet a real estate agent and get legal advice, all under one roof. Her daughter spent much of her youth in its hallways. ""To me, my roots are very important,"" she said. ""This is why this market is such an important part of the community."" Now, she says Seven Sisters Indoor Market — the biggest Latin American market in England, by its estimation — is under threat, caught in one of London's largest ever redevelopment programs. Traders say that they are being priced out, that local officials are riding roughshod over their complaints, and that a hub for the British capital's Spanish-speaking minority will be lost. The district surrounding the market, Tottenham, is one of London's most diverse, with more than 200 languages spoken in the area. It is centered on High Road, a three-mile stretch that is home to shops like halal butchers and Afro-Caribbean hairdressers, as well as small cafes, restaurants and markets like the one where Ms. Alvarez works. Tottenham is also one of London's most deprived districts, and the local council argues that it is in dire need of renewal. More than 10,000 people are on a waiting list for public housing. Measures of crime are higher than the London average. And proponents of the regeneration point to the 2011 London riots, which started in Tottenham, as evidence that the area's problems must be addressed. Like many poorer parts of London, the neighborhood also sits uncomfortably beside wealthy districts. People who live on the west side of Haringey, the council of which Tottenham is a part, live about nine years longer than those in the east. Students who live in the west typically perform better academically, and household incomes there are up to twice as high. The situation — with uncomfortable parallels to Grenfell Tower, the public housing block that was consumed by fire last June and that lay close to multimillion-pound homes — offers a window into the challenges facing London, a dynamic city with a strong economy, but one with a housing shortfall and which many residents can no longer afford. ""There is no place in London that is not experiencing these pressures,"" said Mark Brearley, a professor at London Metropolitan University's Cass Cities program. ""Tottenham is an illustration of a London-wide phenomenon."" If all goes to plan, though, that will soon change — and while those behind the plans hope to improve the area's prospects, many here fear being pushed out. A raft of projects are underway. The local Premier League soccer club, Tottenham Hotspur, is carrying out a 750-million pound, or $1 billion, stadium upgrade. Train and subway stations are being renovated, schools and health services upgraded, and around 10,000 new homes are being added. The Seven Sisters Indoor Market will be rebuilt. ""It is ambitious,"" said Alan Strickland, the local council member responsible for regeneration. ""The scale of the challenge is very big."" The market's traders — largely Colombian, but also from Peru, Ecuador, Brazil and parts of Africa — will be moved across the street in 2020 while the market is being upgraded. Then, a couple of years later, they will have the option to move back, according to the local council and Grainger, the company in charge of the development. Grainger acknowledges that some traders' rents will go up, but insists that they will be more affordable than those available on the open market. It has promised to hold rent increases to 2 percent for five years from 2020. Ms. Alvarez, 47, has led efforts to oppose the moves. She and her colleagues want stronger guarantees of rent control, more financial compensation and greater clarity about the plans. They have taken the fight to Britain's courts, and even got the United Nations human rights body to weigh in on their side. Many other locals also oppose the changes, which they disparagingly call gentrification. Farther along the High Road, the twin brothers who run Chick King, a fried chicken restaurant, are worried. Their small eatery has sat directly opposite the soccer stadium since they opened in 1981. But their cafe, along with a string of houses and shops, faces demolition to make way for a walkway connecting the stadium to a soon-to-be-redeveloped train station. ""The community wanted to see improvements,"" said Alex Tryfonos, one of the brothers, ""but not wholesale demolition of the area."" He agreed that Tottenham needed the new investment, and the jobs associated with it. But he and other business owners worry that the redevelopment will mean either being forcibly removed — an official report after the riots advocated having fewer, and larger, shops and restaurants — or being priced out. ""I'm not opposed to change,"" said Susan Nguyen, whose nail salon is a few doors down from Chick King, before adding: ""I would be heartbroken if I had to leave the area."" Mr. Strickland insisted that the plans would have a positive effect on Tottenham, and that there had been wide consultation with locals. And he said some of the factors at play, like London's sky-high property prices, were out of the local authority's control. Yet for Ms. Alvarez, the changes in the district are irreparably altering its distinct character and culture. Sitting down above a beauty salon to catch her breath, she said that when her fellow traders asked her what she thinks will happen, she was often at a loss for words. ""I cannot tell them that I can see the future so grim sometimes,"" she said. ""But sometimes I do. And I cry."""

Her women seek transcendence in exertion. They go for runs, scan the woods for bike trails, consult personal trainers. In her first book, a mesmerizing collection of stories titled ""I Want to Show You More"" (2013), running was so intensely evoked that Runner's World magazine dispatched a profile writer to the author's home. Exercise isn't the only thing in Quatro's work that's vivid. She writes about infidelity and Catholicism, about married women who long to transgress and often do. Her first book was hot to the touch for its divine, earthly and intellectual acuities. Reading it, you felt echoes of Flannery O'Connor and Graham Greene. You also felt: This writer, born in San Diego and now living in Georgia, is constructing a new skyscraper on the literary horizon. Quatro is here now with ""Fire Sermon,"" her second book and first novel. It's a disappointment. At best it's a holding pattern. Once again the protagonist is a married woman in a sexually dead marriage. She questions her faith; she works out; she falls into an affair with a man in another city. ""Fire Sermon"" is, in other words, one of Quatro's short stories extended to novel length. Yet somehow this saga lacks a novel's amplitude. The narrator, Maggie, is a writer. Even she seems aware that this thin if fervid book brings little that's fresh to the theme of illicit sexual desire. At one point Maggie says, ""I imagine writing all this down and giving the manuscript to my agent."" She imagines her bored agent replying, ""This has been done to death."" And: ""I won't be able to sell this."" Maggie and her lover, James, are close to insufferable. He's a formalist poet who has the words ""sight"" and ""vision"" tattooed on alternate wrists. His poems, written in ""hyper-regular iambic meter,"" investigate ""the apocalyptic suffering created by a market economy."" She's a woman who grew up lovely and happy and sheltered. As an adult this happiness is given a booster shot: She inherits a million dollars from a rich uncle. She became a writer after abandoning an academic career, including an unwritten dissertation on ""postcolonial reinterpretations of the Genesis story."" Her husband is an agnostic. She is starved for religious talk. Maggie and James are both 45; their children have all left for college. The adulterous couple share a peanut allergy and a fondness for the Christian mystics and ""Moby-Dick."" They have ecstatic, guilt-ridden sex in a far-flung hotel room. As James Dickey told us in one of his poems: ""guilt is magical."" For these lovers, foreplay includes dialogue like, ""Do you read much apophatic literature?"" Maggie conflates sexual and religious desire, sometimes to memorable effect. More often, these meditations set off the pretentiousness alarm that rests, like a smoke detector, at the top of one's mind. You may finally have to cover the thing with plastic wrap and a rubber band. During sex with James, she reports how ""at the deepest point of penetration the room fell away and the sky tore open and we were swept up into electric galaxies."" This sounds less like one of Erica Jong's zipless romps than technical plans still on Elon Musk's drafting table. ""Balanced on this precipice we could blow open eternity,"" Maggie thinks as she and James consider having sex. Their lives will ""explode outward in a single, effortless, life-changing orgasm."" Indeed there are so many sexual and pre-sexual explosions that reading this book is like learning about one of the terrible disasters that result when a blaze starts in a fireworks store. The tortured intensity of Maggie's longing does remind the reader of what's lost when sex is unhitched from religion. Young lovers now ""hook up,"" a healthy phrase, if as wan as a piece of Dover sole. How many will know the illicit black-mass pleasures suggested by a word like fornication? And what of Thomas, Maggie's husband? He's a good father, we are told, and handsome. He reminds an acquaintance of Maggie's of the actor Patrick Dempsey. But this McDreamy is in finance and, as Maggie writes to James in an email, ""I find the language of business inaccessible."" Thomas is frustrated by the couple's bed-death, but you understand why he turns Maggie off. He is terrible at taking hints. Early in the novel he hopes to rekindle passion by giving Maggie a flesh-colored vibrator that's ""realistic-looking, veined and arched, a switch at its base."" She despises it. Before long he's shyly back with a ""tiny pink pebble vibrator"" that's ""shaped like a kidney bean."" She resents this one, too. Finally, incredibly, he returns with a long sleek silver dildo in a drawstring bag. ""Tell me that isn't what I think,"" she says. Maggie can't believe it. Neither can the reader. We start to wonder if Thomas will next burst into the house on a giant inflatable penis like the one Mick Jagger rode onstage during the Rolling Stones' 1975 tour. Quatro made compression work for her in the stories collected in ""I Want to Show You More."" In her first novel, more is less. Her themes expand but don't noticeably take on grain or deepen. Maggie is among those people who carry their faith not like a shawl worn around the shoulders but like something heavy that must be carried with a piece of twine. It cuts the fingers; it must frequently be set down. There's real humanity in this novel, and there are insights about love and longing. Quatro is a gifted writer. But ""Fire Sermon"" ultimately reminds the reader of Emma Bovary's observation that there is ""in adultery all the banality of marriage."""

Each award was endowed or underwritten by visual artists like Ellsworth Kelly and his partner, Jack Shear, as well as the foundations of Cy Twombly and Roy Lichtenstein. The painter Cecily Brown, one of the directors of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, said in a statement that she was pleased ""to make these awards in poetry, which is a perennially under-resourced field."" The grant from Kelly and Shear — the C.D. Wright Award for Poetry, named for the former grant recipient who died in 2016 — was given to the Canadian poet Lisa Robertson, who has lived in France since 2004. Writing about her book ""Lisa Robertson's Magenta Soul Whip"" in The New York Times Book Review, Stephen Burt called her ""hard to explain but easy to enjoy."" Anne Boyer, the Missouri-based poet who has written frankly about gender, class and illness, has received the Cy Twombly Award for Poetry. Her recent books include ""Garments Against Women"" (2015), which the critic Maureen N. McLane described in The New York Times Book Review as ""a sad, beautiful, passionate book that registers the political economy of literature and of life itself."" The inaugural Roy Lichtenstein Award, which in the future can go to an artist in any discipline, has been given to the New York-based poet and critic Fred Moten. He has long been interested in black culture and the relationship between experimental art and insurgent social movements. The winners were selected by the Foundation for Contemporary Arts board of directors, which in addition to Ms. Brown includes Mr. Johns and philanthropists like Agnes Gund, president emerita of the Museum of Modern Art."
News,2018-01-01,"TEHRAN — Ignoring pleas for calm from President Hassan Rouhani, Iranian protesters took to the streets in several cities for the fifth day on Monday as pent-up economic and political frustrations boiled over in the broadest display of discontent in years.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/world/middleeast/iran-protests.html,1536," TEHRAN — Ignoring pleas for calm from President Hassan Rouhani, Iranian protesters took to the streets in several cities for the fifth day on Monday as pent-up economic and political frustrations boiled over in the broadest display of discontent in years. The Iranian government responded with conciliatory words from Mr. Rouhani, but also a widening security clampdown — and a pledge late Monday to crack down even harder. The government will not allow an ""insecure situation to continue in Tehran,"" Brig. Gen Esmaeil Kowsari, deputy chief of the main Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps base in Tehran, told the semiofficial ISNA news agency. ""If this situation continues, the officials will definitely make some decisions and at that point this business will be finished."" Despite Mr. Rouhani's diplomatic language, it was clear the demonstrators would be given no leeway. The deputy interior minister, Hossein Zolfaghari, told the semiofficial Jamaran website, ""From tonight the unrest will be controlled more seriously."" On Monday, a crackdown by the government and security services was building, and riot police officers with water cannons were out in full force in Tehran, the capital. The death toll from the clashes was up to at least 21, and in the central province of Esfahan, one police officer was reported killed and three wounded in a gunfight. ""An agitator exploited the current situation, and using a hunting rifle, opened fire on police forces,"" state television reported. Six protesters were killed and three policemen injured Monday night as protesters sought to seize the police station in Qahdarijan in Esfahan Province, state news radio reported on Tuesday. Elsewhere in Esfahan, state radio also reported the killing of an 11-year-old child and a 20-year-old by ""rioters"" in Khomeinishahr Shahr and the death of a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in an attack on a police station in Kahrizsang. In all, about 450 people have been arrested in Tehran alone since the protests began on Saturday, the semiofficial news agency ILNA reported, citing Ali Asghar Naserbakht, the political security deputy for the Tehran governor's office. There were also arrests in provincial towns. Mr. Rouhani has urged demonstrators to avoid violence but defended their right to protest. He did so again on Monday on Twitter. ""People want to talk about economic problems, corruption and lack of transparency in the function of some of the organs and want the atmosphere to be more open,"" he wrote. ""The requests and demands of the people should be taken note of."" President Trump weighed in on Twitter on Monday, saying that the Iranian people ""have been repressed for many years."" ""They are hungry for food & for freedom,"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!"" The protests are not just the largest in Iran since 2009. They also suggest a rejiggering of some traditional divisions. People who live in rural provinces, long viewed as supporters of the authorities, are now leading most of the demonstrations. And while people in Tehran have also taken to the street, the capital is not the center of the protests, as it was during the so-called Green Movement in 2009. In Tehran, many middle-class Iranians share the discontent but also fear insecurity. The frustrations that led to the protests also appear different from the sentiments in 2009. That year, a wave of demonstrations broke out after the contested election of a hard-line president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and then turned into a wider protest movement against Iran's leaders. This time, it is the failure of President Rouhani, a moderate, to deliver greater political changes and economic opportunity, despite the lifting of some of the sanctions against Iran as part of the nuclear deal. Young people are especially angry. The average age of those arrested is under 25, one official said. The poor economy especially affects Iran's young people — more than 50 percent of the population is under 30, according to official statistics. Officially, youth unemployment is near 20 percent, but experts say it is really closer to 40 percent. When the protests started last Thursday in the city of Mashhad, demonstrators chanted slogans about the weak economy. But as the protests spread, they have taken on a far more political cast. Increasingly, they are being directed at Iran's entire political establishment. Some demonstrators have even called for the death of Mr. Rouhani and of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The strength and volatility of the protests have caught Iranian politicians by surprise. Some have denounced them as ""riots,"" while others have acknowledged that the widespread frustrations at their root can no longer be ignored. On Monday in Tehran, the atmosphere was tense and security forces were out in large numbers. Protests occurred sporadically, with people shouting slogans and leaving. The day before, protesters in provincial towns tried to storm police stations, military and installations, and also attacked a seminary, state television reported, showing footage of burned cars and fires. Protests have taken place in at least half a dozen cities, including Karaj, Qazvin, Qaemshahr, Dorud and Tuyserkan, it said. Access to the Telegram messaging app and the Instagram photo and video sharing app continued to be blocked by the authorities, cutting off the main communication tool for protesters. Special software used to circumvent the government filters could still be downloaded easily. And on Monday, as on other days, there were calls for protests online and on foreign-based Persian-language satellite channels. Some residents said they were determined to continue the demonstrations, and several hundred gathered at central squares. While the number of protesters in Tehran was small on Monday, the discontent was widespread. Many people on the streets complained about high prices, corruption and lack of change. ""We need to improve our economy, and the people's voices must be heard,"" said a 28-year-old woman, a piano teacher in Tehran, who asked not to be named out of fear of repercussions. ""I'll go out tonight again."" Many youths in larger cities enthusiastically voted for Mr. Rouhani when he was re-elected in May, raising expectations among many in the reform camp. But since then even many of the president's supporters say he has failed to fulfill his promises for improving an economy sorely hobbled by years of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. Even the lifting of economic sanctions under Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with large foreign powers including the United States has not unleashed the growth Mr. Rouhani had hoped for, as key sectors of the economy remain under the thumb of obscure powers, including religious foundations and the country's Revolutionary Guards. There is mismanagement and widespread corruption in all levels of the state apparatus. Beyond that, the United States has continued other sanctions, making it still harder for Mr. Rouhani to make gains. The economic frustrations do not appear to have been offset by the greater social freedoms that the president has granted young people. Under Mr. Rouhani, strict Islamic rules have been somewhat relaxed. Concerts have been allowed, and the morals police are largely off the streets. Illegal parties are usually no longer raided, although there have been exceptions. But there is a wide gap between Iran's changing and modernizing society and Iranian leaders who insist on keeping up their anti-Western policies and the state interpretation of Islam. Mr. Rouhani's decision not to include any women in his cabinet and his failure to put the relaxation of the rules into law have made many bitter. The president has complained that power centers dominated by hard-liners have blocked many of his plans and decisions. Now some protesters are venting their frustrations at the political and clerical establishment. In Takestan, west of Tehran, several people were arrested after attacking a seminary, the Iranian news media reported. In Karaj, also close to Tehran, a gas station was burned, a witness reported. Earlier on Monday, ILNA quoted Hedayatollah Khademi, a representative for the town of Izeh, in Iran's oil-rich but poor Khuzestan region, as saying two people had died there on Sunday night. He said the cause of death was not immediately known. State television announced that 10 people had died on Sunday, but did not provide a location. ""Some armed protesters tried to take over some police stations and military bases but faced serious resistance from security forces,"" a presenter said. ""Illegal protests continued last night in several cities with less protesters participating, but they were as violent and turbulent, making residents of these cities concerned about their and their businesses' security,"" the state television report said. The videos showed burned cars, fires and wreckage on the pavement. The report also showed a fire-brigade vehicle that was said to have been seized by protesters in Dorud, Lorestan Province. By Monday evening, riot police officers belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps waited in an alley near Tehran's city theater for a potential protest to start, as men and women anxiously walked the sidewalks. Others, families and couples, cruised around the area in cars. Many were young people. ""They want to start, but there is too many police,"" one taxi driver said, looking at hundreds of people, and even more security forces. Plainclothes officers on motorcycles zipped by. Buses stood ready to take potential troublemakers into custody."

But lately, some carriers have been going one step further in redesigning their seats: They’re taking away the seatback screens.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/business/airlines-travel-entertainment.html,1042," Airlines have been shrinking their seats for a long time, aiming to reduce the planes' weight and squeeze in more passengers. But lately, some carriers have been going one step further in redesigning their seats: They're taking away the seatback screens. Formally called in-flight entertainment, the screens, and the preselected media on them, go a long way toward keeping passengers happy and distracted. The longer the flight, the more useful the seatback entertainment becomes. But those entertainment systems are expensive to install. They can cost $10,000 per seat, estimated Dan McKone, managing director and head of the travel and transportation practice at the consulting firm L.E.K. They also add bulk and weight to seats and quickly become technologically obsolete, especially because most Americans are now flying with at least one mobile device, said Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst and co-founder of Atmosphere Research Group. ""Some airlines are looking at this from the standpoint of cost savings by removing the hardware,"" he said. ""They reduce the weight of the aircraft, and they reduce the expense associated with maintaining that equipment."" American and United Airlines are phasing out screens on new short-haul aircraft in favor of content offerings that passengers can stream from their personal devices. The decision on whether to update the screens, Mr. McKone said, is mainly economic. ""I think you're going to continue to see increasing economic pressure not to replace I.F.E., particularly on the shorter-haul fleets,"" he said. Mr. McKone predicted that more domestic flights in the future would offer content streaming on a bring-your-own-device model. Some travelers are happy to say ""good riddance"" to the seatback screens. Lindsay Renfro, an associate professor at the Mayo Clinic, is among them. She travels about once a month for her job developing clinical trials for cancer research and views seatback entertainment as something of a redundant amenity. ""There are screens everywhere else in life,"" she said. ""I know that when I am flying and I look around me, people are by and large using personal devices, even when a seatback screen is available to them."" That is one of the reasons Hawaiian Airlines is going without seatback screens in its new A321 neo planes, its chief commercial officer, Peter Ingram, said. ""With the 321, we recognized a couple of things that are changing in the environment around us that really informed our decision,"" he said. ""The majority of people are showing up with a device of their own, and they're ignoring the devices we offer in-seat."" He added that the rapid pace of technological change meant an installed entertainment was soon obsolete. ""We're focused on the fact that most people are bringing devices on,"" Mr. Ingram said. But industry experts say airlines risk alienating those travelers who do not want to rely on their own device to be entertained while they fly. Patrick Ligonde, a self-proclaimed ""airplane nerd,"" travels with his smartphone for his job in airline ground operations. But when he has to fly from his home base in Philadelphia, he said, he makes sure the seats he purchases have seatback screens, even going so far as to research the aircraft configuration before making a seat selection. ""I try to use the seatback entertainment as much as possible,"" he said. ""From a passenger perspective, it makes it easier to have the monitor right there rather than having to use my own device."" One other advantage, he said, is that he does not arrive at his destination with a dead battery. Mr. Harteveldt said his company's research indicated that many road warriors had the same preference. ""Business travelers have said there's no room to have a smartphone on their tray if they're working on a laptop, or if they're using a tablet or smartphone for work, it's difficult to use that for watching entertainment. Having the separate screen is a plus for them,"" he said. Some airlines are betting that they can peel away market share from their competitors by catering to travelers like Mr. Ligonde, making in-flight entertainment a brand differentiator. In 2017, Delta rolled out free in-flight mobile messaging, and the airline is in the process of installing new screens and making more content available in-flight. ""As we look at the way they live their life on the ground with more and more media at their fingertips, we're looking to replicate that up in the sky,"" said Andrew Wingrove, Delta's managing director for product strategy and customer experience. ""We believe strongly in having that extra screen for customers in the seatback."" Alaska Airlines also started offering free in-flight messaging last year, along with faster Wi-Fi. JetBlue Airways, which has made in-flight entertainment a crucial part of its brand image since its debut, is investing in new entertainment systems for its A320 and A321 planes, said Mariya Stoyanova, the airline's director of product development. ""When we took off flying in 2000, we had live TV in every seat. That was something unheard-of at the time,"" she said. ""That's part of our brand commitment."" Some airlines are also investing in content, even commissioning branded video material to accompany the assortment of movies, television shows games and other media that passengers can consume during flights. ""We have content on our Fly-Fi hub that's kind of like an in-flight magazine,"" Ms. Stoyanova said. She said JetBlue was working with the media company PureWow to create branded content, including short videos with travel-related tips and advice from flight crew members. ""We're trying to make it relevant to the customers,"" Ms. Stoyanova said. Michael Keating, co-chief executive of Ink, which produces in-flight magazines, also develops custom video content for 40 percent of its more than 25 airline clients worldwide. By the end of 2018, he predicted, that number will be up to 60 percent. ""The key thing for the airlines,"" he said, ""is to engage with their passengers."" The airlines rely on their in-flight media offerings not only to foster brand loyalty, but also to serve a more practical need: distracting tightly packed economy-class passengers. ""A lot of it is exactly for that purpose — it keeps the customers occupied and in their seats,"" said Robert W. Mann, an airline industry consultant. ""It's incredibly useful, and the longer the flight gets, the more useful it is."""
News,2018-01-01,"TETERBORO, N.J. — There was a time when Teterboro Airport was the crown jewel of the New York region.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/nyregion/teterboro-airport-steeped-in-glamour-history-and-noise.html,1237," TETERBORO, N.J. — There was a time when Teterboro Airport was the crown jewel of the New York region. Charles Lindbergh often flew into the New Jersey airport, 12 miles northwest of Midtown Manhattan, to meet with the president of Wright Aeronautical, which built the engine that powered his historic trans-Atlantic flight. Amelia Earhart flew here to prepare for her own trans-Atlantic trip. The F-32, the world's biggest passenger plane when it was built in 1930, roared to life at Teterboro, as did the Barling Bomber, then the largest American-made bomber. ""At that time, there was nothing but pride for having a facility like that,"" said Shea Oakley, executive director of the Aviation Hall of Fame of New Jersey, which is on the airport's grounds. Today, Teterboro, the first airport in the metropolitan area when it opened in 1919, is more likely to conjure grimaces than pride. ""Growing like a monster,"" some neighbors say of the airport, which sits on 827 acres and handles general aviation, industry-speak for noncommercial flights. ""Horrific"" is a word used by others. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Teterboro, received more than 2,300 noise complaints about the airport in 2016 — an average of about one every four hours. In a November report, the Regional Plan Association, an influential urban policy group, recommended phasing out the airport, which it said would be flooded by rising sea levels by the end of the century. It suggested diverting Teterboro's flights to the region's three major airports — Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty — instead. The idea has fans. ""Speaking from the residents of Hackensack, I believe that they would be thrilled to not have to be part of the impact of the airport,"" said Kathy Canestrino, the deputy mayor of Hackensack, which is three miles from Teterboro. But for Teterboro's loyalists, including many employees who have worked there for decades, shutting it down is unfathomable. The airport is an economic engine for the area, supporting more than 170,000 takeoffs and landings and 14,900 jobs each year, according to the Port Authority. It drives more than $2 billion in annual sales activity. And despite the Regional Plan Association's recommendation, the Port Authority is expanding the airport. Plans are underway to develop 15 acres, including the construction of three hangars. ""There have been various efforts over the years to close Teterboro, but it's not possible,"" Mr. Oakley said, citing the volume of flights the airport accommodates. ""It's an absolutely essential facility,"" he added. In a statement, the Port Authority called the Regional Plan Association's forecast ""overly pessimistic"" and said the agency had already improved the airport's drainage and sewage systems. The gulf between those who would see Teterboro closed and those who cannot imagine such a thing is fitting for an airport seemingly made of contradictions. It is a centerpiece of aviation history that is virtually unknown outside select circles, a gateway for the rich and famous that is surrounded by wetlands. ""People think it's just tumbleweeds: 'Oh, it's just a noisy thing, we don't need this,'"" said Ed Furst, president of the Teterboro chapter of the Professional Aviation Maintenance Association. ""But there's a whole lot of business that's behind this airport. There is a lot of history behind it."" The airport is dominated by four companies that handle private planes, providing services from fuel to repair to storage, said Kirk Stephen, director of marketing for Meridian, which owns a terminal and three hangars at Teterboro. On a recent afternoon, men in crisp suits and families dragging suitcases filed through Meridian's lobby, which, with its illuminated Christmas tree, placards advertising free internet, and somewhat sterile air, was reminiscent of a first-class lounge at Kennedy or Newark. ""We cater to a very discerning clientele,"" Mr. Stephen said. The airport fiercely guards the privacy of its customers. Discretion is one of the reasons many choose Teterboro, Mr. Stephen said. Celebrities and business executives can slip undisturbed from the plane to the private terminal to a black car bound for the city. Mr. Furst said airport workers were trained to give passengers a wide berth. Most are so accustomed to seeing famous faces that they hardly blink. (Mr. Furst conceded that he had once said hello to Bill Gates.) Many of the restaurants that provide passenger meals are not even told who they are for, said Susanna Bazzarelli, co-manager of the nearby Italian restaurant Bazzarelli. Still, clues slip through. An order once arrived for a ""high-profile"" customer who asked for several servings of kid-friendly foods such as pizza and pasta. Ms. Bazzarelli recalled thinking: ""Oh, my God, like, it's got to be Angelina Jolie."" (She later found out she was right.) Teterboro is also an important gateway for organ transplants and other medical services, said Michael Klein, chief executive of OpenAir, a charter company that operates out of Teterboro. Airlifting a kidney or a heart needs to be done on short notice — a difficult task at commercial hubs, where takeoffs and landings must be scheduled days in advance, Mr. Klein said. ""We'll get a call in the middle of the night,"" he said. ""Typically within an hour we'll be in the air. Someone needs a liver, someone else dies and wants to donate a liver — that all comes together very quickly."" But neighbors worry that the low-flying, ever-larger corporate jets that frequent the airport are not only noisy but dangerous. In May, a jet bound for Teterboro crashed in the nearby town of Carlstadt, killing two on board. In 2009, a pilot died after his plane crashed as it approached Teterboro; the accident came just two weeks after a plane that had departed from the airport collided with a sightseeing helicopter over the Hudson River, killing all nine people aboard both aircraft. The current flight path into Teterboro brings planes directly over Hackensack's high-rise condominiums, said Connie Bovino, chairwoman of the town's Condo and Co-op Advisory Board. Ms. Bovino said that when she lived on the 20th floor of a high-rise, she would often make eye contact with pilots passing by. Murray Runin, the previous chairman of the board, acknowledged that the airport might provide some economic benefit. ""But is it benefiting the local economy in a safe manner?"" he said. ""At a certain point, when do you say it's too much?"" The Federal Aviation Administration recently agreed to evaluate an alternate flight path beginning in 2019 that goes over a highway instead of the high-rises. Ms. Canestrino, Hackensack's deputy mayor, said she was optimistic that the new flight path would reduce tensions. It would not, however, address a root of the dissatisfaction with Teterboro: a feeling that towns like Hackensack absorb all the drawbacks of the airport without reaping any of the benefits, Ms. Canestrino said. ""Very separate and distant,"" she said of the relationship between the airport and its neighbors. Even some of Teterboro's devotees, like Mr. Klein, acknowledged the difficulty of communicating the joys of the airport to those who had not flown into it. ""To get there, it's something hard to do,"" Mr. Klein said. But, he said, it is worth the difficulty. ""It's busy, it's exciting,"" Mr. Klein said. ""Your adrenaline goes when you walk around that place. You see just everything that you can imagine, from a guy in a business suit to a military helicopter to a jet going internationally. ""You have to experience it,"" he added."
News,2018-01-02,Please take your seats.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/business/dealbook/biggest-deals-2017.html,1421," Please take your seats. It is that time of year again: our annual closing dinner, where we look back at the year that was, to toast and roast the year's deal makers on Wall Street and in Washington and look ahead to what may come next. And what a year it was. This year, we decided to hold our dinner at the Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla., just down the road from the Mar-a-Lago resort, better known as the Winter White House. Given that President Trump has spent nearly a third of his presidency — that's not a typo — at one of his properties, as The Wall Street Journal reported, we figured we would try to make it convenient for him. There were a surprising number of free openings at Mar-a-Lago given all the cancellations by foundations and charities, but ever since an artist projected ""Pay Trump Bribes Here"" on the Trump International Hotel in Washington, our conflicts committee suggested that hosting the dinner at Mar-a-Lago would be a bad idea. We also figured holding the dinner in Florida would be convenient for so many of you moguls and machers already down here looking for real estate since the tax bill was signed into law. The other bonus of buying here, of course, is that your home is protected even if you file for bankruptcy. Sitting at the dais are Mr. Trump along with the first lady. (Ivanka, Jared and the rest of the family were away on vacation.) Next to him are Rupert Murdoch and his new B.F.F., Robert Iger of the Walt Disney Company, who just gave up any hope of running for president in 2020, a condition of his deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox's assets. To their right are the chief negotiators for the tax plan: Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin (and Ms. Mnuchin's wife, Louise Linton, who I should mention — and I'll be sure to hashtag this on Instagram — is wearing a beautiful scarf from Hermes and gown by Valentino). The seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump's Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon's second headquarters. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's founder, is also here this year. He is seated at the Uber table, having just struck a deal to invest $9 billion in the company at a 30 percent discount to the company's previous valuation of $68 billion, although he had also invested $1 billion at the company's previous valuation to maintain the fiction that the company was still worth $68 billion. It's been a tough year at the Uber table of frenemies: Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's new chief executive; Travis Kalanick, Uber's founder; Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member; and Bill Gurley, one of Uber's largest investors. To help keep the peace, we've invited a calming influence to sit with them: Anthony Scaramucci, the Mooch, who had his own tough year as the president's director of communications for a hot minute. We had extended an invitation to Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, but our invitation was returned. When we tried to call him at the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh, otherwise known as the Royal Prison, we were told, ""The hotel telephone lines are currently disconnected until further notice."" (By the way, that's not a joke.) And then there is the Facebook table: Mark Zuckerberg is here this year along with Sheryl Sandberg. We're sorry to say that Vladimir Putin could not make it. I jest! Sort of. Finally, we have the Bitcoin table: The Winklevoss twins, newly minted as Bitcoin billionaires (cut out the gloating and spitballs to the Facebook table, please) and Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, who has said Bitcoin mania is ""worse than tulip bulbs,"" adding: ""It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed."" We'd love to hear the dinner conversation among you all. Now, on to the toasts of 2017. DEAL OF THE YEAR Amazon.com's acquisition of Whole Foods came as a true surprise. The deal has the potential to truly accelerate Amazon's march into our daily lives by giving it an even closer distribution point to our homes. It also was a signal to the rest of the marketplace that nothing is off limits. The betting line is that the next land grab for Amazon is pharmaceuticals, which may have driven CVS's $68 billion bid for Aetna. Also, a postscript: One deal that has not received enough credit but that proved itself in 2017 was Walmart's acquisition of Jet.com. The $3.3 billion acquisition of a money-losing site seemed like a mistake, but has breathed new life into Walmart's e-commerce business. SURPRISE I.P.O. SUCCESS Roku, the streaming television company, went public, and its stock is up 280 percent, one of the highest increases of the year. The company is being compared to Netflix and is considered a pure-play bet on over-the-top streaming television services.  A SIGN OF THE TOP? Blue Apron, a meal kit service, went public and quickly fell faster than Pets.com. Who thought that was a good idea? TRUMP WINNERS Stock investors were some of the biggest beneficiaries in 2017, with a rally that began when Mr. Trump won the presidency. On an individual basis, Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group gambled early and publicly on Mr. Trump, despite protests inside and outside his firm. It gave him a ringside seat to the White House last year. Saudi Arabia backed a new $40 billion infrastructure fund by the firm. And Mr. Schwarzman, like the entire private equity industry, was a beneficiary of the new tax plan, which kept carried interest taxed at capital gains rates with only a slight adjustment. MORAL C.E.O. WINNER Kenneth C. Frazier of Merck was the first chief executive on one of Mr. Trump's councils to rebuke the president's comments after violence in Charlottesville, Va. A wave of executives followed suit, but only after Mr. Frazier made the first move. That took real courage. TWITTER C.E.O. WINNER Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs won Twitter in 2017 with this witty tweet during the solar eclipse: ""Wish the moon wasn't the only thing casting a shadow across the country. We got through one, we'll get through the other."" ENTREPRENEUR OF THE YEAR Say what you will about Elon Musk — he has fans and critics — but he again proved that he thinks differently. Sure, he introduced new Teslas and sent more rockets into space. But he also introduced perhaps his craziest idea: the Boring Company. Technically, he founded the company in December 2016, but it was during 2017 that we really learned about his ambitions: He wants to dig huge tunnels under the earth to create a patchwork of roadways. The economics and physics of it all have been questioned. But as a venture capitalist, Jason Calacanis, said this summer: ""Betting against Elon Musk is betting against the future of humanity, and it's an incredibly stupid thing to do."" THANK YOU OF THE YEAR Janet Yellen, the departing Federal Reserve chairwoman, deserves our genuine thanks for steering the economy successfully and overseeing a drop in the unemployment rate to levels not seen in decades. She took verbal abuse from our president, who called her ""obviously political"" before he was elected, only for him to double back and praise her once he realized that his economy was her economy, too. MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE IN BUSINESS The exposure of bad behavior by men toward women in the workplace — and elsewhere — throughout virtually all industries was perhaps the most important and profound story of the year. It has already shaken up a multitude of businesses, and more revelations are likely to come. Its impact on our culture and office politics will last far longer, hopefully, than anything else discussed at tonight's dinner.  QUESTION OF THE YEAR Why does the administration really want to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal? Of course, the speculation in media circles is it has to do with Mr. Trump's war on CNN. That may or may not be true. But the president didn't help himself when Sarah Huckabee Sanders quoted him as saying he supported a rival merger between Mr. Murdoch and Disney, saying that ""this could be a great thing for jobs"" when it plainly will result in layoffs."

Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: • Iran is struggling to contain the most significant protests in years, as citizens vent pent-up frustrations over President Hassan Rouhani's failure to deliver greater political changes and economic opportunities. Security forces were out in large numbers in Tehran on Monday, a day after armed protesters were repelled from storming military bases and police stations. At least 13 people have been killed since last week, according to the state news media. Hundreds have been arrested. _____ • Our reporters retraced the origin of U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian contacts with the Trump administration to an upscale London bar. Over drinks there in 2016, George Papadopoulos, above, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign told an Australian diplomat that Russia had political dirt on Hillary Clinton. When leaked emails began appearing, Australian officials are said to have passed that information on. Our chief White House correspondent ponders to what extent President Trump has changed the American presidency, making it ""more authentic or more autocratic, depending on the vantage point. Either way, it may never be the same."" _____ • It's called Time's Up. Hundreds of actresses, entertainment executives and insiders announced a sprawling initiative to fight sexual harassment in Hollywood and in other workplaces. The group also seeks to defuse criticism that the spotlight on the #MeToo movement has been dominated by the accusers of high-profile men, while the travails of working-class women have been overlooked. _____ • As midnight struck from East to West, revelers welcomed 2018 with fireworks, festivities, dancing and countless weddings. Our photo editors captured some of the celebrations. North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, used his speech to reach out to South Korea, agreeing to send a delegation for the Winter Olympics while claiming the ability to make a nuclear strike on the U.S. (Analysts said he was trying to sow discord between Washington and Seoul.) Our Berlin correspondent dissected Chancellor Angela Merkel's New Year's speech. President Emmanuel Macron of France addressed immigration and populism in his address, as Ms. Merkel did. • A Danish biotechnology company  is trying to fight climate change, one laundry load at a time, by improving detergents. • China is building a city from scratch in the middle of a Kazakh desert as part of its ambitious plan to restore old overland trade routes to Europe. • Rupert Murdoch's decision to sell most of 21st Century Fox has many wondering what the future holds for him and the two sons who seemed on the cusp of taking over his vast empire. • Intelligence agencies have known for some time that security products like Kaspersky Lab's antivirus software can be a powerful spy tool. • Marijuana shops have opened in California, inaugurating what some say will become the world's largest market for legalized recreational cannabis. • Here's a snapshot of global markets. • Romania is bracing for a tumultuous month. Legislation that critics say would weaken the judiciary's independence is awaiting the signature of President Klaus Iohannis, who has opposed such changes. [The New York Times] • Israel's right wing is signaling its intention to doom hopes for a two-state solution to the conflict with the Palestinians. [The New York Times] • Poland hosts North Korean laborers, showing how difficult it is to sever the nuclear pariah state from the global economy. [The New York Times] • A powerful winter storm  caused widespread power outages in Brittany, France. It is expected to move across the country and toward Germany overnight. [Associated Press] • Italy, Hungary and the Czech Republic are among the European countries voting in potentially pivotal elections this year. Here's a look at the votes ahead and recent polling. [Politico] • In Germany, a new law on hate speech on the internet has entered into force. It has raised questions about freedom of expression. [Deutsche Welle] • A former cage fighter in London has earned global attention for his method of rehabilitating Islamist militants. [The New York Times] • A widening debate about slaughtering rules pits religious freedom against animal rights in the Netherlands. [The New York Times] • A Belgian entrepreneur has handed out origami-style cardboard tents to homeless people in Brussels, where fabric tents are banned. [The New York Times] Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • Start the new year by relaxing and centering yourself. • Tips for dealing with a cold or the flu. (Honey and ginger ale, among other things.) • Recipe of the day: Cook black-eyed peas with collard greens for New Year's good fortune. • The New York Times has a new publisher in A. G. Sulzberger. Ask him questions here. (And here is his introductory letter to readers.) • In soccer news, the superiority of the Premier League's top six teams has undermined its reputation as one of the most competitive leagues in the world. • The BBC, once a bastion of British English, now sees an opportunity in West African pidgin, spoken by more than 75 million people. • Charming villages. Inventive meals. A gorgeous glacier to hike. What's not to like in Norway? • This year will be an exciting year for astronomy geeks. Among the highlights: a new rocket from Elon Musk and SpaceX, and possible moon landings by India, China and private companies. We begin today on a high kick. The Rockettes closed their annual holiday season run on Monday, their 85th year at Radio City Music Hall in New York. But their famous kicklines are only a part of the storied history of one of New York's cultural cornerstones. Opened on Dec. 27, 1932, Radio City was ""the largest temple of entertainment of its kind in the world,"" The Times (somewhat breathlessly) proclaimed. It was part of John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s plan to revive New York after the Great Depression by building a ""city within a city"" that would provide jobs for New Yorkers and convert a neighborhood known as ""the speakeasy belt"" into a commercial hub. Rockefeller partnered with the Radio Corporation of America to develop the 6,200-seat theater, and the building's design became a beacon of the art deco form. The theater has hosted everything from the MTV Video Music Awards to more than 700 movie premieres, including ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" starring Gregory Peck, a former Radio City usher.

News,2018-01-02,"For our first Student Opinion question of 2018, we wonder: What do you think will happen this year? What predictions can you make for global, national or local events? For your own personal life? Why?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/learning/what-are-your-predictions-for-2018.html,516," For our first Student Opinion question of 2018, we wonder: What do you think will happen this year? What predictions can you make for global, national or local events? For your own personal life? Why? In the Opinion essay ""When Forecasters Get It Wrong: Always,"" Ruchir Sharma writes about predictions made one year ago—and just how wrong experts were: To borrow from Yogi Berra, it is tough to make predictions, especially about the future. But 2017 was particularly difficult. On many of the biggest forecasts — global growth, inflation, the trajectory of the big powers — the experts got the year wrong. They thought the global economy would continue to struggle, inflation would stage a comeback, right-wing nationalism would prevent economic revival in Europe and laggards like Japan, Russia and Brazil would remain weak. They expected the United States to be the one relatively bright spot and that Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts and protectionism would drive the mighty dollar higher. Instead, President Trump had little impact on the economy, and the dollar fell against every major currency. While American stocks did well, foreign markets did better, because the rest of the world grew faster than expected, and inflation remained quiet. Given up for dead, even Japan bounced back. The nationalist right underachieved, and recovery spread to Europe and beyond. Three-quarters of the globe saw an acceleration in economic growth for the first time in a decade. But you might also want to read articles that make predictions about the year ahead in politics (will the U.S. Senate achieve more bipartisan agreement this year?); sports (can any team unseat the New England Patriots as Super Bowl champions?); culture (will the ""most vexing"" questions of 2017 be answered?); or fashion (will Ultra Violet be a ubiquitous color? will women stop wearing high heels?). Students: Read some of these articles, then tell us: — What predictions do you have about our world in 2018 in general? — What do you think will happen in global or U.S. politics? What economic predictions can you make? — What do you think could happen in the realms of culture, the arts, fashion and style? Be as specific as you can, especially about the aspects of culture that interest you most. — What about new trends in how people communicate, travel and even shop? — When it comes to your life and your loved ones' lives, what do you hope or believe will happen? — Do you agree with Mr. Sharma that predictions are difficult to make accurately? Why do humans love making predictions? How can that sometimes go awry? — Which of your predictions worry you most? Which are most comforting? Why? — Do you have any milestones coming up this year, such as a significant birthday or a rite of passage such as a graduation? In general, what do you most look forward to in 2018? Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public."
News,2018-01-02,"The United States spends almost twice as much on health care, as a percentage of its economy, as other advanced industrialized countries — totaling $3.3 trillion, or 17.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2016. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/upshot/us-health-care-expensive-country-comparison.html,952," The United States spends almost twice as much on health care, as a percentage of its economy, as other advanced industrialized countries — totaling $3.3 trillion, or 17.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2016.  But a few decades ago American health care spending was much closer to that of peer nations.  What happened? A large part of the answer can be found in the title of a 2003 paper in Health Affairs by the Princeton University health economist Uwe Reinhardt: ""It's the prices, stupid."" The study, also written by Gerard Anderson, Peter Hussey and Varduhi Petrosyan, found that people in the United States typically use about the same amount of health care as people in other wealthy countries do, but pay a lot more for it. Ashish Jha, a physician with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, studies how health systems from various countries compare in terms of prices and health care use. ""What was true in 2003 remains so today,"" he said. ""The U.S. just isn't that different from other developed countries in how much health care we use. It is very different in how much we pay for it."" Assessing the systems in eight countries can inform the debate in the U.S. over universal coverage. A recent study in JAMA by scholars from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle and the U.C.L.A. David Geffen School of Medicine also points to prices as a likely culprit. Their study spanned 1996 to 2013 and analyzed U.S. personal health spending by the size of the population; its age; and the amount of disease present in it.  They also examined how much health care we use in terms of such things as doctor visits, days in the hospital and prescriptions. They looked at what happens during those visits and hospital stays (called care intensity), combined with the price of that care.  The researchers looked at the breakdown for 155 different health conditions separately. Since their data included only personal health care spending, it did not account for spending in the health sector not directly attributed to care of patients, like hospital construction and administrative costs connected to running Medicaid and Medicare. Over all, the researchers found that American personal health spending grew by about $930 billion between 1996 and 2013, from $1.2 trillion to $2.1 trillion (amounts adjusted for inflation). This was a huge increase, far outpacing overall economic growth. The health sector grew at a 4 percent annual rate, while the overall economy grew at a 2.4 percent rate.  You'd expect some growth in health care spending over this span from the increase in population size and the aging of the population. But that explains less than half of the spending growth. After accounting for those kinds of demographic factors, which we can do very little about, health spending still grew by about $574 billion from 1996 to 2013. Did the increasing sickness in the American population explain much of the rest of the growth in spending? Nope. Measured by how much we spend, we've actually gotten a bit healthier. Change in health status was associated with a decrease in health spending — 2.4 percent — not an increase. A great deal of this decrease can be attributed to factors related to cardiovascular diseases, which were associated with about a 20 percent reduction in spending.  This could be a result of greater use of statins for cholesterol or reduced smoking rates, though the study didn't point to specific causes. On the other hand, increases in diabetes and low back and neck pain were associated with spending growth, but not enough to offset the decrease from cardiovascular and other diseases. Did we spend more time in the hospital? No, though we did have more doctor visits and used more prescription drugs. These tend to be less costly than hospital stays, so, on balance, changes in health care use were associated with a minor reduction (2.5 percent) in health care spending.  That leaves what happens during health care visits and hospital stays (care intensity) and the price of those services and procedures.  Did we do more for patients in each health visit or inpatient stay? Did we charge more? The JAMA study found that, together, these accounted for 63 percent of the increase in spending from 1996 to 2013. In other words, most of the explanation for American health spending growth — and why it has pulled away from health spending in other countries — is that more is done for patients during hospital stays and doctor visits, they're charged more per service, or both. Though the JAMA study could not separate care intensity and price, other research blames prices more. For example, one study found that the spending growth for treating patients between 2003 and 2007 is almost entirely because of a growth in prices, with little contribution from growth in the quantity of treatment services provided. Another study found that U.S. hospital prices are 60 percent higher than those in Europe. Other studies also point to prices as a major factor in American health care spending growth. There are ways to combat high health care prices. One is an all-payer system, like that seen in Maryland. This regulates prices so that all insurers and public programs pay the same amount. A single-payer system could also regulate prices. If attempted nationally, or even in a state, either of these would be met with resistance from all those who directly benefit from high prices, including physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies — and pretty much every other provider of health care in the United States. Higher prices aren't all bad for consumers. They probably lead to some increased innovation, which confers benefits to patients globally. Though it's reasonable to push back on high health care prices, there may be a limit to how far we should."
News,2018-01-02,"There’s nothing like a total absence of safety measures to add a little excitement to a historical site. Within an hour of landing on La Isla de la Juventud, the Isle of Youth, I was clambering through an underground tunnel in the Presidio Modelo, or Model Prison, Cuba’s most dreaded pre-revolutionary prison, using my iPhone as a torch and trying not to slip on wooden planks and rubble. After squeezing up a rusty spiral staircase, I emerged atop a tower at the center of an enormous circular cell building that resembled a tropical Colosseum, where a single guard would once monitor more than 1,000 prisoners at a time. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/travel/cuba-isle-of-youth-isla-de-juventud.html,3438," There's nothing like a total absence of safety measures to add a little excitement to a historical site. Within an hour of landing on La Isla de la Juventud, the Isle of Youth, I was clambering through an underground tunnel in the Presidio Modelo, or Model Prison, Cuba's most dreaded pre-revolutionary prison, using my iPhone as a torch and trying not to slip on wooden planks and rubble. After squeezing up a rusty spiral staircase, I emerged atop a tower at the center of an enormous circular cell building that resembled a tropical Colosseum, where a single guard would once monitor more than 1,000 prisoners at a time.  The scale was bewildering — it was one of four 1931 jail structures in the Model Prison, rising like sinister missile silos, with a mess hall at their center. Just as bewildering: the fact that nobody would stop me climbing five stories without handrails into cells with a 50-foot drop onto concrete. (One can only marvel at Cuban liability laws, or the lack thereof.) The whiff of danger helped bring the disturbing past of the Presidio, which functioned from the late 1920s to 1967, to vivid life. A small museum was filled with startling photos of the prison's brutal inner life, when it was run by wild convict gangs with weapons crafted from iron spikes and nails. But the most striking sight of all came when I entered the former hospital ward, which in the 1950s was reserved for political prisoners. Posted on a wall was a mug shot of its most notorious inmate, Fidel Castro — without a beard.  Like the few other visitors to the Presidio that day, I had to stop and stare at the clean-shaven, well-fed features of Prisoner 3859, who, instead of his famous Old Testament whiskers, sported a scraggly pencil mustache. It was a sudden step back into a barely remembered Cuba, when Fidel was not yet ""Fidel."" Today, the image of the hirsute Castro in military khakis is so ingrained in the popular imagination that he seems to have sprung ready-made onto the world stage when the revolution succeeded in 1959. But almost nobody had heard of him six years earlier, in 1953, when, as a 27-year-old lawyer, he began his rebellious career with an attack on a military barracks in the city of Santiago. Castro had hoped this would spark an uprising around Cuba, but it failed dismally. Many of his 160 or so followers were tortured and executed and most of the rest hunted down. He was given a 15-year sentence and sent with 25 compañeros to La Isla. It was in this prison, improbably enough, that the Cuban revolution was effectively planned. The dictator Fulgencio Batista made the mistake of placing all the conspirators together in the hospital wing, and they proceeded to treat it as a revolutionary boot camp, congregating for daily lessons on politics and conducting secret communications with supporters around Cuba. ""What a fantastic school this prison is!"" Castro wrote gleefully in a letter. ""From here I'm able to finish forging my vision of the world …"" After four months, he was removed to solitary, but even there he kept in touch with his men using messages written in lemon juice that were smuggled in cigars or mashed potatoes. He also secretly wrote a tract called ""La Historia Me Absolverá"" (""History Will Absolve Me""), a recreation of his trial defense speech that was spirited page by page to Havana and published as a rousing call to arms. By the time popular opinion led to the men's release in 1955, after serving less than two years of their sentences, the once-disorganized rebel group had become a coherent political cell, with a support network and a clear plan for a guerrilla war. The Presidio was closed a few years after Castro's victory in 1959, and is now maintained as a shrine to the revolution's early struggle, with photos of each prisoner over his bed. It's a tribute to the resilience of the young rebels who — whatever their later faults once they took power — took on the brutal Batista dictatorship at great personal risk. The aura of idealism becomes particularly poignant today, as Cuba's revolutionary dream has become as battered as the corrugated iron ceiling of the Presidio itself — its gaping views of the sky letting in the beating sun, the tropical rain and chirping green parrots. As I discovered over the next three days, almost every corner of Isle of Youth — or simply La Isla, as it is referred to by residents — hides an equally eccentric saga. Located off the south coast of the main island, the largest of the nation's 4,000-odd offshore cays and islands, it has been specializing in oddity ever since Christopher Columbus weighed anchor here to find provisions on his second voyage in 1494 and was mystified by its monstrous crocodiles and raucous bird life. Soon after, pirates hid in its coves, making it an inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island.""  The stories become even more outlandish in the 20th century. Following the Spanish-American War, the Isle of Pines (as it was then known) became an American territory in the early 1900s, and settlers with names like Chuck and Martha dug citrus orchards in townships called McKinley, Columbia and San Francisco Heights. It was on its return to Cuba in 1924 that the island entered its Devil's Island phase, with the Model Prison built as a rare example of the notorious Panopticon — in which myriad inmates could be watched by a single guard — conceived by the 18th-century British philosopher Jeremy Bentham. Then, at the height of the revolution in 1978, Castro returned to the island as Maximum Leader and declared that it would become a unique Communist education center, where high school students from Third World countries could study in a sun-kissed paradise.  Today, La Isla is embarking on yet another reinvention — as an ecotourism destination. A few entrepreneurs are making modest attempts to lure foreign travelers and their hard currency to its pristine beaches and offshore coral reefs, which are among the best preserved in the Caribbean. ""What's important to marine life is scale, and Cuba is so big,"" said David E. Guggenheim, an American marine biologist who founded a nonprofit called Ocean Doctor, who I first met in Havana during a conference on marine protection. ""Size matters! Reefs need large integrated ecosystems to survive.""  Cuba is unique in the Western Hemisphere for its near-total lack of coastal development, he explained. Since the collapse of the U.S.S.R. in 1991, Cuban farmers have had no access to pesticides or fertilizers, so there is none of the chemical flow-off that can devastate marine life. ""Farmers on the Isle of Youth have been forced to practice organic agriculture,"" Mr. Guggenheim said. ""Most of them don't even have tractors. It's amazing that such a thing is possible in the 21st century."" Still, it's an uphill battle to attract travelers, since La Isla is today so obscure that even most Cubans know nothing about it. I had only the haziest idea of what I might find there when I turned up at the Havana airport before dawn to catch a propeller plane. A half-hour later, we were banking over the comma-shaped island and landing at its only town, Nueva Gerona. I was relieved to find that La Isla had lost none of its oddity: We were met at the tiny airport by a nurse in white uniform who screened us all for fevers. While it's no longer true to say that Havana is ""stuck in the 1950s,"" an argument can be made for La Isla — perhaps the 1850s. There are no streetlights in Nueva Gerona, no buildings taller than two stories, and almost the only traffic is horse-and-buggy. On its sleepy pedestrian boulevard, the main cultural attraction is a map of Cuba made from rusty horseshoes. At dusk, teenagers make out in the Park of the Heroic Guerrilla, while older couples promenade arm in arm and take romantic carriage rides holding hands. After dark, everyone converges on the boulevard to hear live salsa and dance, the only concession to the 21st century being a decent sound system. I checked into a casa particular, a private guesthouse, a cozy home decorated with ceramic fish and boasting a sunny billiards room. It was run by a voluble woman named Diami, who whipped up fortifying breakfasts of sweet black coffee, farm eggs and chunks of mango, the most succulent of the tropical fruits that grow like weeds on the fertile island. (""We call these American mangoes because they are plump and red,"" she deadpanned.) The islanders spoke with cheery resignation about being forgotten by the world. ""We suffer from double insularity,"" a wiry, chain-smoking poet named Tony Ramírez said excitedly, when I met him at one of the few restaurants, El Galeón (which, as its name suggests, was shaped like a galleon). ""We feel very far from the rest of Cuba, which is already cut off from the world."" Tony drew inspiration for his writing from being in un mundo aparte, a world apart, he said, but worried about the island's vulnerability: ""Communications are a problem. One puff of wind, let alone a cyclone, and we're on our own."" Clearly, nobody comes to La Isla for the night life: By 9 p.m., Gerona was a ghost town. The next morning, I was ready to sally forth into the countryside, but there were only two jeeps for hire, I learned, and both were broken. Luckily, I found a taxi driver named Ray drowsing by the plaza in his battered blue Lada. Soon we were chugging along empty, palm-fringed roads past limestone protrusions called mogotes — the same sensuous rock formations that has turned the Cuban province of Pinar del Río into a busy tourist destination, but here stand solitary and unseen. Marble is quarried from their flanks in such great quantities that many peasant huts have the polished stone for their floors. On this island of broken dreams, the ruins of the revolutionary schools of the 1980s litter the landscape like giant Lego blocks. Castro traveled here to personally inaugurate the idealistic education program in 1978 and change the name of the Isle of Pines to Isle of Youth — which has a Communist Utopian ring but also evokes the mad quest of Ponce de León for the Fountain of Youth. (Confusingly, islanders are still called Pineros in Cuba.) Within a decade there were 61 schools on the island serving 35,000 students, mostly from Africa. After the Soviet Union crumbled, funding was cut and the students vanished as if they had never been here. A 2008 hurricane did the rest by gutting the schools.  Although most of the Soviet-style structures are in poetic decay, three still function for locals. We called in at Escuela No. 8, the Clara Zetkin School, named after a German Marxist theorist and now filled with island children. The walls are still decorated with a Cold War mural, the Cuban version of ""if you see something, say something"": A giant eye hovers over a map of the island with an illustrated list of dangers that pupils should report, including ""enemy aircraft,"" ""enemy parachutists"" and ""dead animals.""  But the most unexpected historical site is a peaceful field only a few miles from town. El Cementerio Americano, the American Cemetery, is the last ghostly reminder of the quarter century when the United States ran La Isla as a virtual colony. After the Spanish-American War of 1898, Cuba was put under United States military rule until 1902; in the treaties that followed, ownership of the Isle of Youth was left so vague that American companies bought up most of the arable land and opened it to settlers. To the fury of Cuban patriots, farmers from Iowa and California moved here assuming it would become an official part of the United States. (One pamphlet pushing for full annexation was called: ""The Isle of Pines: American or What?"") Tourists traveled from New York to loll by its mineral pools; the poet Hart Crane stayed one summer and was fascinated to experience a hurricane, which inspired the poem ""Eternity.""  When Congress reluctantly gave La Isla back to Cuba in 1924, most settlers left in disappointment, but those who stayed are buried in the American Cemetery. I strolled with the bemused taxista Ray through the lonely field in golden light, reading names from overgrown gravestones — one shaped like a tree trunk — and pausing at a gazebo until the mosquitoes drove us out.  It was time to head to the island's wild south, a jigsaw of protected landscapes informally called the Siguanea Nature Reserve where caves are filled with pre-Colombian carvings, sea turtles lounge by the beaches and reptiles bask in the swamps. My plan was to visit the evocatively named village of Cocodrilo (crocodile) with Dr. Guggenheim, who since 2015 has worked with a local group there called Red Alerta to protect its pristine coral reefs. It is a singular Cuban-American joint venture. His Washington-based N.G.O., Ocean Doctor, provides equipment and trains villagers to work as guides instead of fishing illegally — a standard ecotourism model in other parts of the world, but a radical departure in Cuba, where the economy is still mostly state-run and grass-roots activism is discouraged.  ""As fearful as we are of thousands of Americans going down to Cuba and recreating the mass tourism model that destroyed much of the Caribbean,"" he told me in Nueva Gerona, ""tourism has to be part of the solution."" (Because it is research-based, the Red Alerta program has been unaffected by recent changes to travel for American citizens, but visits have to be arranged through an authorized travel agency or Ocean Doctor.) But La Isla has not shaken off its Cold War past. The Cuban military monitors the various southern nature reserves, and we soon discovered that the whole area had been declared off-limits — no explanation given. The word on the street in Nueva Gerona was that the military was conducting antidrug sweeps along the coast. True or not, there would be no Cocodrilo for us. Time for Plan B. We decided to head to El Colony, the island's only real hotel, which had the misfortune to open the week before the revolution in 1959, and somehow managed to survive the following decades on the dribble of tourism to Cuba, mostly from the Eastern bloc. At the small marina there, we hired a boat to take us to the reserve's limits. Soon we were motoring south with a dive master and a cook. Our first mission was to snorkel off a popular beach called Punto Francés, where two years ago Dr. Guggenheim had seen intact expanses of elkhorn coral, a barometer of reef health. Even an amateur like me could tell that all was not well below the waves. ""That is a wonderful example of a reef that is 90 percent dead,"" Dr. Guggenheim said with a sigh, as we dried off back on board. There had been some bleaching from climate change, he explained, but the main culprit was overfishing, which led to the coral being slowly covered in slimy green algae. ""We treat fish like crops to be harvested,"" he said, ""but they have important jobs to do in the ecosystem. One of them is grazing on algae, which keeps reefs clean."" Things improved radically when we dove to a remote site named El Reino de la Sahara, the King of the Sahara. Rays of sunlight burst down on reefs that were surging with life like underwater cities, including brilliantly colored sea fans and flamingo tongues. A moray eel patrolled the shallows and there were expanses of thriving elkhorn coral. ""That reef was 90 percent healthy, or better,"" Dr. Guggenheim rejoiced. ""But Cuba is in the balance. It could go either way. The good thing is that it has the legal protection,"" he added, noting that 25 percent of Cuba's waters are protected — a higher percentage than the United States, he said (Castro promoted marine protection after he met Jacques Cousteau in the 1980s and became an avid scuba diver). ""But it doesn't have enforcement."" As we motored back to El Colony, Dr. Guggenheim stared out at the sea meditatively. Even in this pristine location, we can only imagine what the Caribbean must have been like when the first Europeans saw it, he mused. ""Only three percent of sea turtles are left today. But when Columbus arrived on his fourth expedition, his son wrote that they saw turtles in such vast numbers that they covered the sea.' Man, I would like to have seen that."" All over La Isla, conversation always returned to Castro, the larger-than-life figure who had been its most notorious (if unwilling) resident, and whose grand plans in the 1970s created its golden age as a tropical youth camp. In one private restaurant, La Casa de Toti, the eponymous owner, known only as Toti, told me how his grandfather was sent to the Model Prison for murder and met Castro there in the 1950s. Along with many other inmates, he was freed a few months after the guerrillas rode into Havana in early 1959. ""So my grandfather was always a big fan of Socialism,"" he said with a wry laugh. The air of melancholy left by so many vanished dreams was present even when I decided to climb a remote mountain known as La Loma on my final morning, to get a glimpse of the island's hard-to-visit south. To get there, I went to meet a farmer-turned-guide Arcadio Castro (no relation), who wore a tattered T-shirt and lived in a marble-floor shack roamed by livestock and piled high with home-bottled mango pulp.  A summer heat wave was descending: By 9 a.m., it was already 95 degrees and 100 percent humidity when Arcadio started hacking the overgrown trail with his rusted machete. Yellow butterflies flitted around us as he fondly remembered the day Fidel Castro visited his high school in 1978. The children were all astonished to see the Maximum Leader bounce a basketball up the stairs to their playground and sink it without effort. (He had been a sports champ in his youth.) In the heyday of the revolution in the 1980s, Arcadio had also served in the Cuban army in Angola and he reminisced about the monstrous bugs he found in Africa. As we climbed, there were glimpses between the palms trees of empty green plains leading to distant mogotes.  By the time we reached the summit, sweat was pouring from us in streams and I was half delirious. The view to the southern nature reserves turned out to be entirely overgrown; Arcadio admitted that he hadn't taken anyone up here in months. I didn't mind. It was oddly comforting to see these remote heights being reclaimed by the wild. The island's man-made hopes have been repeatedly dashed, but hopefully nature will prove resilient. Getting There There are twice daily flights to the Isle of Youth from Havana on Cubana (cubana.cu), the national airline, but they can book up way in advance. Allow a night in Havana before and after the flight in case of cancellations. New travel restrictions imposed by the Trump administration mean that American citizens traveling as tourists should go through an authorized travel agent to ensure compliance (although travel does not need to be in a group, and 12 other categories of travel, such as educational or professional research, are unaffected). Flights and tours can be booked through an international agency such as Cuba Travel Network (cubatravelnetwork.com) or the United States-based Cuba Educational Travel (cubaeducationaltravel.com). On the ground, the best island agency is Ecotur (53-46-32710; reservas.ij@occ.ecotur.tur.cu). Ocean Doctor is expecting to offer educational tours to the wild southern coast in spring (oceandoctor.org/cuba-travel-program/#upcoming; around $5,000 for seven- to 10-day trips.) Where to Stay  l Colony (rates start at $63 for a single person with half board, hotelelcolony.com/en/) is a good base for divers but quite removed from other attractions — and being state-run, has wretched food. Far more satisfying is to stay in one of the casas particulares, private guesthouses, in the town of Nueva Gerona and make day trips. I stayed in the quaint and comfortable Villa Gerona, run by the feisty Diami, (53-4631-2962, villagerona.com; rooms starting at $23). Others can be found on Cuba Junky (cuba-junky.com). Where to Eat The best restaurants on the island are the Buena Vista (Calle 39 #2416A, 53-5503-2666), which has a patio overlooking the Boulevard, and the private paladar Casa de Toti (Calle 3ra #401 near the Presidio Modelo, 53-5277-5565). Tony Perrottet, the author of ""Pagan Holiday,"" is working on a book about the Cuban guerrilla war."

But the protests that have spread to dozens of Iranian cities in the past six days were set off by miscalculations in a long-simmering power struggle between hard-liners and reformers. By Tuesday, Iran's leaders could no longer ignore the demonstrations and felt compelled to respond publicly. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, blamed outside ""enemies"" but did not specify whom. President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, appealed for calm while saying the protesters had a right to be heard. But the anger behind the protests was directed against the entire political establishment. While the protests that swept Iran in 2009 were led by the urban middle class, these protests have been largely driven by disaffected young people in rural areas, towns and small cities who have seized an opening to vent their frustrations with a political elite they say has hijacked the economy to serve its own interests. Unemployment for young people — half the population — runs at 40 percent, analysts believe. Meanwhile, Iran has spent billions of dollars abroad in recent years to extend its influence in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. The initial catalyst for the anger appears to have been the leak by President Rouhani last month of a proposed government budget. For the first time, secret parts of the budget, including details of the country's religious institutes, were exposed. Iranians discovered that billions of dollars were going to hard-line organizations, the military, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, and religious foundations that enrich the clerical elite. At the same time, the budget proposed to end cash subsidies for millions of citizens, increase fuel prices and privatize public schools. The leak appeared to be intended to tap popular resentment, and it worked. Telegram, a social media messaging app used by over 40 million Iranians, blew up with angry comments. ""It made me angry,"" said Mehdi, 33, from Izeh, a town in Iran's poor Khuzestan Province, who asked that his family name not be used out of fear of retaliation. ""There were all these religious organs that received high budgets, while we struggle with constant unemployment."" Last Thursday, hard-liners tried to take back the initiative and embarrass the president, staging a demonstration in the holy city Mashhad, where hundreds chanted slogans against the weak economy and shouted ""death to the dictator"" and ""death to Rouhani."" An Iranian security official confirmed that the Friday prayer leader of the city, Ahmad Alamolhoda, a prominent hard-liner, had been summoned by Iran's National Security Council to explain his role in the demonstration. Videos of the gathering then went viral on social media, where people had for weeks been heatedly discussing the proposed budget. Frustrated Iranians elsewhere were emboldened. In reaction to the protest in Mashhad, Hesamodin Ashna, a trusted adviser to President Rouhani, sent out a Twitter message on Friday, highlighting ""the unbalanced distribution of the budget."" Iran's military forces, active in several countries in the Middle East, saw their budget increase to $11 billion, a nearly 20 percent rise, he said. The budget for representatives of the supreme leader in universities was increased. An institute run by the hard-line cleric Mohammad Taghi Meshbah-Yazdi was to receive eight times as much as a decade ago. Online anger reached a boiling point. For decades, those living in Iran's provincial towns and villages were regarded as the backbone of the country's Islamic regime. They tended to be conservative, averse to change and pious followers of the sober Islamic lifestyle promoted by the state. In less than a decade, all that has changed. A 14-year drought has emptied villages, with residents moving to nearby cities where they often struggle to find jobs. Access to satellite television and, more important, the mobile internet has widened their world. ""On Instagram, I saw a picture of a woman in Tehran with her S.U.V., who wrote she spends $3,000 on her pets each month,"" Mehdi said. ""A person can live here with that money for a year. I got angry."" His city, Izeh, was famous for being home to many who had been exiled by the hard-line judiciary. ""Izeh has changed a lot over the years — more people, but no entertainment, not even a cinema,"" he said. ""Many people use drugs."" On Friday, protests broke out in Izeh. The government news agency said two protesters were killed there by security forces. In Tehran, the capital, Mohammad Alinejad had been sitting behind the wheel of his dilapidated Peugeot when he heard of the protests in Mashhad. ""I was cheering,"" he said. ""I want these clerics to go. They have destroyed my life."" He had been hit by shrapnel during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, and a piece had remained stuck in his head. His status as a handicapped veteran exempts his son from the mandatory 24-month military service, but when he tried to get the exemption papers he got stuck in a bureaucratic merry-go-round that is all too common for Iranians. ""I had to pay bribes, or else no one would help me, and in the end we didn't get anywhere,"" he said. He blamed the clerics for everything: privatization, corruption, inequality and long days with low pay. ""I don't care if our country becomes the next Iraq or Syria,"" he said, ""but I'm so frustrated with them, that I just want them gone and we can think about the consequences tomorrow."" In Qom, the center of Iran's theological educational institutes, one cleric said he was worried about the level of anger. ""People are angry when they see how much money some clerical institutions and Friday prayer leaders are being paid in the budget,"" the cleric, Fazel Meybodi, said. ""Many of them are old and have no appeal to the youths. They must be changed."" As protests took off in about 40 cities across the country, Tehran remained largely quiet. In 2009, over three million people took to the streets disputing the elections. But this time, many said they feared the raging, leaderless protests. ""They are angry, and have a right to be, but there is just nothing more, no plan for the day after,"" said Hamidreza Faraji, a cosmetic and honey salesman who struggles to live a decent life. ""We can't keep on going on to change our leaders,"" he said, standing in his shop, which like others nearby was empty of customers. No one he knew wanted Iran to become the next Syria or Iraq in the chaos that might follow, he explained. ""Many of the protesters shout, ""Neither Gaza nor Lebanon, I will give my life for Iran,"" Mr. Faraji said. ""But we have entered this bad game in the region, so now we have to finish it. Just like we have no other option but to live with our leaders. Unless there is a better alternative."""
News,2018-01-02,Good Tuesday and happy new year!,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/dealbook/2018-business-trump.html,3229," Good Tuesday and happy new year! • Bitcoin's value jumped as Peter Thiel's venture firm emerged as an investor in the currency. • Regulatory concerns sink Ant Financial's purchase of MoneyGram. • The Nasdaq Composite closed above 7,000 for the first time. • Breakingviews thinks 2018 will be a frothy, frustrating year. • The analyst Gene Munster thinks Amazon should make a big leap into brick-and-mortar retail. Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. The value of the digital currency leapt about $1,000 this afternoon. Why? Turns out that the venture capitalist and his firm are believers. From Rob Copeland of the WSJ: Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm's most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $14,655. Why buy Bitcoin? Founders Fund is, after all, a venture firm rather than a hedge fund. But the firm apparently believes that start-up valuations currently are sky-high, while digital currencies will continue to climb in worth. Has Founders Fund made money? The WSJ reports, citing its unnamed sources, that the firm bought about $15 million in Bitcoin and that its stake is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. — Michael J. de la Merced So much for Jack Ma's charm offensive. United States officials have effectively killed Ant Financial's $1.2 billion bid to buy MoneyGram. Ant Financial, the electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, became the latest Chinese firm to have its acquisition of an American company fall apart because it was unable to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius. The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet. Shortly after President Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York City and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs. The attempted purchase of MoneyGram was seen as a test of the Trump administration's political and regulatory approach to China, and the deal's failure could spell trouble for other Chinese companies considering major acquisitions. The strong flow of Chinese money into the United States has prompted growing worries. Lawmakers from both parties have introduced legislation calling for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in the United States. They are pushing for a significant expansion of Cfius, a multiagency panel that reviews foreign deals for potential threats to national security. Of the deal, Richard Beales of Breakingviews writes: ""It would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People's Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam's payments infrastructure. ""For Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing's tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China's financial system. Rather than opening the door – arguably the old American way of showing how things ought to be done – CFIUS this time kept it closed. If it's a rebuke, it's one that's conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment."" MoneyGram's shares are down 6.8 percent after the close. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 percent Tuesday to close above 7,000 for the first time. The gain was driven by Netflix, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet and Apple, which jumped between 18 percent and 4.8 percent. Tuesday's rally follows a 28 percent gain for the Nasdaq last year. That beat the 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average and the 19 percent rise for the Standard & Poor's 500 index. So how stretched are valuations for the Nasdaq? As of Friday, the index was trading at 27.55 times the last 12 months of earnings, well above the S.&P. 500′s level of 18.27 times earnings, according to the WSJ's Ben Eisen. But the Nasdaq's current price-to-earnings ratio remains well below 72.2, which it hit in March 2000. Extra Credit: Yes, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.com drove the Nasdaq's run to 7,000. But Riot Blockchain saw the biggest percentage gain between the Nasdaq's first close above 6,000 in April to its close above 7,000 on Tuesday, writes the WSJ's Chelsey Dulaney. Shares of Riot ""surged more than 640 percent during that period, with the bulk of those gains coming after the company switched its focus to investing in blockchain technology October."" Shot: Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, won't run for re-election, according to the NYT. That gives Mitt Romney — former presidential candidate, former Massachusetts governor, former private equity mogul, current (and increasingly frequent) Trump critic — a chance to run for the seat. Chaser: — Michael J. de la Merced Money is cheap, the global economy is gaining momentum and markets are at records. ""Yet things look less reassuring close up,"" writes Quentin Webb of Breakingviews. ""The populist anger that enabled Trump and Brexit is still simmering, fueled by inequality, disruption, immigration and the echo chambers of social media. An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech's overweening power."" With that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews' predictions for 2018: In investing • ""For the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,"" and ""bond vigilantes will rise from the dead."" • ""Passive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive."" In tech • ""In tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life."" • Apple's position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley's power and lack of accountability. — Stephen Grocer We're just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster. From his note yesterday: Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count. It's a big, if logical, assumption given the ever-expanding empire that Amazon has been assembling — one that has put more and more industry incumbents on their back heels. Target shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon. Could Amazon afford Target? Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Yes, but it'd be pretty expensive. Target's market capitalization as of Tuesday morning was nearly $37 billion. Amazon had about $24.3 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, meaning that the company would have to borrow a hefty amount. Assuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion. Amazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn't struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn't stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals. (Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon's market cap. Obviously, I think it's a bit more complicated than that.) The big caveat (other than price) Obviously, it's antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart's 23 percent. But it's hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration's yardstick for market concentration is: • AT&T and Time Warner say that their proposed deal is a vertical deal that falls within the bounds of acceptable deals. The Justice Department has sued to block that. • Disney and Fox have announced a deal that would inevitably lead to lots of layoffs. President Trump has praised that transaction as potentially ""great for jobs."" ""As for antitrust, the Trump administration won't do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,"" Mr. Munster writes. That's a potentially big assumption. — Michael J. de la Merced Kevin McLaughlin of The Information reports that the two companies ""are actively working to replace Oracle software running on critical business systems with open-source database software alternatives, and have made significant progress toward getting off Oracle entirely,"" citing people familiar with the matter. ""A mass exodus from the Oracle database isn't likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives."" Oracle's shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report. — Stephen Grocer The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017. Does that mean investors should turn bearish on stocks this year? The answer is no if history is any indicator, LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick points out. Also, is the first day of trading predictive of the stock market's performance for the full year? — Stephen Grocer If you couldn't recall last year's highlights over the recent holidays, Andrew can remind you with his annual year-end column (the humor of which is his and his alone). A sample: The seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump's Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon's second headquarters. But it's a new year, and here are some important story lines we'll be keeping our eyes on: • Now that the tax fight is over, the White House is turning to trade. Will Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin be able to tame President Trump's hard-line tendencies? • Can Congress make progress on the many, many other issues it's facing? • SoftBank did its Uber deal. Will the ride-hailing giant make further strides toward going public this year? (Maybe not.) And what will Masa Son of SoftBank and his $100 billion Vision Fund get up to? • What other industries will Amazon disrupt this year? And how much bigger can Mr. Bezos's behemoth get? • North Korea is trying to drive a wedge between South Korea and the U.S. And it seems to be working. How will Mr. Trump — and the global economy — respond? • Stevie Cohen is finding takers for his new hedge fund. But how much presence will he retain in the industry? • In the world of M. & A. fights, who will AT&T or the Justice Department prevail? Broadcom or Qualcomm? And will Disney and Fox get their deal done? And the Trump administration's deregulatory push looks to be a reason for that — even if skeptics question whether rolling back government rules stimulates corporate growth. Corporate leaders always cite ""uncertainty"" as a reason to hold back on capital expenditures or transformative acquisitions. And fewer than half of the respondents in the National Association of Manufacturers' most recent survey said they faced an ""unfavorable business climate."" Yet some see a bigger phenomenon at work. This is what Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics told the NYT: ""The fundamental backdrop here is that this is a global synchronized expansion lifting everyone's spirits, from Tokyo to New York."" The tax flyaround • Corporate America's great loophole scavenger hunt has begun. (NYT) • China has responded to the tax law by temporarily exempting foreign companies from taxes on their earnings in the country — but there's a catch. (NYT) • Democrats in high-tax states are seeking ways to blunt some of the impact of the tax overhaul. (NYT) • The gig economy could get a boost. (NYT) • Betting on the dollar continuing to strengthen in 2018, thanks to the tax law. (WSJ) The Murdoch family tensions behind the Disney deal. It may have been a brief sales negotiation with Verizon that prompted Rupert Murdoch to consider selling pieces of 21st Century Fox. But the NYT reports that friction between the media mogul and his son James helped push the family toward the Disney transaction. From the article by Brooks Barnes and Sydney Ember: • James Murdoch has privately grumbled about the control that his father still exerted at Fox and has chafed at some of the elements of Fox News's coverage. • Rupert Murdoch was wary of how Hollywood was being reshaped by digital giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon, and unsure his empire could compete. • Lachlan Murdoch, who is more conservative than his brother, has become the heir apparent at what would remain of Fox, but was initially uneasy about a sell-off. What they gain: Beyond easing family tensions among the trio, the deal could make the Murdochs some of Disney's biggest shareholders. Yes, Ron Baron has lowered fees on some of his smaller funds. But he's unapologetic about charging roughly 54 percent more than the industry average. Here's what he told Landon Thomas Jr. of the NYT: ""Since inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,"" he said in an interview. ""If you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us."" How he (and other mutual funds) do it: Chalk it up to a combination of looser oversight, the $10 trillion of investor money still dedicated to actively managed funds and a lack of investor awareness that high fees don't necessarily pay for performance. Can this go on?  One fund investor's take in the NYT: ""I won't say performance warrants the fees they charge,"" said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. ""But I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition."" Bruce Steinberg, an executive at the hedge fund, and his family were among the 12 killed when a single-engine plane crashed in Costa Rica on Sunday. Ray Dalio of Bridgewater posted this to Facebook yesterday: Also of note: Richard Cousins, the C.E.O. of Compass Group, the world's biggest catering company, was one of six killed in a plane crash in Sydney on Sunday. What's notable is that Time's Up — formed by more than 300 women and including a legal-defense fund — isn't focused only on the entertainment industry. It plans to offer help to janitors, nurses, hotel staff and other blue-collar workers. Here's what Shonda Rhimes, a backer of the initiative, told Cara Buckley of the NYT: ""If this group of women can't fight for a model for other women who don't have as much power and privilege, then who can?"" Who else is involved: The actresses America Ferrera, Eva Longoria and Reese Witherspoon; Donna Langley, the chairwoman of Universal Pictures; and roughly 295 other women in Hollywood. What's different: The Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, which is backed by $13 million in donations and is overseen by Tina Tchen, a former chief of staff to Michelle Obama. It will help provide less-privileged women with lawyers to bring misconduct cases to court and protect them from blowback.

(NYT) Last week, the NYT reported on how the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ends up with some of the highest construction costs in the world. Some facts: • The Second Avenue subway cost $2.5 billion. Expanding Grand Central Terminal is now expected to cost $12 billion. • Construction companies inflate their projected costs by up to 50 percent for M.T.A. work. Labor unions have arranged for up to four times the necessary staffing on some projects. • Consultants have persuaded officials to spend heavily on design and management.

News,2018-01-02,"SALT LAKE CITY — More than three years after construction was started to rebuild Salt Lake City International Airport and scrape away a collection of obsolete terminals, the contours of one of the nation’s largest air travel infrastructure projects are taking shape.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/salt-lake-city-airport-renovation.html,1138," SALT LAKE CITY — More than three years after construction was started to rebuild Salt Lake City International Airport and scrape away a collection of obsolete terminals, the contours of one of the nation's largest air travel infrastructure projects are taking shape. The project is part of the $10 billion a year that airports invest to modernize infrastructure in the United States, according to the Airports Council International-North America, a trade group in Washington. And the extensive renovation could help reduce public embarrassment about the condition of aging airports in the United States that cannot keep up with demand. In 2014, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. compared New York's LaGuardia Airport to ""some third-world country."" The $3.6 billion airport reconstruction project here is so big that it looks like a city emerging from the high plains along Utah's Wasatch Mountains. Concrete pillars for the new 908,000-square-foot, $365 million main terminal and for a $158.4 million, 1.7 million-square-foot parking deck are in place. The steel outlines of the first half of the $671.6 million, 827,000-square-foot South Concourse are also set. Nearly 1,000 construction workers and a battalion of vehicles and equipment are deployed on the 300-acre construction site. A second concourse of 477,00 square feet will be constructed at a cost of $545.5 million to the north between the runways. One existing 990-foot tunnel, and a second, new one of the same length, will link the two concourses at a cost of nearly $140 million. The airport is spending more than $90 million to construct 14 miles of new roadway. A station for the light-rail line connecting the airport to downtown Salt Lake City will be moved closer to the new terminal. When the facilities are finished in 2023, they will provide this fast-growing metropolitan area, home to 80 percent of Utah's three million residents, with improved efficiency at one of the country's busiest airports, serving nine airlines with 329 daily flights. Traffic has climbed to more than 23 million travelers annually in an airport designed to serve fewer than half that number. To ease congestion, Delta Air Lines, which serves 70 percent of the airport's passengers, agreed to help finance the reconstruction. ""Planning for this project goes back to the early 2000s master plan, when we were thinking about how to make the existing airport layout work,"" said Bill Wyatt, the airport's executive director. ""Delta sat down and also tried to think how they could make that work operationally. They concluded they couldn't make it work operationally. Everybody began to focus on this new concept, which we're building."" Delta, which earned $39.6 billon in total revenue in 2016, uses the hub principally as a link between coastal and mountain cities. Delta's investment in the airport is a share of the $1.2 billion the airline is spending annually over the next decade to expand and modernize air transport facilities around the country, according to company figures. The money would be spent on airport projects in Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, Salt Lake City and Seattle, Morgan Durrant, a company spokesman, said in an email message. Mike Williams, the program director for the airport's Terminal Redevelopment Program, said the nationwide airport reconstruction effort started in 2008, as the country was in the grip of the Great Recession. Three years after a downturn in the American airline industry pitched Delta into bankruptcy in 2005, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport started to build its $1.4 billion, 1.2 million-square-foot Maynard H. Jackson Jr. International Terminal. The Atlanta terminal opened in 2012 just as fuel prices moderated, the national economy recovered and Americans began filling airline seats and overcrowding the country's old airports. In the same period, Los Angeles International Airport began a $14 billion project to upgrade runways and safety facilities, improve escalators and elevators and renovate four terminals. The project included a $2.1 billion remodeling and expansion of the international terminal and the addition of a $1.6 billion, 750,000-square-foot midfield terminal. Expansion is needed. In 2016, 823 million passengers boarded airliners in the United States, 25 million more than in the previous year. Airport and airline executives, mindful of criticism about old facilities and responsive to the growing demand, have escalated construction projects into a nationwide building boom, with New York-area airports leading the way. LaGuardia is spending $8 billion to replace four terminals with one, build a new parking structure, connect the airport more efficiently to public transit and gain more space for taxiways. Newark Liberty International Airport just broke ground on a $2.4 billion project, much of the money to be spent replacing 44-year-old Terminal A with a one-million-square-foot facility and a 3,000-space parking deck. And Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced a $10 billion project this year to renovate and expand passenger terminals and improve ground transportation at Kennedy International Airport. Other big airport construction projects include an investment of nearly $800 million at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to build a 450,000-square-foot international terminal to replace one that dates to the 1970s. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport broke ground almost two years ago on a $807 million, 760,000-square-foot terminal. And Orlando International Airport is in the midst of a $1.1 billion renovation and expansion of its North Terminal, as well as improvements to other facilities. Rebuilding the Salt Lake City airport has attracted broad support from residents, not only because it is financed almost entirely without taxpayer funds but also because the new terminals will enhance one of the most conveniently situated major airports in the country. From almost anywhere in the city or its outskirts, the airport is less than a half-hour car or train ride away. Two features of design and construction distinguish the reconstruction: its linear layout, and the lack of disruption to the airport's operation. When the project is finished, the airport will consist of an airy central terminal flanked by the two wings of its 3,700-foot-long South Concourse. In front of that will be the 3,400-foot-long North Concourse. The unbent concourses, designed by the architecture and engineering firm HOK, are characteristic of airport reconstruction projects to accommodate big planes. The three old terminals, dating to the 1960s, are connected by an outdoor sidewalk and were upgraded sporadically through the decades with clusters of gates served by fans of tightly spaced jet bridges. The project can occur without disruption because the 7,800-acre airport has enough room to build all the new facilities, including the first wing of the South Concourse. When gates in the new concourses are ready to serve passengers, the airport will close and demolish the old terminals, then build the rest of the South Concourse. ""It's a very flexible and efficient design,"" Mr. Wyatt said. ""If we need more space after the initial phase of construction, you can add capacity as far as the eye can see, virtually without any disruption at all."""

In July 1999, the peaceful protest of students over freedom of speech spread into a considerable uprising. In June 2009, people took to streets to demand a recount of disputed votes in the presidential election, which began the Green Movement. Those were both pushes for civil rights, demanding more flexibility and accountability from the government. They took place largely in Tehran, and attracted the middle class and the university educated. Both were peaceful and persistently nonviolent. The current unrest looks different. So far, the middle class and the highly educated have been more witnesses than participants. Nonviolence is not a sacred principle. The protests first intensified in small religious towns all over the country, where the government used to take its support for granted. Metropolitan areas have so far lagged behind. Demands like freedom of speech and the rights of women and religious minorities have, for the most part, been either absent or vaguely implied. In one of the rare videos of protesters talking to the news media, they all mention unemployment, inflation and the looting of national wealth: A woman asks President Hassan Rouhani to live on only her salary of $300 a month; a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war says he considers himself among ""the forgotten""; an elderly woman talks about her 75-year-old husband, who works long hours to make ends meet. The chants are also different this time. ""Where is my vote?"" and ""Free political prisoners!"" dominated in 2009. Today they have been replaced with ""No to inflation!"" and ""Down with embezzlers!"" and ""Leave the country alone, mullahs."" Protests over economic grievances are hardly new in Iran: riots over inflation in Islamshahr and Mashad in the 1990s, frequent strikes by the bus drivers union in the 2000s, protests by schoolteachers over unpaid wages. Those voices were barely heard. They came from the bottom of society and were either stifled halfway through by the government or drowned out by civil rights activists with better access to the international media. They have now forced their way to the surface and emerged as a resonant, nationwide cry for justice and equality. Since the 1979 revolution, Iranian politics has been defined by a split between reformists and principlists, conservatives who say they are devoted to the principles of the revolution. During the 1999 and 2009 uprisings, the protesters enjoyed support from powerful reformists. This time, the dichotomy has been transcended. The demonstrators don't want support from anyone associated with the status quo, including Mr. Rouhani, the reformist president. No wonder prominent reformist figures, even Ebrahim Nabavi, a dissident journalist living in exile, disparaged the protesters as ""the potato-eating mob."" Iranian economists and intellectuals have long warned that something like this could happen. Even the figures relatively close to the government set off the alarm. In early 2015, Mohsen Renani, professor of economy at the University of Isfahan, wrote an open letter to the Guardian Council, Iran's highest clerical body and one of the country's most powerful institutions, expressing deep concern over rising inflation and government incompetence. Mr. Renani predicted that if issues like growing unemployment were not addressed within two years, Iran would face turmoil. Parviz Sedaghat, another prominent political economist, published an article just before the protests broke out discussing how Iran's economic system has produced first-class and second-class citizens, and warning that some government institutions have become economic conglomerates more powerful than the state. A detailed study published last month by the BBC's Farsi-language service demonstrated the alarming decline of household income over the past decade. Mr. Rouhani's austerity budget, submitted to Parliament on Dec. 10, only poured fuel on the rising fire. Unlike during the first decades of the post-revolutionary Iran, the rich now heedlessly flaunt their wealth. Until the mid-2000s, the gentlemen's agreement among the embezzlers held that they keep a modest appearance at home and launder their money in Dubai and Toronto. In the most famous case, Mahmoud Reza Khavari, the former managing director of Bank Melli, made off with hundreds of millions of dollars and became a real estate mogul in Toronto. That generation cared about appearances and never dropped the veneer of fealty to the ideals of the 1979 revolution. Their millennial offspring, on the other hand, hardly care. Wealthy young Iranians act like a new aristocratic class unaware of the sources of their wealth. They brazenly drive Porsches and Maseratis through the streets of Tehran before the eyes of the poor and post about their wealth on Instagram. The photos travel across apps and social media and enrage the hardworking people in other cities. Iranians see pictures of the family members of the authorities drinking and hanging out on beaches around the world, while their daughters are arrested over a fallen head scarf and their sons are jailed for buying alcohol. The double standard has cultivated an enormous public humiliation. The people today at the top of power pyramid in Iran were involved in the 1979 revolution and witnessed firsthand how, when the shah decided he had ""heard the voice of the revolution,"" he marked the beginning of his end. That impression has been reinforced by the Arab Spring: Zine el-Abedine Bin Ali of Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt tried to appease protesters and were forced from power. Bashar al-Assad of Syria never even recognized the existence of opposition and he remains in office. Iran has lived through multiple convulsions. The government has mastered the art of survival through crises. They may well survive this round as well but something has fundamentally changed: The unquestioning support of the rural people they relied on against the discontent of the metropolitan elite is no more. Now everyone seems unhappy."
briefing,2018-01-03,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/briefing/iran-north-korea-donald-trump.html,1142," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: • Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blamed the country's foreign ""enemies"" for a wave of deadly protests. He did not identify those foes but said that he would address the Iranian people ""when the time is right."" The protests, increasingly aimed at the country's leaders, were set off by miscalculations in a long-simmering power struggle between hard-liners and reformers, our correspondent reports from Tehran. In a video, we look at how the current unrest differs from that in 2009. President Emmanuel Macron of France urged the Iranian government to show restraint. Meanwhile, the Trump administration expressed its support for the protesters and called for an end to restrictions on the internet. _____ • President Trump taunted Kim Jong-un over North Korea's arsenal: ""I too have a Nuclear Button,"" Mr. Trump tweeted, ""but it is a much bigger & more powerful one."" (Reactions on social media steered in a predictable direction.) He also threatened to withhold aid to Palestinians and Pakistan and  referred to his own Justice Department as ""deep state."" (Pakistan dismissed Mr. Trump's outburst as ""incomprehensible."") Separately in Washington, Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican senator and one of Mr. Trump's allies, said he would retire. The open seat creates an opportunity for Mitt Romney, a Trump critic, to run. _____ • Fake news is most likely to be read by older and more conservative Americans, according to a new study. Researchers analyzed the browsing histories of thousands of American adults during the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. The study found that even those most likely to read demonstrably false news stories online still received most of their news from the mainstream media. Facebook, by far, was the platform from which people most often navigated to a fake news site, according to researchers. _____ • The Dutch are living longer than previous generations, and often alone. New courses, which teach the elderly not only how to avoid falling but also how to fall correctly, are gaining popularity. Such classes are now common enough that the government rates them. (In one exercise, above, the students start by lowering themselves slowly onto mats. Over several weeks, they learn to fall without injuring themselves.) • Researchers in Finland have developed artificial intelligence that can generate images of celebrity look-alikes and a way to test the believability of such images. • In the European Union, a new set of rules, known as MiFID II, which extends transparency requirements beyond stocks to bonds, commodities and derivatives, takes effect today. • China is suspending the production of more than 500 car models that do not meet its fuel economy standards. • Our DealBook columnist looks at 2017's biggest deals and biggest winners. The DealBook team also took a look at key story lines for the next 12 months, including trade fights, Uber and North Korea. • Here's a snapshot of global markets. • Prosecutors in Germany are looking into complaints that two far-right lawmakers who used Twitter violated the country's newly strengthened hate speech laws. The politicians say they are being censored. [The New York Times] • The Israeli left expressed relief over the removal of wording in a bill that would have made it easier to redraw the Jerusalem map to exclude Palestinians. [The New York Times] • Bulgaria's president vetoed a bill that would establish a special antigraft unit, arguing that investigators wouldn't be sufficiently sheltered from political interference. [Reuters] • China's demand for donkey hides, to produce a gelatin used in traditional medicine, is disrupting livelihoods in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa. [The New York Times] • ""I was misguided."" A YouTube star with millions of followers apologized for posting a video that showed a dead body. [The New York Times] • Our food critic writes that revelations of sexual harassment are playing out ""excruciatingly slowly,"" if at all, in the restaurant world. [The New York Times] Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • We've long known that dietary fiber is good for us. New research explains why. • To usher in the new year, we asked creative people to share the homemade recipes they count on to detox. Here's a cleansing juice from the Missoni family. • Recipe of the day: Try pan-roasted cauliflower with garlic, parsley and rosemary. • Researchers are using treadmills to measure sea turtles' impressive stamina. • In tennis news, Andy Murray's participation in the Australian Open is in doubt because of a lingering hip problem. • Tottenham, a diverse neighborhood in London, is caught in one of the city's largest ever redevelopment programs. Some residents fear that gentrification could force them out. • Ukraine was once a vital part of the Soviet space program. The nation still holds on to its proud scientific traditions. • Finally, have a laugh at our 360-video bloopers. Here are moments that didn't make the cut. ""Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy … how can I ever forget them?"" Those were Charles M. Schulz's parting words in the final daily ""Peanuts"" comic strip, which ran 18 years ago today. They recalled a slightly less sentimental line from the strip's debut, nearly 50 years earlier, in which a carefree Charlie Brown strolls by a pair of children. ""Good ol' Charlie Brown,"" one says. ""How I hate him!"" That juxtaposition of earnestness and wry humor made ""Peanuts"" a pop-cultural mainstay for half a century, reaching 75 countries in 21 languages at its peak. Mr. Schulz, shown above in 1966, insisted on producing every aspect of the comic, making himself inseparable from his characters. ""I want it to be my words in everything I do,"" he told The Times in 1967. ""I've thought of it — hiring someone to help. Sometimes I think it would be nice. But then — what would be the point?"" When colon cancer forced Mr. Schulz to end the daily strip in 2000 at age 77, The Times invoked a dismal Charlie Brown, mourning the end of the baseball season: ""There's a dreariness in the air that depresses me."" Mr. Schulz died a month later, but all 17,897 ""Peanuts"" strips would be anthologized over the next two decades.

News,2018-01-03,"TEHRAN — When they stepped through the gates of Tehran University last week, the student protesters had every expectation of igniting an impassioned rally against the government.

After all, the university grounds had long been a flash point for demonstrations in the capital. But this time, their exhortations went unheeded. ""Proud Iranians, support us,"" they shouted, only to find pedestrians walking by, looking to see what the commotion was about but declining to join the protesters. The protests that broke out a week ago in other parts of Iran — but never gained traction in the capital — have shown some signs of abating, though demonstrators are still taking to the streets after dark in many outlying provinces. Elite forces with the Revolutionary Guards Corps were deployed to three of them on Wednesday — Hamadan, Isfahan and Lorestan — to help quell uprisings there. The government took another step on Wednesday to tamp down the uprising, staging pro-government rallies throughout the country and affording them generous coverage on state-controlled media. But little of the action, either for or against the government, has found its way to the capital. That stands in sharp contrast to 2009, when millions of middle-class people in Tehran erupted in anger over an election they saw as rigged, churning into the streets for months of anti-government protests that came to be called the Green Movement. But this time, as protests over the poor economy erupted in more than 80 cities over the past week and evolved into a condemnation of the political system and its clerical rulers, Tehran remained curiously muted. There have been some gatherings, but relatively few and drawing only a few hundred at a time, a lack of interest that has confounded many residents. About 500 people have been arrested in Tehran, a figure that pales in comparison to 2009. To some extent, some say, the difference may reflect a divide between Iran's urban and rural populations, with more sophisticated city dwellers dismissing the leaderless provincial protests as too violent and undisciplined. Others see the chaos and violence in nearby Syria, and worry about what could happen if Iran suffered a similar breakdown in authority. Still others, having gone through the 2009 protests and the brutal repression that finally contained the uprising, say they are willing to work patiently to wring economic and political concessions from the clerical government. In a series of interviews, Tehran residents said they were just as upset as anyone else over the country's widespread corruption, high unemployment and lack of freedoms, but most also said they did not know anyone who had joined a protest in recent days. ""Maybe it's the presence of security forces,"" said Farhad, a 33-year cybersecurity expert who refused to give his surname for fear of reprisals by the authorities. ""Or maybe Tehranis are just not interested."" In 2009 they were interested. Millions marched in protest against the state, holding up green ribbons and posters asking, ""Where is my vote?"" Young people, women and intellectuals were all furious over President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election, which they said was fraudulent. Led initially by two defeated opposition presidential candidates, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, they took to the streets, facing heavily armed security forces. The protests rocked the Islamic republic to its core. Around 150 people were killed, thousands were arrested, and intellectuals, journalists and politicians were tried in Stalinist-type mass proceedings, many of them forced to make humiliating public confessions of wrongdoing. Two protesters were executed. In those days, Ali Sabzevari, now 33, joined every protest. ""We were fighting for our rights and our future, but we had structure and a plan,"" he said. But this time around, older, a bit heavier and wiser, he said the protests held no attraction for him. ""Those people do not know what they want. They have no clear idea, and I don't like their slogans,"" he said. ""I want our society to open up, more democracy, but I don't see how violent protests will achieve that."" Others shared that view, and worried about playing into the hands of widely detested Western leaders like President Trump and Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. ""These people definitely have the right to protest,"" Shervin Bashari, 32, said of the Iranian demonstrators, ""but I do not want to join something and have Trump and Nethanyahu exploit it for their own purposes."" Mr. Trump has posted several Twitter messages supporting the protesters, saying the United States will come to their aid at the right time. ""I don't want to support chaos either,"" said Mr. Bashari, who sells imported heating equipment. ""Protest should be peaceful and with minimal costs. Now 21 people, including two children, have died, and for what?"" The Green Movement and the security clampdown that followed left a deep scar on all those involved. Many protest leaders spent years in jail under harsh conditions, and Tehran endured a heavy police presence. In 2011, the leaders of the protest — Mr. Moussavi, his wife, Zahra Rahnavard, and Mr. Karroubi — were placed under house arrest without a trial. They have remained there since, and have only recently been allowed to receive selected visitors. The election of a moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, in 2013, — celebrated with huge street parties in Tehran and other middle-class cities — was seen by many as an end to that period. The subsequent signing of the nuclear agreement and the lifting of international sanctions was similarly celebrated by educated urbanites, who in many ways set the cultural and social norms in the country. Many have since grown disillusioned with Mr. Rouhani, even after his re-election this year. He has failed to fulfill election promises like appointing three women as ministers (so far, none have been named), and the nuclear pact has not produced the economic boom he promised. Yet, no matter how sour their feelings about Mr. Rouhani, most reform-minded people in Tehran are sticking by him. Leili Rashidi, a prominent Iranian actress, is typical of this group. One of the best-known figures to join the 2009 protests, a potentially career-threatening decision, Mrs. Rashidi says she has no interest in joining the current protests. Having campaigned for Mr. Rouhani's re-election in May, she says she is not ready to desert him. ""He is not perfect,"" she said, ""but he is the only way forward."" She said her friends all agreed with her that efforts to overthrow the system would lead nowhere. ""I sympathize with the problems of the protesters who want a better standard of living, jobs and less economic hardship,"" she said. ""But change must come gradually, I've learned. With least pain, peacefully, not through violence."
News,2018-01-03,"Long before it became an archaic, filthy, profligate symbol of everything wrong with our broken cities, New York’s subway was a marvel — a mad feat of engineering and an audacious gamble on a preposterously ambitious vision. “The effect it is to have on the city of New York is something larger than any mind can realize,” said William Gaynor, the New York mayor who set in motion the primary phase of its construction.

""The effect it is to have on the city of New York is something larger than any mind can realize,"" said William Gaynor, the New York mayor who set in motion the primary phase of its construction. A public-works project of this scale had never before been undertaken in the United States, and even now, more than a century later, it is hard to fully appreciate what it did for the city and, really, the nation. Before the subway, it was by no means a foregone conclusion that New York would become the greatest city on earth. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants fleeing poverty and persecution were arriving on its doorstep every year, but most of them were effectively marooned, herded into dark, squalid tenements in disease-ridden slums. The five boroughs had recently been joined as one city, but the farms and villages of Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens might as well have been on the other side of the planet from Manhattan's teeming streets. Bound up in the fate of the city were even larger questions: Would America be able to manage the transition from the individualism and insularity that defined its 19th-century frontiers to the creative collaboration and competition of its fast-growing urban centers? Could it adapt and excel in this rapidly changing world? Were cities the past or the future of civilization? And then came the subway: hundreds of miles of track shooting out in every direction, carrying millions of immigrants out of the ghettos and into newly built homes, tying together the modern city and enabling it to become a place where anything was possible. It was the arrival of the subway that transformed a seedy neighborhood called Longacre Square into Times Square, that helped turn a single square mile surrounding the Wall Street station into the center of global finance, that made Coney Island an amusement park for the masses. It was the subway that fueled the astonishing economic growth that built the city's iconic skyscrapers. Other cities had subways, but none threaded through nearly as many neighborhoods as New York's, enabling it to move large numbers of workers between Manhattan and the middle-class boroughs — a cycle that repeated itself every day, generating ever more wealth and drawing in ever more people. As New York evolved over the decades, the subway was the one constant, the very thing that made it possible to repurpose 19th-century factories and warehouses as offices or condominiums, or to reimagine a two-mile spit of land between Manhattan and Queens that once housed a smallpox hospital as a high-tech university hub. When the city is in crisis — financial or emotional — the subway is always a crucial part of the solution. The subway led the city's recovery from the fiscal calamity of the 1970s. The subway was at the center of the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks. The subway got New York back to work after the most devastating storm in the city's history just five years ago. The questions we are facing today are not so different from the ones our predecessors faced 100 years ago. Can the gap between rich and poor be closed, or is it destined to continue to widen? Can we put the future needs of a city and a nation above the narrow, present-day interests of a few? Can we use a portion of the monumental sums of wealth that we are generating to invest in an inclusive and competitive future? The answer to all of these questions is still rumbling beneath New York City. For all the changes in transportation technology since the first tunnels were dug — the rise of the automobile, the proliferation of bike lanes and ferries, our growing addiction to ride-hailing apps and dreams of a future filled with autonomous vehicles — the subway remains the only way to move large numbers of people around the city. Today, New York's subway carries close to six million people every day, more than twice the entire population of Chicago. The subway may no longer be a technological marvel, but it continues to perform a daily magic trick: It brings people together, but it also spreads people out. It is this paradox — these constant expansions and contractions, like a beating heart — that keep the human capital flowing and the city growing. New York's subway has no zones and no hours of operation. It connects rich and poor neighborhoods alike. The subway has never been segregated. It is always open, and the fare is always the same no matter how far you need to go. In New York, movement — anywhere, anytime — is a right. Most countries treat subway systems as national assets. They understand that their cities are their great wealth creators and equality enablers and that cities don't work without subways. The public-private corporation that runs Hong Kong's subway expects 99.9 percent of its trains to run on time, and they do. (If you are traveling to the airport, you can also check your luggage at a central downtown train station and not see it again until you've landed at your destination. Imagine!) China has been feverishly building new metro systems in cities across the country, a recognition that subways are the only way to keep pace with the nation's rapid urbanization and the needs of its citizens. And it's not just new cities that are seeing major investments in their subways. Two decades ago, the decline of London's Underground became a national crisis; now it's moving toward running driverless trains. For that matter, Los Angeles — Los Angeles — recently embarked on a 40-year, $120 billion project to build out its mass-transit system. New York City's subway, meanwhile, is falling apart. If you are a regular rider, you know this firsthand. But even if you aren't, it has probably become difficult to ignore all the stories about the system's failure: the F train that was trapped between stations for close to an hour without power or air conditioning, the Q train that derailed in Brooklyn, the track fire on the A line in Harlem that sent nine passengers to the hospital. The cumulative impression of all these miserable underground experiences — and all these stories about miserable underground experiences — is that the situation is hopeless, that the subway cannot be fixed. The subway has been wrecked, and in this era of short-term thinking and government mistrust, public-works projects with benefits larger than any single mind can realize are no longer possible. But it is possible to fix the subway. And we must. Our failure to do so would be a collective and historic act of self-destruction. I. WHO WRECKED THE SUBWAY? The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the government agency that operates the subway, uses the catchall word ""incident"" to describe all the various events that impede the system's healthy functioning. Every one of these incidents triggers an investigation resulting in an incident report, a minute-by-minute account of what went wrong and the steps taken to resolve the issue. Thousands of these reports are produced every month. A random sampling of incidents from a single recent day include: ""Signal Trouble,"" ""Switch Trouble,"" ""Unruly Person(s),"" ""Track Circuit Failure,"" ""Delayed by Track/Work Gangs,"" ""Water Condition,"" ""Fire/Smoke Conditions,"" ""Debris on Roadbed,"" ""Brakes Fail to Charge"" and ""Sparks Issuing."" Among the most common were ""Excess Dwell Time"" and ""Insufficient Capacity/Crowding."" Translation: too many passengers, not enough trains. All these problems lead to one really big problem: The trains are terminally late, obstructed daily by a cascade of system failures. During the first three months of 2017, three-quarters of the subway's lines were chronically behind schedule. The worst offender, the 2 train, was late nearly 70 percent of the time. For a delayed rider wondering whom to blame, it's tempting to begin with the people you can see, the 7,000 or so men and women — track cleaners, inspectors, flaggers and other orange-vested M.T.A. employees — charged with preventing these incidents and keeping the trains moving. On a steamy morning in August, I sat among a small group of them in a dingy, defunct public elementary school in Gravesend, Brooklyn, that serves as the M.T.A.'s Transit Learning Center. Taped to the classroom wall were yellowing tabloid clips of a different kind of subway horror story — ""MAN UNDER!, RAIL HORROR: HIT THIRD TRACK AND LIVED!"" — a tableau that lent the one-day safety course, a requirement for all M.T.A. employees and contractors, some of the flavor of those grisly low-budget driver's-ed videos designed to scare teenagers straight. ""If you should do something silly today, like get hit by a train, you cannot sue New York City Transit,"" my instructor, Jim Fortin, said as he distributed release forms to the class. It's a common occurrence: A passenger is killed on the tracks pretty much every week. The course would end with a walk on a live track. If I survived the day, I would receive a laminated license qualifying me to work in the tunnels of the New York City subway system — ""in the hole,"" as it is known. Fortin walked us through the potential hazards that awaited us. He taught us the proper arm motions to use if we ever found ourselves needing to signal to an oncoming train to stop. After a short multiple-choice test and a break for lunch, we were issued orange vests, flashlights, helmets and safety goggles. Our group walked to a nearby N station, rode a few stops, transferred to the R and got off at 53rd Street, where we walked to the end of the platform and climbed down a ladder onto the tracks. Fortin soon directed us to what he called ""clear-up spots,"" small, shallow openings built into the walls of the narrow tunnels that we had been taught that morning to identify. A train was coming. I stuffed my flashlight into my back pocket and tucked myself into the tiny space, remembering Fortin's instructions: ""Get in. Get centered. Don't move."" I could hear the train approaching and see its headlight out of the corner of my eye. In about 30 seconds a string of 45-ton steel cars was thundering by, just 18 inches from my frozen body. It was terrifying, but also thrilling, like the entire industrial revolution was speeding past my face. At point-blank range, subway cars seem invincible. In fact, they can be laid low by something as insignificant as a broken bolt or a can of soda — which, when resting against the third rail, might heat up and ignite a scrap of newspaper, causing a track fire, the source of hundreds of delays every month. Every inch of the system's rails is supposed to be checked twice a week for imperfections. Much of this work happens overnight, when the frequency of trains on this 24-hour system decreases and workers are able to move more freely on the tracks. ""While the rest of the city is sleeping, there's a whole industrial ballet going on underground that most people have no idea about,"" John Samuelsen, a track inspector who now runs the Transport Workers Union of America, told me. ""It's like friggin' Brigadoon down there."" And yet a recent study found that only 3 percent of the tracks in stations meet the M.T.A.'s own standards for cleanliness. Workers face an even more insidious challenge than trash in the form of water. Many parts of the system are below the water table, and its lines course through neighborhoods that were once lush farmland. On a dry day, the M.T.A. pumps 13 million gallons of water from the system. Over time, the water corrodes the system, rusting and rotting its infrastructure — and yet sealing and grouting these leaks often requires rerouting service on lines, further frustrating riders. Next year, the L train will begin a shutdown that will last at least 15 months for repairs to its East River tunnel, which flooded during Hurricane Sandy. Some 225,000 people will have to find a new way to get in and out of Manhattan every day. No matter how diligent they may be, 7,000-odd orange-vested maintenance workers are simply not enough to keep the deteriorating system — with its 665 miles of passenger-carrying track, enough to reach all the way to Indianapolis — on schedule. All the real problems must begin elsewhere, further up the chain of command. Pretty much every decision that destroys your commute happens not below ground but above it, in an unmarked building on the West Side of Manhattan called the Rail Control Center. Here, men and women sit at computer consoles behind large wall-mounted schematic track and station displays in a high-ceilinged, windowless command space, directing the changes — moving a local train to an express track, taking a train out of service — that determine the daily transportation fate of thousands, sometimes millions, of passengers. When I visited the facility several months ago, I was greeted by the official who oversees all these disruptions, Barry Greenblatt. A tall, slender man in a gray suit with two Bic pens in his shirt pocket and a silver tie clip so tarnished that you barely make out the letters on it — ""M.T.A."" — Greenblatt is the authority's vice president and chief officer for service delivery, Department of Subways. It's his job to run the trains. Greenblatt, a 31-year veteran of the M.T.A., grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, without a car. ""I started riding trains and buses by myself pretty much from the time I was 5 years old,"" he told me after we settled into a conference room overlooking the command center. He became a bus driver when he graduated from college, fulfilling a childhood dream, and has been an employee of the M.T.A. ever since, gradually moving up the ladder to his current position. ""We operate the trains,"" he said. ""We try to run them on time — 5.66 million average daily riders, 1.7 billion annual riders. Right now, there are 585 trains out there. We will run 8,477 one-way trips over the course of a day. We hope to have 8,477 on-time trains. We're not going to do it today."" Greenblatt's morning began with a 2:30 a.m. phone call: An operator moving a train out of storage at a yard in East New York, Brooklyn, had driven through a stop signal, damaging the switch beneath him. ""The first question we would ask is whether it is going to have any impact on service,"" Greenblatt said. A few hours later, at 5:10 a.m., he received a text message about another incident: A passenger had called from the Park Place station, near City Hall, to report that there was smoke on the tracks. Seven minutes later, the New York City Police Department reported via an internal-communications line known as ""the 6 Wire"" that a transformer may have exploded in the station. Greenblatt managed the response. Service on the 2 and 3 lines was rerouted, and several teams were deployed to Park Place to figure out what was going on. They soon discovered that a chunk of metal, about 18 inches long, had fallen onto the tracks, breaking through the third-rail protection board and shorting out the power. ""If you bridge the third rail, which has 600 volts of electricity, to the signal rail, which has 12 volts of electricity,"" Greenblatt said, ""it's going to blow things."" The Rail Control Center's chief officer, Paul McPhee, showed me a picture on his phone of the charred board, which looked as though it could have been pulled from the fire pit at a campsite. It took about two and a half hours for the temporary repairs to be completed and full power to be restored. The trains could now start running again but were required to move at reduced speeds in the vicinity of the station. ""We're operating in a degraded mode right now,"" Greenblatt said. Systemwide, the biggest source of subway delays is simple overcrowding. In the 1990s, after a derailment killed five passengers and a collision killed a train operator, the M.T.A. started actively slowing down its trains. This has reduced ""throughput"" — the number of trains that move through the system at any given time — which has increased crowding. And when the subway becomes more crowded, it grows slower still, with trains stuck in stations while knots of passengers fight their way in and out of cars. As ridership grew from 2012 to 2016, the end-to-end running time during peak hours on the numbered lines increased by more than six minutes. Average train speeds are now slower than they were in 1950. The subway could be both faster and safer if all of it were controlled by a computer-based signal system, which would automatically ensure that trains are always operating at the maximum safe speed, with the narrowest possible distance between them. Instead, much of the subway uses a signal system that dates to the 1920s and '30s. What that means didn't really hit home for me until I visited the signal-repair shop at the 215th Street rail yard in Manhattan. Technicians were hunched over cast-iron gadgets — stop motors, compressors, track relays — that looked as if they belonged in the workshop of an eccentric antique collector. In the machine shop downstairs, I saw workers making mounting brackets and ball bearings; even the system's most basic parts are so obsolete that they have to be manufactured in-house. ""A lot of the equipment we really can't purchase,"" the M.T.A.'s assistant chief of signals, Salvatore Ambrosino, told me as we watched a technician assemble a tiny motor. ""Our only option is to rebuild."" What would rebuilding the subway actually look like? Replacing the signal system is just one in a long list of needs, some of which were recently compiled by the Regional Plan Association, a civic group that has been studying New York infrastructure for decades. Most of the system's 472 stations need some kind of major repair or wholesale renovation. Elevators need to be added — fewer than one in five stations are even partially accessible to people with physical disabilities. Cracked tiles and rusty columns need to be replaced. Stairwells and entryways need to be enlarged, flood-prone openings need to be waterproofed, ventilation plants need to be rebuilt. All the platforms need to be sealed off from the tracks with automatic sliding doors to prevent passengers from throwing trash on the rail bed and block them from falling, jumping or being pushed under a train. Sharp turns in tunnels throughout the system need to be reconstructed so that they are less severe, allowing for higher speeds and thus more trains. The Regional Plan Association stopped there, but you could go further. The roadbed beneath much of the track needs to be chipped out and replaced with fresh concrete and new drains. About 3,000 of the system's 6,400 cars date to the 1960s, '70s and '80s. About half of those need to be rebuilt with modern motors, wheels and brakes, as well as open gangways between the cars to increase capacity. The other half need to be replaced altogether. In the meantime, Greenblatt and his staff take it day by day, managing incidents as though they are an inevitable force of nature. When I asked him about the so-called F-train meltdown that became a media sensation in June — hundreds of passengers were stuck in a tunnel for more than 40 minutes in a 40-year-old train that lost power — he told me he was surprised the incident received so much attention. When he left work that night, it had not felt any different from any other day on the job. And in a sense, it wasn't. The F-train meltdown was just one of the 8,122 incidents reported during the month of June. ""I don't know if I like the word 'meltdown' so much,"" Greenblatt said. ""Things happen."" It is Gov. Andrew Cuomo who, by a strange quirk of New York history, is ultimately responsible for the subway. As governor, he appoints the chairman of the M.T.A. — a sprawling government bureaucracy with 70,000-plus employees overseeing nine bridges and tunnels, two commuter railroads, the New York City bus system and the subway — as well as a plurality of its directors. More to the point, he effectively controls the state budget that funds the authority. It was Cuomo who pressed the M.T.A. to complete its endlessly delayed construction on the first phase of the Second Avenue subway — three new stations; two new miles of track — before the end of 2016 and who presided over its opening in January 2017 like a proud parent. In the months that followed, though, the subway's many underlying problems burst open like a broken water main, and angry riders made a point of affixing the hashtag #CuomosMTA to their proliferating complaints on social media. After initially trying to shift the blame to the city's mayor, Bill de Blasio, Cuomo has of late been trying to recast himself as the subway's can-do savior. He convened an advisory panel, called FixNYC, to study the idea of implementing a congestion-pricing plan to help subsidize mass transit. He created an open competition called the Genius Challenge: Come up with a viable plan to fix the subway and win $1 million. And on a rainy, wind-swept night in early September, his press office invited a small group of reporters and local camera crews to assemble in a soggy, grime-caked ventilation room beneath the Union Square station to watch him roll out his latest plan. Spotlights hung from rusty columns; a dozen or so chairs were arrayed before a lectern and a video monitor. A little before midnight, Cuomo made his dramatic entrance through a large vented manhole, climbing down a metal ladder in pressed chinos, tasseled boots and a windbreaker bearing the New York State seal, and announced that he was doubling the fine for littering in the subway to $100 and buying some new jumbo-size vacuum cleaners to clean the tracks. The moves were part of Cuomo's $836 million ""NYC Subway Action Plan,"" which was unveiled last summer by the newly installed M.T.A. chairman, Joe Lhota, who had also run the authority several years earlier. The matter of who is going to cover that $836 million remains a matter of some controversy. Cuomo offered to pay for half and said the city should cover the rest. De Blasio refused, noting that the city had already given the M.T.A., which it did not control, billions of dollars in taxes. The plan remains only partially funded. This is a familiar quandary for the subway. When the M.T.A. first took control of the system in 1968, the idea was to use toll money from bridges and tunnels to subsidize the subway, but this scheme supplied only a small part of what was needed. For years, the state and federal governments picked up the shortfall, but beginning in the 1990s, Gov. George Pataki and the Republican-controlled Congress refused to cover the M.T.A.'s rising costs. It has been scrambling for new streams of income ever since. Cuomo, for all his homilies about American greatness being the product of ""what we built,"" has also rejected some efforts to add new revenue sources to the subway. In 2015, a state assemblyman from Brooklyn, Jim Brennan, wrote a bill that would have steered a small but escalating percentage of state personal-income tax to the authority. Cuomo's staff dismissed the idea. ""They said the M.T.A. wouldn't be able to spend the money, the construction industry was already at capacity,"" Brennan told me. ""Of course, when I would talk to Tom Prendergast"" — the chairman of the M.T.A. at the time — ""and his top people, they would go: 'Yes, yes, we can spend the money! Give us the money!' "" In fact, the M.T.A. has often proved all too capable of spending money, with construction costs well beyond what other cities spend on similar projects. It's fair to blame the whole New York political establishment — Cuomo, de Blasio and their counterparts stretching back decades — for presiding over the subway's decline. But the real political problem is, at root, a structural one. The subway subsists on an ad hoc patchwork of taxes implemented and overseen by a governor who represents millions of voters well beyond the greater metropolitan area. Brennan estimates that New York City is responsible for 55 percent of the state's revenues, but that doesn't change a fundamental political reality for its governors: People who don't ride the subway don't want to pay for the subway. You might say the subway is a victim of the same rural-urban divide that has come to define American politics today. A more parochial version of this divide exists in the city itself, where representatives of car-centric outer-borough neighborhoods continue to fight congestion-pricing plans that could deliver hundreds of millions of dollars every year to the M.T.A. How much money does the subway really need? The Regional Plan Association has done some preliminary estimates based on the current cost of M.T.A. projects. They calculated that renovating the 30 stations most desperately in need would run $14 billion. Dealing with those sharp turns to increase speeds and capacity would cost $5 billion. Adding 61 track miles with new stations — mainly in neighborhoods without subway access and with large and generally low-income populations that are heavily dependent on mass transit — would run another $62 billion. Replacing the signal system would cost $27 billion. The group didn't look at replacing or overhauling cars, but a recent M.T.A. contract priced them at about $2 million each, so buying all of the new cars that are needed would cost nearly $3 billion. Just this partial list — I haven't included the platform doors, for instance — brings the total to about $111 billion. It's a big number. But not when you put it in context. New York City and its environs generated $1.7 trillion in gross metropolitan product in 2016. That's roughly 9 percent of the nation's overall G.D.P. How much of that activity is dependent on the subway? About a year before Hurricane Sandy, a state-funded group of scientists and engineers produced a comprehensive (and as it happens, prescient) report on the damage that a hundred-year storm surge could cause to the system. One of the study's authors, Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist at Columbia University, told me that losing the subway for a month would cost the city about $60 billion in lost economic output. The reality of this apocalyptic scenario hasn't sunk in. Absent sufficient resources, the subway has been left with diminished ambitions and empty spectacles. Inside the ventilation room at Union Square, Cuomo delivered some remarks about the scourge of garbage in the subway and then led the group out onto the waterlogged tracks. A few industrial-strength vacuum cleaners stood waiting. The governor posed for a picture with a Starbucks cup he had picked up off the rail bed and then took a turn on the hose of the 83-horsepower Vac-Tron, sucking up watery gunk that would no doubt be back with the next heavy rain. II. WHY WE MUST SAVE THE SUBWAY The subway has been saved before, and the man who saved it was Richard Ravitch. Stocky, white-haired and gruff, Ravitch, now 84, is the type of civic macher you don't see much anymore, an urban idealist who has spent his career moving back and forth between the public and private sectors. His grandfather fled the pogroms in Russia, and — classic New York story — created a successful construction business from nothing. He lost everything in the Depression, and then his son, Ravitch's father, made his name building apartment buildings on Central Park West. Ravitch followed his father into the real estate business. In the 1960s, he served on President Lyndon Johnson's National Commission on Urban Problems, and in 1973, after 12 years of trying, he completed Waterside, a $78 million, 1,470-unit development for low-and-middle-income families on the East River, just south of the United Nations. A couple of years later, Ravitch played a critical role in rescuing New York City from its fiscal crisis, helping to persuade the teachers' union to invest $150 million of its pension fund in a new series of city bonds. And in 1979, he was named chairman of the M.T.A. Ravitch didn't need the job or even really want it. He waived his salary and took to wearing a bulletproof vest in public after someone threatening to kill him shot an M.T.A. police officer at his office. But he was a child of the New Deal and a passionate believer in the subway, which at the time was in even worse shape than it is today. During the fiscal crisis, drastic funding cuts had spun the subway into a downward spiral of deteriorating tracks, malfunctioning cars, increasing crime and falling ridership, a steep decline that tracked the city's own postindustrial collapse. To reverse the trend, Ravitch prepared a detailed breakdown of the costs of repairing and replacing all of the system's outdated equipment and proposed a sweeping plan to help fund the work. He argued at the time: ""The transit situation, though lacking the drama of imminent bankruptcy, represents an equally grave threat to our economy, the social equilibrium and the survival of the greatest city in the world."" The subway's importance to the city begins with a single, durable economic principle: Cities create density, and density creates growth. Economists call the phenomenon agglomeration. Not only does geographical proximity reduce costs, but it also facilitates the exchange of knowledge and spurs innovation. It's a principle that holds true for better and worse and regardless of the industry. The free-market economist Edward Glaeser has pointed out that the junk bonds and leveraged buyouts of '70s and '80s Wall Street were as much the product of human collaboration as they were of corporate greed. The urban-planning professor Elizabeth Currid-Halkett coined the phrase ""the Warhol economy"" to describe how this same sort of cross-fertilization and idea-sharing works in New York's art, fashion and music worlds. As industries grow, they attract and create new, connected ones: Book publishers beget book agents, tech start-ups beget venture-capital firms and so on. It all begins with the ability to pack large numbers of people into small spaces and then unpack them at the end of the day. Without the subway, this process breaks down, and the city dissipates. Ravitch took his case to editorial boards and legislative leaders. But there was a problem. No one wanted new taxes. So Ravitch cold-called David Rockefeller, the longtime head of Chase Manhattan Bank. ""I said, 'Mr. Rockefeller, this is an audacious request, but would you get up at 5 in the morning and let me show you the subway system?' "" he told me one afternoon in his office at Waterside. ""And he said yes."" Ravitch then suggested that Rockefeller bring along the chairman of MetLife and the president of AT&T. All three went and saw the dirty, graffiti-scarred system firsthand. As Ravitch tells the story, that was all it took: Rockefeller called the majority leader of the State Senate and told him to ""give Ravitch what he needs."" The tax package passed, and Ravitch ultimately raised $7.7 billion — more than $17 billion in today's dollars — much of which was spent replacing cars, refurbishing stations and increasing maintenance. The turnaround was not immediate. A year after Ravitch's tax plan was enacted, annual subway ridership dropped below one billion. But before long, as the system gradually became safer, more reliable and less unsavory, it started to trend up. By 2015, ridership had hit 1.7 billion, a level not seen since the late 1940s. The rejuvenation of the subway has been intertwined with a protracted period of staggering economic prosperity — agglomeration at work. New York rebuilt the subway, and the subway rebuilt the city. It was one of the great urban renaissance stories of our modern era. But now that the city is thriving, it faces another challenge, perhaps an even greater one: how to spread this staggering wealth more evenly. The subway might again be a central part of the solution. If the story of the subway is the story of density, it is also the story of land — and more to the point, the story of land value. Before the first tracks had even been laid, real estate speculators were gobbling up farmland and empty lots along the proposed route and then quickly flipping their parcels at huge premiums to builders. When the subway recovered from its last major crisis, it again began throwing off enormous returns for the owners of the land above it. From 1993 to 2013, the average price for a co-op or condo in TriBeCa rose from $182 per square foot to $1,569. In the process, prime real estate in Manhattan was transformed from a place where people lived and built businesses into a high-yield investment in which absentee owners parked their money and watched it grow. As Manhattan's business-district centers became denser and its scarce real estate more expensive, the growth started to spill out, following the subway's snaking lines across the river, into Brooklyn and Queens. ""Developers build things where the subway works, and we build far fewer things where it doesn't,"" Jed Walentas, the 43-year-old principal of the real estate development company Two Trees Management, told me recently over lunch at a cafe in Dumbo, Brooklyn's answer to SoHo. ""We put density where there's transit."" Walentas, who was wearing the familiar Brooklyn uniform of jeans, New Balance sneakers and a blue hoodie, and his father, David, own a good chunk of Dumbo, an investment that has made them rich — house in the Hamptons, vacations heli-skiing — beyond the wildest dreams of most New Yorkers. I've known Walentas since the early 2000s, when I rented a desk in one of his many buildings in the neighborhood, a turn-of-the-century factory that has since been converted into multimillion-dollar condominiums. This is pretty representative of Dumbo's overall trajectory over the last two decades. It's a stark transformation that would have been impossible to predict when his father first started buying up the neighborhood's underutilized properties in the early 1980s, before it was widely known as Dumbo. What enabled it to happen wasn't just the neighborhood's excellent subway access — it's sandwiched between the F line and the A line — or the city's economic recovery, or even the exodus of rich people priced out of Manhattan by even richer people. The transformation of Dumbo required something much simpler: a change in the zoning law. For years, the neighborhood had been restricted to only manufacturing uses, a legacy of the city's losing battle to retain industrial jobs in the 1960s. In the late '90s, Walentas and his father were able to persuade the city to jettison these old rules and allow them to completely remake the neighborhood, filling old factories with loft apartments, design-and-tech-centric offices, retail stores, artists' studios and new condo towers. In the subsequent 20 years, as the neighborhood changed, average condo prices rose from $200 per square foot to more than $1,500. More recently, Walentas has pushed north into Williamsburg, leveraging similar rezonings there to turn a former textile factory into the trendy Wythe Hotel (near the L train) and a 19th-century Domino sugar refinery (J, M and Z) into three million square feet of office space, retail stores, parks and apartments. Like most good-government tools, zoning sounds boring, but it is in fact a secret means by which cities are shaped and fortunes are made. If the subway delivers density, zoning determines where that density goes by doing things like placing limits on how tall buildings can rise or how many dwellings they can contain. New York's zoning codes are byzantine, the product of years of pushing and pulling between the desire to allow the city to evolve and grow and the impulse to keep development in check. These codes have helped preserve the city's historic buildings and neighborhoods while preventing its streets from being forever cast into darkness by endless rows of skyscrapers. But they have also had the effect of restricting the supply of housing, which has driven up prices, especially in neighborhoods with desirable buildings and good subway access. ""I rent studio apartments for $3,400 a month,"" Walentas told me. ""It doesn't make any sense."" New York is facing an affordable-housing crisis. In response, the city is incentivizing developers to build below-market-rate housing with property-tax exemptions, while also adding regulations that require them to incorporate more affordable housing into their higher-end projects. But securing one of these affordable units is not easy. Of the roughly 2,300 apartments in Walentas's Domino project, about 700 will be reserved for lower-income tenants. The first 105 affordable units were recently made available at monthly rents ranging from $590 to $964; 87,000 people entered the lottery for them. Walentas is a developer. If you want housing to be more affordable, he says, build more houses. ""The way to put downward pressure on rents is not to have fear of making things better,"" he told me. ""It's to make things so pervasively better that people have more choices."" In his words, it's ""insane"" that so little of the wealth that the subway generates flows back into the system. In Hong Kong, the company that runs the subway also controls the property around it, earning huge amounts that it can then reinvest in service enhancements. The M.T.A., by contrast, is largely cut out of the land profiteering that it enables: Of the authority's roughly $16 billion budget in 2017, about $460 million came from a tax on residential real estate transactions. An additional $520 million came from a tax on commercial sales. To put those numbers in perspective, several years ago, a group of economists calculated that the land in New York City — just the land, not the buildings on it — was worth about $2.5 trillion. One thing New York City has plenty of is money, and much of it is bound up in real estate, a kind of blank canvas with unlimited economic promise. Toward the end of our lunch, I asked Walentas a hypothetical question: What if the M.T.A. could offer the real estate community development rights as a kind of bargaining chip? Would it underwrite subway upgrades and expansions into underserved areas in exchange? ""Oh, yeah,"" he said without hesitating. ""It's just math. You can make the money come right out of the air with a pencil."" The subway has made a lot of people very rich. And without carefully constructed zoning laws that foster inclusive growth, it can create the kind of gentrification that contributes to America's growing income divide. That divide has been especially acute in New York City. The Fiscal Policy Institute, an economic think tank, reports that between 1980 and 2015, the share of the country's income going to the wealthiest 1 percent increased from 10 percent to 22 percent. In New York City, it went from 12.2 percent to 40.9 percent. The subway can help narrow that divide by doing what subways do best: increasing density. For all the recent growth in neighborhoods like Dumbo and Williamsburg, large pockets of the city remain underpopulated and underdeveloped. Many of these neighborhoods already have good subway access. One of them is in a section of Brooklyn called East New York. East New York is predominantly black and Hispanic, with a small South Asian community. Its median household income is about $35,000, and some 35 percent of its 35,000 or so residents live below the federal poverty level. East New York was gradually hollowed out by the same cycle of disinvestment that ate away at a lot of formerly middle-class neighborhoods in New York and other American cities over the course of the 1960s and '70s. The city's manufacturing jobs had disappeared, and the white middle-class flight from the neighborhood was underway, helped along by avaricious real estate brokers who issued alarmist warnings about East New York's future. In the process, East New York became a victim of what economists call spatial, or geographic, inequality: As its population shrank and its demographics changed, stores closed and city services declined, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. And so for the most part it remained, until recently, when the gentrification that had been pushing east across Brooklyn along the L train began to creep into East New York. A neighborhood that had long been starved of resources was now in danger of being hit by a wave of development that could push out longtime residents. What was to be done? The answer will be a kind of grand experiment in urban planning, made possible, of course, by the subway. East New York was recently rezoned to invite both residential and commercial development to revive the neighborhood, but with a combination of regulations and incentives that will ensure that half of the nearly 6,000 units of new housing would be affordable. This time, as the subway draws new residents to a neighborhood, the city will take a stronger hand in shaping its demographics and trying to ensure that its existing population isn't priced out. The hope is that the whole neighborhood will become more dense, and the resulting prosperity will be widely shared. All with just the stroke of a pencil and the subway. The concept dates to Mayor Michael Bloomberg's era, when the Obama administration awarded New York a grant for cities looking to build more affordable housing near mass transit. De Blasio has now turned it into an early cornerstone of his promise to build or preserve 300,000 affordable apartments around the city. In addition to the subsidies it will provide to developers, the city has pledged to contribute $250 million to building schools, parks and a new community center in the neighborhood. ""This sort of targeted investment has never been done before in any community,"" the local City Council member, Rafael Espinal, told me as we toured the neighborhood on a recent afternoon. Espinal, the son of Dominican immigrants, grew up in the adjoining neighborhood of Cypress Hills and was an important advocate for the rezoning, over the objections of some who argued that the increased development would only accelerate gentrification in East New York. ""If we didn't move forward with this plan, the reality is that people here would have been displaced,"" he said as we passed the construction site for one of the neighborhood's first new developments, Chestnut Commons. It's a mixed-used development built around an apartment complex with 274 units of affordable housing; more than 80 units will be set aside for households earning up to $25,770, some of them specifically reserved for formerly homeless families. We ended up back at the Broadway Junction subway station, the inspiration for the rezoning plan and the home to five different lines and a stop on the Long Island Rail Road. Broadway Junction is dark, dingy and overcrowded. Some 100,000 people pass through this station every day, and yet the blocks surrounding it are largely barren. The rezoning plan envisions a rebuilt Broadway Junction as the commercial anchor for the whole project. It takes some imagination, but if you squint hard enough, you can see it: a brightly lit, newly renovated transit hub, providing the density needed for retail stores, office space and government and academic institutions, bringing new economic energy to the neighborhood and — while we're imagining things — a much better subway for the people who live in East New York. The revitalized blocks around Broadway Junction — desirable to people with more money, affordable to people with less — would reduce spatial inequality and provide current residents new jobs. And with a faster, more reliable subway, those same residents could also commute more quickly not just to Manhattan but to hospitals, nursing homes, health care clinics and community colleges in the outer boroughs, the source of a lot of the city's more recent job growth. In New York, transit dictates opportunities. The case for the subway is the case for mobility: physical mobility, economic mobility, social mobility. The business leaders, politicians and engineers who made the subway all those years ago understood that promise, and it remains the most profound message of the system even in its decline: The city can be built, and the people can come, and they can thrive — millions of them, then millions more. That revelation has sustained us for more than a century, and some among us still see within our broken subway the stubborn glimmers of genius. When Max Diamond was a preschooler in Park Slope in the late 1990s, he turned his wooden train set into an exact replica of his local line, complete with all four tracks and the accurate location of each switch. By the time he was 8, he could identify and describe in detail all the different types of cars in the subway system. By the time he was 11, he knew the track layout of the entire system, not just the different stops on the different lines, but the hundreds of places where the tracks connect and the precise locations of the multitude of switches and signals. In the eighth grade, he started his own YouTube channel, where his subway videos, which he posts under the handle Dj Hammers, made him something of a celebrity among subway buffs. In 2016, Diamond was hired by the M.T.A. as a paid intern, and at 21, he now crunches numbers in its performance-analysis unit while he works toward an economics degree at the City College of New York. We met one fall afternoon at the Fulton Street station in Manhattan, just a short walk from the M.T.A.'s headquarters, and boarded a Brooklyn-bound J train — an R42, he said, dating to 1969. We got on the first car, moving quickly to the large picture window at the front of the train, as has been Diamond's custom since he was a toddler, and wended our way through the tunnels beneath Lower Manhattan before emerging into the fading sunlight on the elevated tracks across the Williamsburg Bridge. Like most regular riders, I tend to think of the subway as a necessary evil, the least worst way to get where I'm going, which made it a little disorienting to spend time with someone who rides the subway for fun. But in its early years, hundreds of thousands of people did just that every Sunday. According to the historian Clifton Hood, it was called ""doing the subway."" Diamond calls it ""railfanning."" The subway is a very different sort of marvel today. What's miraculous at this point is that it still works at all. The fact that it does, that even after decades of neglect it is still somehow managing to carry New York's economy on its back, may be the best argument for giving it everything it needs, and then a whole lot more. And what is the alternative? Here's one possible scenario: New York won't die, but it will become a different place. It will happen slowly, almost imperceptibly, for years, obscured by the prosperity of the segment of the population that can consistently avoid mass transit. But gradually, an unpleasant and unreliable subway will have a cascading effect on New Yorkers' relationship with their city. Increasingly, we will retreat; the infinite possibilities of New York will shrink as the distances between neighborhoods seem to grow. In time, businesses will choose to move elsewhere, to cities where public transit is better and housing is cheaper. This will depress real estate values, which will make housing more affordable in the short term. But it will also slow growth and development, which will curtail job prospects and deplete New York's tax base, limiting its ability to provide for citizens who rely on its public institutions for opportunity. The gap between rich and poor will widen. As the city's density dissipates, so too will its economic energy. Innovation will happen elsewhere. New York City will be just some city. That doesn't have to happen. The subway still exists, and the people who operate it still bring a kind of subtle genius to their work. As we rode deeper into Brooklyn, Diamond told me about something he had seen the night before. He had been monitoring the Yankees' playoff game on the internet, not because he cares about baseball but because the heavy crowds during the postseason often spur rare service patterns. His instinct was right. ""Trains started at Yankee Stadium and went down the D line to 36th Street, then switched over to the N line to Coney Island, then continued through the Coney Island terminal, before switching to the Q line to Brighton Beach,"" Diamond told me. This sort of move wouldn't be possible in most other cities, where subway lines operate independently, but in New York they overlap and intersect, making a single, cohesive, interchangeable whole. ""It was actually pretty brilliant,"" he said in a reverent tone, as the blue sky in front of us began to darken."
News,2018-01-03,"Happy new year to you and yours, of course, but I’m going to have to put a halt to the festivities and play Frowning Farhad for a minute: You’re fooling yourself if you think 2018 is going to be any different, sanity- or anxiety-wise, from the roller coaster of the year just concluded.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/technology/2018-technology-chaos.html,1280," Happy new year to you and yours, of course, but I'm going to have to put a halt to the festivities and play Frowning Farhad for a minute: You're fooling yourself if you think 2018 is going to be any different, sanity- or anxiety-wise, from the roller coaster of the year just concluded. Sure, as in any year, a lot of good things could happen in 2018, and perhaps lots of bad things will happen, too. (How's that for a prediction?) But there is a deeper and more unsettling certainty about the ride upon which we've all just embarked: A lot of probably very crazy things will happen in 2018. Get ready for even more events that don't follow the rational course, and narratives that appear unmoored from the laws of politics, business and science. The background sensation of uncertainty that has pervaded much of the last two years isn't going to abate. Just the opposite — my columnist's Spidey sense tells me it's only going to get worse. Strap in. Just a few years ago, there was a dawning sense that technology would give us a peek around the corner. Thanks to reams of information — sensors and surveillance everywhere, and computing capacity to make sense of it all — it looked as if we were entering a ""Minority Report""-type world, where much of the future could be foretold in our numbers. Google could predict flu trends, election-stats nerds could predict political outcomes, and predictive policing algorithms were going to give us a handle on crime. Yet what has happened is rather quite different. Instead of revealing unseen order and predictability in the world, technology has unleashed a cascade of forces that have made the world more volatile — and thus made the future hazier and more open to out-of-the-blue results. Some of this isn't news. In 2016 and 2017, the world began to appreciate how smartphones and social networks can upend what we once considered the natural order. Tech has helped undercut the power of incumbent institutions — governments, political parties, the media, the patriarchy — and it has created a new class of geopolitical actors whose presence and ricocheting power we're all still getting used to: trolls, terrorists, conspiracy theorists, social-media activists, hackers and cyptocurrency bugs, among others. These dynamics aided many of the biggest and most surprising stories in the last couple of years — Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, the emergent resistance movement against him, the #MeToo avalanche, the decline of Uber, the rise of Bitcoin. Yet even as a barrage of surprising stories plays out, many of us have yet to come to grips with the permanence of this chaos. People seem to have a latent, hopeful sense that things are going to calm down, that we're on the cusp of a more normal news cycle. I suspect that's wrong. Chaos is the new normal; the apprehension you feel every time you get a notification on your phone — the fear that you don't know what fresh horror it could bring — isn't an overreaction but an adaptation. Thanks to phones and Facebook, anything really could happen tomorrow. ""I will tell you that as someone who does this professionally, my job has become a lot harder in the last few years,"" said Amy Webb, a futurist who runs the Future Today Institute, a firm that helps big companies think about the possibilities of tomorrow. ""There are just a lot more variables in play,"" Ms. Webb said. ""Think about how a single tweet from Donald Trump can have all these strange reverberations across the world. You can almost apply chaos theory to Donald Trump's Twitter account."" One of the touchstone ideas of chaos theory, which is the study of dynamic systems, is the ""butterfly effect"" — the idea that small changes in initial conditions can lead to huge differences in outcomes, like how a butterfly flapping its wings in Peru can cause a hurricane in Houston. Nowadays, because we're hyperconnected, we see butterfly effects everywhere. A single confessional blog post by Susan Fowler, a former employee of the ride-hailing company Uber, led to a swirling online campaign that eventually brought down Travis Kalanick, Uber's once indomitable chief executive — an outcome that, as far as I can tell, not a single observer of Uber predicted would happen long before it did. But it's not just that one-off stories cause huge cascades; it's that in a connected world, there are now so many one-off stories capable of setting off cascades, and no one knows which ones will hit. Note how Mr. Trump was not brought down by the series of sexual harassment claims against him during the presidential campaign — and yet just a few months later, claims against a host of other powerful men spiraled into a culture-shaping movement that has upended many parts of the economy. To continue the butterfly-effect analogy: ""It used to be that there were a trillion butterflies each in their own weather system, but we have now connected all those butterflies into one planetary weather system — and you never know which one is going to have some kind of autocatalytic effect, and which one isn't,"" said Alexander Rose, executive director of the Long Now Foundation, an organization that aims to promote a long-term outlook on the world. As if all that weren't enough, there's another complication to fold into the chaos: Technology isn't stopping. The pace of technological change is in many cases too fast for anyone of us to comprehend or get used to; as a result, just as the world seems to get its head around one new force unleashed by tech, another comes along to discombobulate our efforts to respond to it. For example, in the last year and a half, social networks have tried several ways to tamp down the misinformation flowing online. Their efforts have been fitful at best, but already they risk being outdated. Soon artificial intelligence and augmented reality software will make it trivially easy to create not just text-based misinformation but entirely fake audio and video, too. Last year, researchers at the University of Washington used A.I. to scan through footage of Barack Obama speaking, giving them a way to put just about any words into the former president's mouth. Someone else thought up a more vulgar way to show off similar tech — a fake pornographic video of the actress Gal Gadot. In the run-up to the 2018 election, Facebook, Twitter and other social networks have vowed to take on the kinds of misinformation and trolling that ran amok in 2016. But what if social media is hit with a wave of explosive, realistic-looking viral videos whose authenticity can't be confirmed? It's highly unlikely that the social networks, the news media or the political class will know how to respond to such a situation. Mr. Rose pointed out that in the long span of human history, periods of turbulence aren't unusual; technological change often prompts social and political instability and unpredictability. What is unusual now is that many of us aren't used to this sort of chaos. ""I'm 39, about to turn 40, and people like me who came of age in America in the '80s and '90s, we got used to a fairly predictable world,"" said Nate Silver, the founder of the data-news site FiveThirtyEight, whose uncannily accurate forecast of the 2012 presidential election while at The New York Times set off wide interest in data-based journalistic predictions. ""So I do think people are now realizing the world is less predictable than we thought it was,"" Mr. Silver said. ""But in some ways that's a return to normal."""
News,2018-01-03,SHANGHAI — One new drug promises to stop cancer from spreading to other organs. Another would treat blood cancer. A third would use the body’s immune system to kill tumors.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/business/china-drugs-health-care.html,1204," SHANGHAI — One new drug promises to stop cancer from spreading to other organs. Another would treat blood cancer. A third would use the body's immune system to kill tumors. All three show encouraging results, and need just one more step to be approved for use in the United States. The drugs have something else in common: They were created in China. For years, China's drug industry concentrated on replicating Western medicines. Getting new drugs approved was a frustrating and time-consuming process. Companies thought plowing millions of dollars into research and development was risky and stuck to safer revenue streams. The country is now pushing to play a bigger role in the global drug industry. Millions of people in China have cancer or diabetes, and the government has made pharmaceutical innovation a national priority. Officials have promised to speed up drug approvals, and to reverse a brain drain by luring scientists back home. The authorities are providing land, grants and tax breaks, and investing in research. The three new drugs will have to clear American regulatory hurdles. If they do, they can stand as proof of China's growing ability to produce cutting-edge treatments, part of a broader transformation of the country's economy as it moves into higher-value and increasingly complex sectors. China's drug development is in the earliest stages compared to the broader industry. Some experts say, however, that it is only a matter of time before China's medical companies stand alongside Big Pharma giants like Pfizer and AstraZeneca. ""It's not whether they are going to,"" said Jonathan Wang, senior managing director of OrbiMed Asia, a health care investment fund. ""They are going to."" For now, access to quality drugs remains a problem in China. Many people buy medicines from Hong Kong and Macau — territories governed by separate laws. Online forums are devoted to discussing smuggling generics from India. Others buy the raw ingredients to make the drugs at home. Those who can afford it fly to the United States. A growing number of companies are trying to address that shortfall. Hutchison China MediTech, a firm backed by Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, started out in 2000 trying to develop the herbal drugs used in traditional Chinese medicine. In 2005, the company, known as Chi-Med, started developing cancer drugs. At its main laboratory in Shanghai, upward of 350 scientists are surrounded by rodents in testing rooms. More than half the scientists are at work trying to discover new drugs. In October, Chi-Med reported that more than 60 percent of patients in second-stage clinical trials had responded positively to its drug, savolitinib, which it is developing together with AstraZeneca. Savolitinib — the first drug of its kind — can be used to treat lung, kidney, gastric and colorectal cancers; it is often used in combination with other AstraZeneca drugs to shut down pathways that allow the cancer to spread. Chi-Med is awaiting more data. But if further tests get positive results, the company will apply for what is known as breakthrough therapy designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration. It still needs to run Phase 3 trials, the last step before seeking full approval from the F.D.A., but breakthrough therapy status would allow the final stage to be sped up. The trials involve drugs being tested, often against placebos, for their safety and effectiveness on as many as several thousand patients. Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research, said that based on the industry average, the probability of success in Phase 3 trials is 60 to 70 percent. If all goes according to plan, regulatory approval could come in late 2019, at the earliest, said Christian Hogg, Chi-Med's chief executive. ""It takes 20 years to get an overnight success, and that's where we are at the moment,"" he said. The last time China produced a new drug for the global pharmaceutical industry was in the 1970s, when the Chinese scientist Tu Youyou was credited with the discovery of artemisinin after Mao Zedong asked her to come up with a cure for malaria. But global recognition did not come until much later, after the Swiss drug maker Novartis bought the Chinese patent and started producing it in the late 1990s. Ms. Tu was eventually awarded a Nobel Prize in 2015. That is changing. Along with Chi-Med, another company, BeiGene, is already in Phase 3 trials globally for a drug used to treat a variety of lymphomas, the most common form of blood cancer, and an immunotherapy drug that aims to destroy tumors. It has also teamed up with Celgene and Merck to develop cancer drugs. Ms. Carney said she expected 20 or 30 Chinese-made drugs to seek Phase 3 trials in the United States, the world's biggest market for cancer drugs, within the next five years. Those that make it through will very likely be cheaper than those made by foreign companies, she said, based on current pricing patterns in China. Meanwhile, Big Pharma is shrugging off its long-held fears of China's rampant counterfeiting and cumbersome bureaucracy and setting up its own labs here. Johnson & Johnson, Novartis and Sanofi have all opened research centers in Shanghai to create drugs for Chinese patients. Executives say that the government has made inroads in toughening protections of pharmaceutical patents. And the pace of approvals has also quickened. In worst-case scenarios, drug companies needed to wait up to two years to get permission just to start clinical trials, which would then take several more years. The comparable waiting period in the United States is typically 30 days. Under Bi Jingquan, who was appointed the head of China's Food and Drug Administration in 2015, the agency has begun cracking down on companies making low-quality drugs and agreed to accept foreign data for clinical trials. Now, thanks to those shifts, as well as incentives offered by the government, scientists trained overseas are returning to China. After 20 years in the United States with Eli Lilly and Pfizer, Joan Shen moved to Shanghai in 2011 to lead clinical trials for Pfizer. She now heads research and development for a Chinese biotech firm, I-Mab Biopharma. The local government has helped secure funding for the company, and provided laboratory space in a high-tech business park. ""The funds are chasing us,"" she said, comparing the investment environment between China and the United States, ""instead of us having to spend numerous hours convincing investors."" Despite the optimism, Chinese pharmaceutical companies that want to go abroad still face obstacles. Competition among drugmakers in major markets like the United States is intense, and Chinese companies are hamstrung in particular by a lack of money committed to research. Jiangsu Hengrui, a Chinese company that has been moving toward developing new drugs from making generic ones, has the largest research budget of all Chinese drug firms. But its $180 million annual outlay pales in comparison with the $7.8 billion that Pfizer spent in 2016. Still, with several drugs in early-stage testing, it is targeting what Zhang Lianshan, the company's head of research and development, described as its ""ultimate goal"": regulatory approval in the United States. ""If you have a drug approved by the U.S. F.D.A.,"" Mr. Zhang said, ""that's a true demonstration of innovation."""
News,2018-01-03,"HONG KONG — President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, traded threats this week about the size, location and potency of their “nuclear buttons.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/asia/nuclear-button-trump-north-korea.html,812," HONG KONG — President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, traded threats this week about the size, location and potency of their ""nuclear buttons."" The image of a leader with a finger on a button — a trigger capable of launching a world-ending strike — has for decades symbolized the speed with which a nuclear weapon could be launched, and the unchecked power of the person doing the pushing. There is only one problem: There is no button. William Safire, the former New York Times columnist and presidential speechwriter, tracked the origin of the phrase ""finger on the button"" to panic buttons found in World War II-era bombers. A pilot could ring a bell to signal that other crew members should jump from the plane because it had been damaged extensively. But the buttons were often triggered prematurely or unnecessarily by jittery pilots. The expression is commonly used to mean ""ready to launch an atomic war,"" but the writer added in ""Safire's Political Dictionary"" that it is also a ""scare phrase used in attacking candidates"" during presidential elections. President Lyndon B. Johnson told Barry M. Goldwater, his Republican opponent in 1964, that a leader must ""do anything that is honorable to avoid pulling that trigger, mashing that button that will blow up the world."" Richard M. Nixon told advisers during the Vietnam War that he wanted the North Vietnamese to believe he was an unpredictable ""madman"" who could not be restrained ""when he's angry, and he has his hand on the nuclear button."" During the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton said of her opponent, ""Trump shouldn't have his finger on the button, or his hands on our economy."" Each nuclear-capable country has its own system for launching a strike, but most rely on the head of government first confirming his or her identity and then authorizing an attack. Despite Mr. Trump's tweet that he has a ""much bigger & more powerful"" button than Mr. Kim, the fact is, there is no button. There is, however, a football. Except the football is actually a briefcase. The 45-pound briefcase, known as the nuclear football, accompanies the president wherever he goes. It is carried at all times by one of five military aides, representing each branch of the United States armed forces. Inside the case is an instructional guide to carrying out a strike, including a list of locations that can be targeted by the more than 1,000 nuclear weapons that make up the American arsenal. The case also includes a radio transceiver and code authenticators. To authorize the attack, the president must first verify his identity by providing a code he is supposed to carry on him at all times. The code, often described as a card, is nicknamed ""the biscuit."" In his 2010 autobiography, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the final years of Bill Clinton's presidency, wrote that Mr. Clinton had lost the biscuit for several months without informing anyone. ""That's a big deal,"" General Shelton wrote, ""a gargantuan deal."" The president does not need approval from anyone else, including Congress or the military, to authorize a strike — a decision that might have to be made at a moment's notice. Nevertheless, some politicians have called for more layers of approval. ""The longer I'm in the Senate, the more I fear for a major error that somebody makes,"" Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said in 2016. ""One man, the president, is responsible. He makes an error and, who knows, it's Armageddon."" Much of North Korea's nuclear program is shrouded in mystery. Mr. Kim, however, is the undisputed ruler of his isolated country. Any decision to initiate an attack would most likely be his alone. In recent months, Mr. Kim has threatened to ignite an ""enveloping fire"" of missiles near the Pacific island of Guam, an American territory, and has warned that North Korean intercontinental ballistic missiles are capable of reaching the mainland United States. ""It's not a mere threat but a reality that I have a nuclear button on the desk in my office,"" Mr. Kim said in a speech on Monday. ""All of the mainland United States is within the range of our nuclear strike."" It is doubtful that there really is a button on his desk. Furthermore, an intercontinental attack from the North probably could not happen in minutes, let alone seconds. The North's longest-range missiles are believed to be powered by liquid rocket fuel. That means the missiles cannot be stored and ready-to-fire at a moment's notice. They must be loaded with fuel before launch, a process than can take hours. Newer, shorter-range missiles, are loaded with solid fuel, however, making them easier to launch before the North's enemies detect an attack."
News,2018-01-03,Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/business/dealbook/ant-financial-moneygram-trump.html,3192," Good Wednesday. Here's what we're watching: • Tesla pushes back its Model 3 production targets again. • Manafort's lawsuit faces a tough road. • Researchers discover two major flaws in the world's computers. • Spotify filed confidentially to go public. • The death of Ant Financial's bid to buy MoneyGram raises questions about how useful close ties to President Trump are. • Dominion Energy and Scana are combining. • Underwriting for free. Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. The electric carmaker said it delivered 1,550 Model 3s in the fourth quarter and would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter. Those numbers were well below analyst expectations and Tesla's past forecasts. In September, analysts predicted that Telsa would deliver 15,900 Model 3s in the fourth quarter. That number had come down since then. Prior to Wednesday's announcement, the consensus among analysts was 4,100, or more than double what Tesla actually delivered. Meanwhile, the forecast of 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter is half the number it had earlier promised. The company now says it will produce 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of the second quarter. Critics corner: ""The premise of the stock's sky-high valuation has long been of Tesla eventually dominating the auto industry. That notion has hardly ever seemed more fanciful,"" writes Heard on the Street's Charley Grant. The news hasn't spooked investors much. Shares are down just 2 percent after the close. Lawyers know that there are many paths to getting a good result. When one is blocked, then look for another one. The lawsuit filed by Paul J. Manafort Jr., the former campaign chairman for President Trump, against the Justice Department, deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein, and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is an effort to find a backdoor way to block the criminal charges filed against him last October. The Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear, most recently in 2014 in Kaley v. United States, that defendants cannot attack a grand jury indictment by claiming that they are innocent. That's what a trial is for, so once indicted the only alternative is to go to trial. But that's a risky path, especially for Mr. Manafort who will face a jury from Washington, D.C., a venue that is not very hospitable to Republicans. To avoid a trial, Mr. Manafort asked the court to stop the case because it is unrelated to any Russian interference with the 2016 election. The lawsuit claims that Mr. Mueller exceeded the limits of his appointment as special counsel, comparing the indictment to the discredited independent counsel law that led to drawn out investigations of President Bill Clinton and others in the 1990s. Can it work? Federal judges have a strong aversion to interfering with prosecutors, routinely refusing to second guess decisions about who to prosecute and what to charge. So Mr. Manafort faces a tough road if he wants to find a means to block Mr. Mueller from dragging him into court. Deciding whether one is guilty is usually left to the jury, not a judge saying who should and shouldn't be prosecuted. — Peter J. Henning Those are the names of two major security flaws found in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world's computers. The Meltdown flaw affects virtually every Intel microprocessor, which are used in more than 90 percent of computer servers. Spectre affects most other processors now in use, though the researchers believe this flaw is more difficult to exploit. From Cade Metz and Nicole Perloth of the NYT: ""The two problems could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of a computer. There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent — an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services."" The business implications are unclear for chip makers, who may have to eventually swap out all affected hardware to eradicate the threats. The researchers notified the affected companies but had tried to keep the news from the public so hackers could not take advantage of the flaws before they were fixed. The Register, a British science and technology website, reported news of the Meltdown flaw, spurring the researchers to release papers describing the flaws much earlier than they had planned. Intel's shares fell 3.4 percent Wednesday. Rivals Advance Micro Devices and Nvidia jumped 5.2 percent and 6.6 percent respectively. The tax overhaul signed into law last month should boost corporate bottom lines. The bad news? The gains could be shortlived. Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its 2018 earnings forecast for the Standard & Poor's 500 index to $153 from $139. ""The biggest impact on earnings from tax reform comes from the lowering of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, making up roughly $10 of the $14 increase. Buybacks representanother $3 of the increase, with some modest offsets from the minimum foreign tax rate and the cap on interest deductions."" But tax reform may weigh on corporate profits in 2019.The bank forecasts earnings of $161 in 2019. ""While tax reform should provide a big boost to 2018 earnings growth, there are several reasons to expect it to be a headwind to growth in subsequent years. First, economic theory suggests that higher returns should incentivize additional competition, which should have a negative impact on margins over time, especially with many traditional industries already facing increasing disruption. Second, stronger growth could result in more aggressive Fed tightening, which could eventually weigh on overall economic growth."" Which sectors stand to get biggest earnings boost this year from the cut to the corporate tax rate? consumer discretionary and telecom. Why? The two sectors generate more of their revenue domestically and have a higher average tax rate. Not Spotify it seems. The music streaming service filed confidentially to go public through a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, according to reports. The NYT reported in May that the company was leaning toward such a listing. A direct listing is exceedingly rare and bypasses the traditional initial public offering process that virtually every other company uses to begin trading on the markets. Direct listings essentially move trading in a company's stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing. By eschewing an I.P.O., Spotify is not seeking to raise additional money. Wall Street and Silicon Valley will watch Spotify's listing closely. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. Wall Street is unlikely to cheer such a development. Direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O. That's essentially what is happening in Asia. The Wall Street Journal reports that three state-owned Indian companies paid a dollar in underwriting fees to seven banks, including Barclays and Standard Chartered, for their work selling a total of $1.3 billion in dollar-denominated bonds. While those fees may be unusually low, they highlight a trend in the region: ""Underwriting revenue, while also up from a year ago, isn't keeping up with the accelerating pace of Asian corporate bond issuance. That is raising concerns that underwriting ""could become largely unprofitable"" in Asia. In the United States, companies, on average, pay fees of 0.7 percentage point for an investment-grade corporate bond issue and 1.2 percentage points for underwriting a junk bond offering.  So much for the charm offensive last year by Jack Ma: U.S. officials have effectively killed a $1.2 billion takeover bid by one of his companies for MoneyGram. The failure of Ant Financial, an electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, to win approval from an American national security watchdog raises questions of how much being friendly to President Trump ultimately helps. If it's true that White House officials are clashing over how hard a negotiating stance to take with countries like China over trade, this development suggests that the hawks might have the upper hand right now. Who should be worried • Foreign companies, particularly Chinese ones, seeking to buy American counterparts. (Think also of Broadcom, which is legally headquartered in Singapore and which is pursuing Qualcomm — and has assiduously courted Mr. Trump.) • Domestic companies looking to merge in contested situations, despite having unofficial support from the president. (Think Disney and Fox, whose proposed transaction raised antitrust concerns but garnered praise from Mr. Trump.) • American companies looking to do business in China, who may now face retaliatory blowback. Critics' corner • Lex writes, ""With the demise of this payments merger, any Chinese company wanting to buy anything of significance in the U.S. should give up."" (Lex) • Richard Beales writes, ""If it's a rebuke, it's one that's conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment."" (Breakingviews) Dominion Energy has agreed to buy Scana Corporation in an all-stock deal valued at $14.6 billion, including debt. Scana shareholders will receive 0.669 shares of Dominion Energy for each share held. That's about $53.71 a share based on Dominion's stock price at Tuesday's close and a 28 percent premium. Shares of Scana jumped 22 percent on the news, while Dominion slipped 4 percent. Scana has struggled since this summer when it abandoned two unfinished nuclear reactors in South Carolina. The project was once expected to showcase advanced nuclear technology but was plagued by delays and cost overruns. Scana's shares are down more than 40 percent since midsummer. Height Securities via Axios warns that the deal has ways to go before it closes. ""In this case especially, Dominion will have to pull out all the stops to demonstrate that their offer is the best deal for customers, particularly given the uncertainty facing [SCANA's] rates over the coming months. We're looking for a reaction from the Governor as well as House Speaker Jay Lucas and the PSC commissioners for early signs of whether Dominion's proposal will fall flat."" Where Bitcoin traded early yesterday: $13,833 Where Bitcoin is trading this morning: $15,202 What happened: It was probably the revelation that the venture capitalist Peter Thiel has made a big bet on the digital currency. From Rob Copeland of the WSJ: Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm's most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments. Has Founders Fund made money? The WSJ reports, citing unidentified sources, that the firm bought about $15 million in Bitcoin and that its stake is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Bitcoin flyaround • John O'Rourke, the head of Riot Blockchain, a small biotech-turned-digital currency company, has made at least $712,000 on price increase of more than 60 percent after the company added blockchain to its name.

(Bloomberg) It isn't just the fact that Mitt Romney, a sometimes vociferous critic of the president, is expected to run for Mr. Hatch's Senate seat. It's that another Republican lawmaker who has been relatively friendly to Mr. Trump is stepping down before the 2018 midterm elections — which could whittle down the G.O.P.'s control of Congress. More from Jonathan Martin of the NYT: Mr. Romney's potential ascent is particularly alarming to the White House because the former presidential candidate has an extensive political network and could use the Senate seat as a platform to again seek the nomination. Even if he were not to run again for president, a Senator Romney could prove a pivotal swing vote, impervious to the entreaties of a president he has scorned and able to rally other Trump skeptics in the chamber. He's running, probably: While Mr. Romney didn't issue a statement on his potential candidacy, he did change his location on Twitter from ""Massachusetts"" to ""Holladay, Utah."" Also worth noting The Washington flyaround • Republican and Democratic lawmakers will meet today with White House officials to try and reach a spending deal before Jan. 19 — or face a government shutdown.

(NYT) Oil is at its highest level since 2015, edging up this morning toward $67 a barrel. Geopolitical risks, like protests in Iran, have prompted buying, while production curbs by OPEC members have tightened supply. That rise is expected to continue. More from David Sheppard of the FT: While global oil demand is forecast to rise by about 1.4m barrels a day next year, growing US shale output combined with new projects in Brazil and Canada are broadly expected to see non-OPEC supply rise by a similar amount. Hedge funds are, however, betting that prices are likely to head higher, with some arguing that geopolitical unrest — including in OPEC member Venezuela, where oil output has been falling — should keep prices well supported. Blackstone's Byron Wien reckons that ""populism, tribalism and anarchy"" could push oil above $80 a barrel this year. The hedge fund's latest victory: Alexion Pharmaceuticals said that it would work with the activist investor on finding a new director for its board. From a statement by David Brennan, Alexion's chairman: We have been actively working to expand and diversify our board, and we welcome input from Elliott to identify a strong director candidate to further strengthen Alexion's board. The context: Michael broke the news last month that Elliott had built up a stake in the drug maker and was weighing a proxy fight if the company didn't change elements of its business strategy. The broader landscape: For companies under pressure from activists, resistance requires deft maneuvering, according to Breakingviews. Procter & Gamble's expensive, hard-line defense against Nelson Peltz failed, but both G.M. and Automatic Data Processing have shown that fending off hedge funds is possible.

Op-Ed,2018-01-03,This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/opinion/crime-decline-stop-and-frisk.html,660," This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. The reason for the plummeting of crime over the past three decades remains mostly a mystery. The national murder rate, for example, is about half what it was in 1990, and most of the theories explaining the decline are somewhere between incomplete and unpersuasive. One of those theories has long been known as ""broken windows"" — the idea that by cracking down on minor forms of disorder, the police prevent worse behavior. Over the last several years, New York City has conducted a natural experiment on a central tactic of the broken-windows strategy: stop-and-frisk. In 2011, New York's police department conducted more than 685,000 stop-and-frisks — or nearly 2,000 a day — of people whom officers deemed suspicious. But the combination of a court order and the election of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who campaigned against the practice in 2013, have largely ended it. During that 2013 campaign, the writer Kyle Smith — making an argument that was then widespread among conservatives — blasted de Blasio and the voters supporting him. ""New Yorkers have evidently decided that the crime wave is over and it's time to get lax about mayhem and disorder,"" Smith wrote for Forbes. As you probably know by now, I'm a fan of journalistic self-criticism, and Smith has engaged in some of it this week. His piece for National Review is called simply, ""We Were Wrong About Stop-and-Frisk."" He notes that crime has continued to decline under de Blasio. ""To compare today's crime rate to even that of ten years ago is to observe a breathtaking decline,"" Smith adds. The vast majority of stop-and-frisks did little to reduce crime, it seems. They instead amounted to harassment of innocent New Yorkers, many of whom were African-American men. (This six-minute Op-Docs film, by Julie Dressner and Edwin Martinez, puts a human face on the toll. It focuses on a Brooklyn teenager named Tyquan who was stopped about once every month, for years.) The demise of stop-and-frisk is worth celebrating. Its costs were clearly high, and its benefits now appear to have been tiny. But the larger mystery remains: What does explain a decline in crime that has improved life in almost every major city over the last few decades — and which almost nobody saw coming? Related: If you still think there is an easy answer, read Matt Ford's various debunkings in The Atlantic. And Jarvis DeBerry of The Times-Picayune argues that Senator John Neely Kennedy of Louisiana should now stop advocating stop-and-frisk as the answer to New Orleans's crime problems. Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post notes that Kennedy isn't the only person still peddling stop-and-frisk. Trump helping China, continued. From yesterday's print edition of The Wall Street Journal: ""Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in an interview France was looking to China and Russia to act as a counterweight to increasingly uncertain trade relations with the U.S. and Britain."" (If you missed yesterday's newsletter, it went into more detail on Trump's gifts to China.) It's not just China. Susan Glasser argues in Politico that the president's ignorance and volatility have already had real-world consequences for American national security and global leadership. ""When it comes to Trump and the world,"" she writes, ""it's not better than you think. It's worse."" On the positive side of foreign policy, Roger Cohen says Trump's response to the Iran protests has been largely right. Handouts. The historian Paul Sabin makes a good point about  the recent Times op-ed calling for an end to many online retailers avoiding sales taxes. They are effectively enjoying a government subsidy that brick-and-mortar stores do not receive. Sabin compares this subsidy to the de facto government handouts that car companies have long enjoyed (and that other forms of transportation have not). To say that online retailers are merely outcompeting traditional stores, Sabin suggests, is wrong."
News,2018-01-03,WASHINGTON — President Trump kicked off the new year with more than a dozen Twitter posts castigating his enemies and political foes and complimenting himself.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-tweets-nuclear-button.html,1269," WASHINGTON — President Trump kicked off the new year with more than a dozen Twitter posts castigating his enemies and political foes and complimenting himself. Seventeen times on his first work day of the new year in Washington, the president thumbed his thumbs at convention. The objects of his attention had a vast and seemingly disconnected range, from taunting Kim Jong-un about his nuclear prowess to flaunting his own successes. But there was more. He made an only-in-the-Trump-era kind of news by announcing a reality-style creation unique in presidential history: awards for the ""most dishonest & corrupt media."" He also threw in a couple of posts that were utterly bland in comparison, good wishes to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Republican from Utah who announced his retirement, and a pledge of support for the nation's veterans. He also showed a fixated consistency by again railing against ""crooked"" Hillary Clinton and her aide, Huma Abedin. If there was a strategy to his post-vacation social media burst, it was not readily apparent. Mr. Trump started his first workday back in Washington after vacationing at his resort in Florida with one of his favorite — and debunked — attacks on the Obama administration: that former President Barack Obama gave Iranians money that helped finance terrorism. In two weeks, Mr. Trump will face deadlines on whether to reinstate American sanctions that the Obama administration lifted as part of a nuclear deal. However, there is currently political unrest in Iran, and analysts worry that if Mr. Trump pulls out of the deal, Iranians could shift blame from the regime to the United States. Less than 48 hours into the new year, Mr. Trump called his one-time political opponent, Hillary Clinton, ""Crooked Hillary"" and said his own Justice Department was a shadowy deep state. Almost 14 months after the election, Mr. Trump has kept up a regular drumbeat of attacks on Mrs. Clinton. His criticism of the Justice Department suggests his attacks on his own attorney general will continue in 2018. Then, Mr. Trump praised the National Border Patrol Council for praising his administration. The Border Patrol Council, a union representing about 18,000 agents and agency employees, has long supported the president and his pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. The union endorsed him during the election. Shortly before Mr. Trump cinched the Republican nomination, he was interviewed on the union's podcast and said, ""I have you 100 percent in my mind and I have your back, believe me."" The president patted himself on the back for the passage of the tax legislation that he said has led to bonuses for workers around Christmas. Companies such as AT&T and Comcast announced plans to give workers bonuses tied directly to the changes in tax law. Some companies may be trying to get on his good side. For instance, AT&T is locked in an antitrust fight with Mr. Trump's Justice Department over its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. Mr. Trump offered tepid support for a diplomatic solution with the North Korea, citing a peace overture between the North and South. Mr. Trump took this opportunity to revive his derisive nickname for North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, ""Rocket man."" Stay tuned: Ten hours later, Mr. Trump raises the stakes and threatens the nuclear option. Taking credit for the friendly skies would be an improbable feat for the president whose proposed policy change for air traffic control is currently stalled in Congress. Mr. Trump has painted the same brush strokes repeatedly in his first year in office, casting the news media as a villainous force unwilling to recognize his accomplishments. He has frequently targeted The New York Times and has bestowed a Trumpian nickname of ""the failing New York Times"" for effect. Just 33 hours in the new year, he delivered a push me-pull you message to The Times's new publisher, A.G. Sulzberger. Mr. Trump incorrectly characterized the paper as failing financially, then offered a form of congratulations to Mr. Sulzberger, followed by another appeal to be treated better. He also incorrectly stated that The Times had issued an apology for its coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign. The president then blamed Democrats for inaction to protect undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, a cohort referred to ""Dreamers."" Mr. Trump has wavered on whether he would work with Democrats to strike a deal on the program, an Obama-era holdover known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. He essentially extended the program by calling an end to it in September and giving Congress six months to come up with a permanent solution. The topic is expected to come up during a meeting between the president and congressional Republicans on Wednesday. Mr. Trump reminded the country about how he has already helped veterans, including signing a bill that makes it easier for the Department of Veterans Affairs to remove bad employees. Mr. Trump posted a video compilation of him signing veterans-related legislation and speaking with veterans. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Senate Republican, announced Tuesday he would retire at the end of the year. Mr. Trump had urged Mr. Hatch, 83, to seek an eighth term. The vacancy opens the door to Mitt Romney, a frequent Trump critic with an extensive network, to occupy a potential swing vote in the Senate. The Trump administration has been frustrated with what it sees as a lack of support from Pakistan in rooting out terrorists — most recently with Islamabad's refusal to give Americans access to a captured militant who could provide intelligence on at least one American hostage. The United States is withholding $255 million in aid until Pakistan does more to combat terrorism. In a stark contrast to language the president used in a Twitter post on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump's threat of nuclear war with North Korea spooked some lawmakers, diplomats and national security experts, but also elicited their scorn for its juvenile and frightening tone. The wording was reminiscent of a boast he made during the presidential campaign that his hands, and by extension his genitals, were big enough. Mr. Trump signaled that he will continue his habit of labeling news networks as ""fake"" and ""dishonest"" when he or his administration receives unfavorable coverage. These promised awards make good on a vision the president, a former reality television star, articulated in late November when he suggested there be such a contest. Watch @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 2, 2018 Sean Hannity opened his 9 p.m. show on Fox with five minutes of praise for the president. ""Despite vicious media attack and many political obstacles, 2017 was a very successful first year for President Trump."" Under the headline ""Trump's Accomplishments,"" Mr. Hannity discussed the rising economy, homeownership rates and the fight against the Islamic State. With less regulation and the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, he said, ""you have a recipe for a Reagan-style economic explosion."" Mr. Trump later deleted this tweet. As the news media and the national security establishment scrambled to cover Mr. Trump's late-night threat of nuclear war with North Korea, the president ended his day — one with no public events — with a final Twitter post praising his first year successes."
News,2018-01-03,"MUMBAI, India — Mumbai, India’s bustling commercial hub, came to a standstill on Wednesday as protesters called for a general strike and thousands took to the streets.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/asia/india-protests-mumbai-dalits.html,862," MUMBAI, India — Mumbai, India's bustling commercial hub, came to a standstill on Wednesday as protesters called for a general strike and thousands took to the streets. The catalyst for the strike was violence against members of the lower-caste Dalits, or so-called untouchables, that occurred when several hundred thousand gathered on New Year's Day at a monument southeast of Mumbai to commemorate the victory 200 years ago of a British-led force against high-caste Hindus. But as marchers blocked train tracks and highways, they also expressed deeper frustrations with both of India's major political parties, which they accuse of failing to improve the lot of the hundreds of millions of Indians who have traditionally been stuck at the bottom of the country's economic and social hierarchy. ""We are here to demand justice,"" said Jitender Nikalje, a Dalit protester. On Wednesday, both houses of Parliament were repeatedly adjourned in response to the protests. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition Congress party, wrote on Twitter that the attacks by far-right Hindus were part of a ""fascist vision"" by India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., which has ties to Hindu nationalist groups, to keep Dalits ""at the bottom of Indian society."" In the Goregaon neighborhood of Mumbai, a Dalit stronghold, nearly 1,000 people marched down closed streets on Wednesday, shouting chants denouncing both the B.J.P. and the Congress party, which ran India for most of the period since independence from Britain. ""India has been the same for 2,000 years,"" said Shobhit Ambavade, who brought his twin 11-year-old sons to the march. ""People are still dominated and humiliated by the upper castes."" Mr. Ambavade, whose aunt and uncle were at the giant event on Monday, near the city of Pune in the western state of Maharashtra, said he and other protesters believed far-right Hindu groups affiliated with the B.J.P. had planned and carried out attacks there that left one man dead and several people injured. But he said both parties had failed to help low-caste Indians and others on the fringes of society. ""Congress is slow poison,"" he said. ""B.J.P. is instant."" By shutting down Mumbai for a day, he and other protesters hoped to prompt swift arrests of the Pune assailants and to draw India's attention to those left behind despite India's booming economy. That message was similar to the one sent by Dalits and other marginalized groups in state elections last month in Gujarat, where the B.J.P., led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is from Gujarat, suffered some erosion of its governing majority. Every year, thousands of Indians assemble near Pune to commemorate the Battle of Koregaon, when Dalits were hired by the British Army to defeat upper-caste Hindu rulers 200 years ago. The 1818 battle is seen as a point of community pride for Dalits, who are at the bottom of India's stratified caste system and have long been subjected to discrimination. But the celebrations turned sour this year, with scuffles breaking out on Monday and Tuesday between Dalits and far-right Hindu protesters, who started pelting stones at people leaving the event. The unrest in Pune fanned out to Mumbai, about 75 miles northwest, where schools, trains and businesses shut down on Wednesday. Dalit protesters, reacting to the violence near Pune, blocked traffic, hurled stones at buses and deflated tires in some areas of the city. In the cosmopolitan Pali Hill area of Mumbai, only pharmacies were open on Wednesday, having received special permission from protest organizers. Fruit and vegetable sellers, who usually do brisk business during the day, covered their wares with burlap bags, keeping a watchful eye for protesters. In 1818, members of the Mahar community, who are Dalits, were recruited by the British East India Company to fight in the Battle of Koregaon, when a small group of army men apparently defeated thousands of Peshwas, high-caste Hindus. For generations, Peshwa rulers had imposed horrific conditions on Dalits, who were considered so unclean that they were forced to wear pots around their necks so that their spit would not touch the ground. According to news reports, the Akhil Bhartiya Brahman Mahasangh, a group of upper-caste Brahmins, had urged the police in Pune to halt a seminar involving Dalit and leftist leaders a day before the commemoration on Monday, saying it would ""spread casteism."" Vishwajeet Deshpande, who leads Akhil Bhartiya Brahman Mahasangh in Maharashtra State, said by telephone on Wednesday that his group had nothing to do with the violence this week, and attributed it to ""Hindu hard-liners"" unaffiliated with his organization. But he did take issue with the Dalit version of the centuries-old battle. ""That battle was not decisive,"" he said. ""Nobody was defeated or victorious in that war."" Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra, told reporters on Tuesday that violence at the event had been contained by the police. ""Some people are trying to create caste tensions,"" he said. ""We should not allow them to succeed."" Dalits have made inroads in securing higher-paying jobs in India's public and private sectors. Prakash Ambedkar, the grandson of a Dalit leader, said at a news conference that celebrating the Battle of Koregaon represented a ""symbol of social and religious freedom"" for the community."
News,2018-01-04,"ALBANY — With a re-election campaign and potentially treacherous political terrain ahead, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo laid out his 2018 agenda on Wednesday, painting a portrait of a state battling the effects of terrorism, sexual harassment and opioid addiction, and under siege from the Trump administration.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/nyregion/albany-cuomo-state-of-the-state.html,1329," ALBANY — With a re-election campaign and potentially treacherous political terrain ahead, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo laid out his 2018 agenda on Wednesday, painting a portrait of a state battling the effects of terrorism, sexual harassment and opioid addiction, and under siege from the Trump administration. In his 90-minute State of the State speech, Mr. Cuomo said the state would challenge the new Republican-led federal tax plan in court — earning a standing ovation from the crowd — and asked the Legislature to restructure the state's tax code by adding a statewide payroll tax and to counter the effects of the so-called carried interest loophole. The governor's office suggested that it was reviewing eliminating the state income tax, whose deductibility was capped by the new federal tax bill, likely in favor of a payroll tax, which is deductible, an idea also being floated in other states. Precise details on the plan were scant, and such a plan would face an uphill battle, with Republicans generally opposing new taxes and some conservative economists already voicing concerns on Wednesday. The proposal to constrain the carried interest loophole — which allows a private equity partner or hedge fund manager to enjoy a lower tax rate on an investment's profits — would call for creating a compact with neighboring states that would impose a new tax on those taking advantage of the loophole. Still, with New York facing billions of dollars in budget gaps, and swaths of suburban voters possibly looking at tax increases as a result of the new cap on income and property tax deductibility, the initial reaction in Albany suggested the idea had a puncher's chance, including among some State Senate Republicans representing moderate districts. And Mr. Cuomo, whose angry rhetoric leading up to the passage of the federal tax bill had bordered on the extreme, seemed to be banking that he could unite New Yorkers on both sides of the aisle to fight against Washington. ""You're now robbing the blue states to pay for the red states,"" the governor said of the federal tax plan, calling it crass, ugly and partisan. ""It is an economic civil war."" Mr. Cuomo's eighth State of the State came amid one of the hardest economic outlooks of his time in office, including a $4 billion budget deficit. It also came at the fulcrum of a critical political moment for the governor, a Democrat expected to easily secure a third term in November whose name has been bandied about as a possible presidential contender in 2020. On one hand, the governor seems eager to use such speeches to reach for the kind of lofty rhetoric that also made his father, the former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a national figure. On Wednesday, in fact, he cited his father on several occasions, saying he was following the former governor's lead as a ""pragmatic progressive"" who had led the state into a position of being ""the nation's vanguard for social progress."" Mr. Cuomo cited accomplishments like raising the minimum wage, legalizing same-sex marriage and establishing a paid family leave program. And the agenda he laid out on Wednesday was a sweeping catchall of blue-sky ideas, from encouraging self-driving cars and drones to building what would be New York City's biggest state park on Jamaica Bay and extending a subway line to Red Hook in Brooklyn. All of which earned it a fair measure of skepticism from conservative leaders. ""I don't know how the heck anyone can conceive of paying for everything that was laid out,"" said John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican and the Senate majority leader, who questioned where the governor would find the funding to enact the myriad proposals. ""I always respect the ambition, but at some point, somebody's got to pay for it."" Edward F. Cox, the State Republican Party chairman, was more dismissive. ""Of course there are a lot of nice things in there that you have to applaud for,"" he said, mentioning the park plan, ""but the basic issues this coming election year are going to be corruption, which he's got plenty of them."" Indeed, Mr. Cuomo faces a daunting array of possible political pitfalls in 2018, including a series of corruption trials of close former aides, allies and associates, and a restive Democratic base hoping for stronger progressive stands from a politician known as a shrewd, if solipsistic, political dealmaker. In particular, the twisted calculus of the State Senate — where New York Republicans hold their sole foothold of power in the state thanks to a partnership with nine rogue Democrats — looks to present problems for the governor if he fails to broker or campaign hard for a Democratic majority, something some left-wing groups question his willingness to do. On Wednesday, however, progressive groups were embracing the idea of a payroll tax. ""It is smart and necessary for states to respond to the federal attack,"" said Michael Kink, executive director of the Strong Economy For All Coalition, a group of unions and community organizations that advocates for tax code reform and a higher minimum wage. Mr. Kink also praised the idea of eliminating the carried interest loophole, which he said hedge funds or private equity funds had long used to avoid paying the highest amount of income tax by classifying the fees they charged for managing investments as long-term capital gains. ""It's an entirely fictional legal accounting thing,"" Mr. Kink said. ""It basically allows them to pay a lower rate than teachers and truck drivers."" Mayor Bill de Blasio, recently re-elected, made the trip to Albany for the speech, receiving a warm applause from the crowd on Wednesday, despite often finding his agenda thwarted in the Capitol. Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio have feuded regularly, and Mr. Cuomo several times obliquely asserted his readiness to insert himself into New York City's affairs, including homelessness, saying he had directed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to increase outreach to homeless men and women. And the city's decaying subways — whose shoddy performance politically damaged the governor, who controls the M.T.A. — was also the source of a request for more financial backing, with Mr. Cuomo taking a veiled swipe at ""cheap political slogans"" that had failed to address the problems of the aging system. But on the issue of taxes, the mayor seemed to set aside any bad blood with the governor, saying he was heartened by the proposal on the payroll tax and calling it a ""creative solution."" ""Look, we want to protect New Yorkers from an unfair tax bill,"" Mr. de Blasio said. ""If there had been any sense in Washington of fairness and decency towards people all over the country, they never would've taken away state and local deductibility."" Perhaps aware of the help he would need in perilous financial times, Mr. Cuomo also repeatedly praised Albany's often-criticized lawmakers, saying he would need them to make hard financial choices, something he has prided himself on in the past, again being pragmatic about the state's needs. ""We should feel confident in our ability to govern,"" he said, ""and to do what many people believe can't be done."" The election of President Trump has given Mr. Cuomo the opportunity to present himself as a steward of progressive policies, and he has spent the better part of the last year attacking Washington — if not always the president by name — to burnish his own political brand. And while Mr. Cuomo mentioned Mr. Trump only once, chiding him for fomenting a divisive political culture, he characterized the cumulative effect of his administration as a ""federal assault"" that he likened to President Ford's 1975 decision to deny bankruptcy aid to the city (resulting in the famed ""FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD"" headline in The Daily News.) ""This federal government is the most hostile and aggressive toward New York in history,"" the governor said. ""It has shot an arrow aimed at New York's economic heart."""

It was wider at the bottom, sort of like an inverted funnel, and two buckles secured the flap. Babak Behzadzadeh knew exactly how he might use the bag when he saw it hanging in a shop in Playa del Carmen, Mexico: It could be his bank. Behzadzadeh owns two businesses in Denver. Avicenna Products makes potent marijuana concentrates. Next door, Green Sativa grows marijuana, which it sells directly through its own medical dispensary and store. By last spring, after just 18 months in operation, they were generating $250,000 to $350,000 in monthly sales, all of it in cash. During the workday, the satchel sat on a file cabinet in Behzadzadeh's small office at Avicenna, stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars that funded the two operations. One weekday afternoon last March, Avicenna's manager, Alex Elsberg, a bearish, bearded man with blue-tinted sunglasses perched on his crown, was prepared to drive a 100-mile circuit around Denver's north suburbs, where he would deliver concentrate to one dispensary, collect a payment from another and then, on his way back, visit a grower in Boulder to buy about 11 pounds of trim, the larger leaves that are stripped off the plants' flowers and are the raw material for concentrates. Behzadzadeh had agreed to pay $5,850 for the trim, and while Elsberg would collect at least that much in cash at his first two stops, he liked to separate the money coming in from the money going out. Elsberg walked into Behzadzadeh's office and over to the satchel, which is about the size of a small purse — Elsberg, who is 37, likes to call it Behzadzadeh's ""murse,"" for man purse — and removed six bundles of bills. He sat at the ornate wooden desk and on its inlaid-leather top began counting the bills in each thousand-dollar stack. Behzadzadeh, 50, was dressed in his customary uniform of brown leather vest and gray shirt, and he wore a silver Bluetooth headset like a necklace. As the men talked and laughed, a stack fell to the floor. ""One day, I brought in $6,000 from the safe from my store,"" Behzadzadeh reminisced. ""I put the money in the bag. The next day I was short a thousand dollars."" When the dispensary manager turned up nothing, Behzadzadeh grew alarmed. ""So Alex comes by to throw something in the garbage can, and there's a thousand dollars!"" They laughed heartily. ""If we had bank accounts,"" Behzadzadeh said, turning serious, ""it'd be much easier."" Growing and selling marijuana are, like using it, legal under Colorado law. But banks tend to take their cues from the federal government. Not only does selling marijuana violate federal law; handling the proceeds of any marijuana transaction is considered to be money laundering. Very few banks are willing to bear that risk. By the time Behzadzadeh took his Mexican beach vacation, he had already opened checking accounts for his businesses at Wells Fargo and Chase — and then saw them closed when the banks discovered what they were for. In most of the 22 states that, along with Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have legal marijuana markets, cash is not simply king; it is all-consuming. It is counted and recounted and stuffed into bulging envelopes, slid into back pockets and ferried around town in beaters and fully loaded S.U.V.s. Customers exchange it for marijuana at the counter; businesses use it to buy weed from wholesalers and for gardening supplies, plastic bottles and lab equipment. They use it for money orders at grocery stores. It pays employees and the rent and electric bills and taxes. It is fed into owners' personal bank accounts at A.T.M.s. On Jan. 1, California, which has permitted medical marijuana for decades, began allowing legal sales of recreational marijuana, creating a potential market many times the size of Colorado's, with the potential for many more banking headaches. But for Behzadzadeh, a solution lay in sight. In the fall of 2016, Elsberg and another employee, both veterans in the marijuana industry, put him in touch with Sundie Seefried, the chief executive of Partner Colorado, a credit union in Arvada, a Denver suburb. A division of the credit union, Safe Harbor Private Banking, provides checking accounts expressly for the marijuana industry, in clear violation of federal law. Partner Colorado was originally chartered in 1931 to serve postal workers; with about $350 million in assets, it still amounts to little more than a rounding error in the state's financial-services market. But in three years it has established itself, entirely through word of mouth, as the marijuana industry's biggest banker. These clients deposited $931 million in 2017. No other United States bank or credit union has probably taken as much, says Robert McVay, a Seattle-based lawyer who advises institutions on banking marijuana business. Most of those deposits are cash, taken off the streets and thereby reducing the latent, associated threat of robbery — a threat not just to those working in the industry but also to the ordinary people around them. As one banker put it to me, ""I don't want to stand in line next to a backpack filled with $30,000"" while someone fills out money orders. To manage these accounts, Seefried — working largely alone, in order to shield her colleagues from possible prosecution — created a sophisticated process to match deposits and withdrawals to marijuana transactions that are legal in the state. Seefried's bankers delve deeply into nearly every aspect of their clients' finances and operations. ""I said it in every interview in the beginning,"" Seefried told me. "" 'You have to understand: We're going to be the nosiest banker you ever had.' "" Five other small banks in the state also offer checking accounts to the industry and many more make occasional exceptions for companies owned by longtime customers, according to people who study and work in Colorado's marijuana industry. (They don't lend them money, though, because the federal authorities could seize whatever collateral backs a loan.) But it's difficult to say how many of these businesses have bank accounts in their own name, because most banks refuse to publicly discuss this line of business, and they require clients to sign agreements promising not to discuss the relationship. A similar situation exists in Washington State, where voters legalized buying and using recreational marijuana in 2012, when Colorado did. Seefried, by contrast, is happy to talk about it. ""Her openness to partner with me to teach stakeholders has been second to none,"" says Chris Myklebust, who oversaw Safe Harbor and every other financial institution chartered in Colorado as the state's banking-and-financial-services commissioner until he left the job in November. Seefried often accompanied Myklebust around the country to explain to state officials and bankers how marijuana banking works in Colorado. ""She understands the burden of being a financial institution serving the legal marijuana industry,"" he said. (She has also written a book, ""Navigating Safe Harbor,"" about it.) Seefried has managed to build a large and expanding portfolio of accounts that so far has withstood federal scrutiny. She hasn't been indicted, and she hasn't been told to stop. Seefried has concluded that, for the moment at least, her chances of facing prosecution are small — ""less than 20 percent,"" she says. Last spring, Behzadzadeh was gathering up dozens of business and financial records to send to her, and it was taking weeks. ""Sundie,"" he moaned one day after taking a call from his compliance officer, who was helping compile the paperwork. ""She wants my firstborn"" — and, he added, his left testicle. In the meantime, cash kept moving through the business. After returning from his rounds, Elsberg laid a pair of invoices on the table. Then he handed Behzadzadeh a No.10 envelope bulging with bills. Elsberg had already counted the money when he received it; now Behzadzadeh began counting it for himself, separating it into thousand-dollar stacks, before depositing them into the satchel. Then, having double-checked the totals, he entered each payment into his QuickBooks ledger and then into a Google spreadsheet that served as a cash log. The invoices are filed in case an inspector from the state's Marijuana Enforcement Division comes calling. Every dollar that comes into Behzadzadeh's companies is counted by Behzadzadeh or one of his employees at least three times before it goes out again. ""I've gotten to the routine where I need to put my own elastic bands around them,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""That way, I know I counted them."" Seefried imagined that these would be her golden years, time spent at her vacation house in Santa Fe painting desert flowers in the style of Georgia O'Keeffe. Seefried is just 56, but she was a credit-union veteran when she joined Partner Colorado in 1995; as its chief executive, she kept it profitable through the 2007 recession. In a stodgy industry, Seefried stands out, tall and even a little glamorous. In 2014, as her husband prepared to retire from another credit union, in Colorado Springs, she made plans to wind down her own career. Then one summer evening, while out for drinks, a group of lawyer friends confronted her with a question: Why couldn't their marijuana-industry clients get bank accounts? Seefried had in fact wondered about marijuana banking before. But, she said, ""nobody wanted to talk about it."" Now, buttonholed by her friends, she promised to investigate. She discovered that the conflict over marijuana — permitted by the state, prohibited by the United States — in Colorado and elsewhere has created a strange and uncertain legal landscape. ""It prevents either state law or federal law on marijuana from being effectively implemented,"" says John Walsh, who served as the United States attorney in Colorado from 2010 to 2016. Even Colorado officials who opposed legalizing marijuana — among them Gov. John Hickenlooper — support banking the proceeds, and not only because it reduces the prospect of robbery and violence. State laws carefully control, and heavily tax, marijuana distribution; regulators and law-enforcement officers investigating violators rely on the paper trails bank accounts leave behind. Banking, says Andrew Freedman, who for more than two years was the governor's director of marijuana coordination, ""is a really great redundant measure to make sure people are playing clean."" But that's not a view broadly shared by federal officials. Seefried says she was astonished last year when a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, speaking at a forum at the state Capitol, made the same slippery-slope argument against banking marijuana that is often made against smoking it: It would lead to banking cocaine, heroin and so on. Since Colorado's first medical-marijuana dispensaries opened their doors in 2009, the Department of Justice has seesawed between tolerating and prosecuting the nascent industry. National institutions like Wells Fargo, which had fished for clients at marijuana-industry conferences, were the first to abandon the field. Local banks followed, though a handful continued to serve some marijuana businesses discreetly. A game of cat and mouse ensued: Businesses would open an account under an innocuous-sounding name; after a few months of large cash deposits, the bank would investigate and close the account. When bankers noticed that currency from marijuana business reeked, enterprising owners began spraying it with Febreeze. In 2013, the Justice Department decided to focus on what it called ""the most-significant threats"" in marijuana trafficking. A memo from the deputy attorney general, James Cole, established eight priorities for federal law enforcement to investigate, such as a legal business as a front for other criminal activity, diverting marijuana to states where it remains illegal and selling marijuana to children. Yet around the same time, D.E.A. agents began showing up at bank offices in Colorado to remind executives that as far as the federal government was concerned, the whole industry remained illegal. The state bankers' association formally urged its members to avoid marijuana businesses. But to Seefried's great surprise, none of her state regulators did likewise. ""Everybody knew this money needed to be banked,"" she told me. ""They knew it."" In 2014, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network published guidance intending to clarify ""how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses."" To prevent money laundering, the Treasury Department, which protects the financial system from infiltration by illicit money, advised banks to know their customers. In this case, the government said, they had to satisfy themselves that clients weren't engaged in any of the prohibited activities in the Cole memo. And to comply with federal money-laundering law, they had to alert the department whenever money moved in and out of a marijuana business's account. The agency, in turn, makes those reports available to law enforcement. Most bankers did not take much comfort from the guidance, which could be retracted as easily as it was put forward, because read narrowly, it only explained how to report marijuana transactions to the government. It gave no assurance that banks would not face prosecution for money laundering. And not just money laundering: Partner Colorado's lawyer warned Seefried that the government could also charge her and the credit union's volunteer board with racketeering, a charge of criminal conspiracy that stiffens any penalties. ""All he kept saying to me during my research was, 'Sundie, there's no safe harbor.' "" The credit union's accountant advised her to read Piper Kerman's prison memoir, ""Orange Is the New Black."" Seefried, though, saw a way forward. Working off-hours at home with the blessing of Partner Colorado's board, she outlined the steps the credit union could take to demonstrate convincingly that marijuana-business clients were complying with the Cole memo. She named her vetting program Safe Harbor Private Banking. Forget the hippie colonies up in the mountains. The epicenter of Colorado marijuana production lies in Denver's north-side industrial district straddling I-70, where railroad spurs weave between warehouses, distribution centers and factories. Sharp-eyed visitors will quickly notice the signs of a cannabis facility: cameras over every entrance, hazmat signs and enormous HVAC systems. Avicenna and Green Sativa share a block with another licensed cultivation facility — a ""grow,"" in the crunchy slang that lingers from the underground days — and, according to Behzadzadeh's employees, possibly an unlicensed one, too. Avicenna is named for the Persian scholar who wrote ""The Canon of Medicine"" a thousand years ago. Behzadzadeh grew up in Iran, in a resolutely secular family; even as a boy, he couldn't stomach the fundamentalist clerics brought to power by the Iranian revolution. In 1983, when he was just 15, he left Iran by himself to join an older brother in the United States, arriving with almost no money. Behzadzadeh settled in Rhode Island, where he trained as a pharmacist. After seven years filling prescriptions, he found his way into software consulting and got rich before concluding that encroaching global consultancies would eventually swallow his business. At the time, Colorado was drafting the regulations governing the sale of recreational marijuana. ""I knew that this is a business of compliance before it's anything marijuana,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""I did not have a problem following the rules and regulations in pharmacy, so this would not be that difficult."" State and often local requirements govern every aspect of Colorado's marijuana trade to ensure safety and that no plant is grown or sold outside the licensed system, where it could evade taxation or end up in the hands of people not allowed to have it. Behzadzadeh led me to Avicenna's extraction room, where butane, under high pressure, is used to separate the psychoactive chemicals of cannabis from its leaves; Behzadzadeh, per Denver Fire Department regulations and at great expense, made the room blastproof. Next we stopped at the safe where he's obliged to store the drugs and any cash on hand at day's end. A few feet away, a young woman named Angel wielded a tool resembling a dental pick to pack small plastic vials with a sticky extract called wax, using a state-inspected scale, and a young man applied state-designed product labels onto state-mandated opaque plastic bottles. Other young men — apart from Angel, they were all men — supervised extracts baking in specialized ovens. In Behzadzadeh's office, we could watch all the activity in the building, including ourselves, watching all the activity, from 16 recorded camera feeds on a 50-inch monitor behind his desk. Another monitor over the couch displayed his dispensary 10 miles away in Federal Heights from four perspectives. But for all the regulatory rigor, the flux of cash requires adjustments on the fly that no business with a checkbook, let alone a line of credit, would have to face. That week, for example, Behzadzadeh hoped to parcel out his $22,000 payroll on Thursday. But the satchel was a little light. He had given a contractor $17,000 as a down payment on a new roof for his grow, which he was in the process of expanding. And a concentrates customer found itself short on cash, so Behzadzadeh agreed to split the product with the client and forgo a $7,000 payment. There was money in the safe at the dispensary, but nobody had time to go pick it up. So it was not until Friday morning that Elsberg walked into the office and pulled four thick envelopes from his jacket pocket containing $18,299.13: four days' worth of sales at the dispensary. Each envelope bore the day's total — the money had already been counted at the store, twice — but now Elsberg sat down at Behzadzadeh's big leather chair and pulled the cash out of an envelope. At one point, a loose note fluttered to the floor, blown by the ceiling fan. When Behzadzadeh finally sat down to disburse the payroll, it was after 5 p.m. He lugged a large vase full of change (the ""genie bottle"") over to the couch, retrieved from the satchel 22 thousand-dollar bundles, plus a big stack of small-denomination bills that he'd been collecting all week, and then laid it all on a cushion beside him. The first pay stub showed $932.81. Behzadzadeh took a thousand-dollar stack, peeled off a $100, which went into a new pile, and collected $32 from the small-bill stack. Then he reached into the genie bottle to retrieve the change, folded the stub and put it in an envelope with the cash. Walking out into the Friday twilight, very few of Behzadzadeh's employees probably gave much thought to the wad of cash in their pockets. But everyone in the business can recall one or another infamous crime — clerks forced to open a safe at gunpoint in a dispensary on East Colfax; the murder of a security guard in Aurora — and some spectacular heists have gone largely unreported, as when thieves broke through the roof of one grow and then cut open its safe. For these businesses, robbery poses an existential threat. The money is often gone — insurance to reimburse the loss is, naturally, expensive — replaced, potentially, by new costs for tighter security or tougher regulations or, in the case of a store, by damage to its veneer of safety. All of Behzadzadeh's cameras at Avicenna couldn't have protected his satchel from intruders with guns. ""It would only take one really effective rip-off gang,"" Walsh, the former U.S. attorney, says, ""to terrorize that industry."" Applying for a Safe Harbor checking account is an invasive procedure. The credit union first tries to learn as much as it can about the company and its owners, beginning with an hourlong interview, followed by the document collection that Behzadzadeh found so aggravating: lists of owners, investors, vendors and customers; financial statements and tax forms; the business's organizing documents; state licenses; leases, handbooks and more. The documents can multiply quickly, because marijuana businesses are often a web of affiliated companies with overlapping ownership. Each often gets its own bank account. Once the accounts are opened, Safe Harbor's bankers inspect the business and its premises as frequently as every three months, to confirm that it hews to all of Colorado's rules. Treasury's guidance implies that a bank can't properly make sure that a client stays on the right side of the Cole memo without a rigorous state licensing and regulatory plan in place, according to McVay, the Seattle lawyer. This, he says, explains why California's large medical-marijuana sector mostly lacks access to banking services: Local governments oversee the business, and with a very light touch. The state won't implement comprehensive regulations until later this year at the earliest. Safe Harbor bankers spend most of their time monitoring client transactions, tying every dollar the bank takes in to a legitimate sale and making sure that no dollar withdrawn disappears into the illicit economy. Each month, they reconcile the account activity to a company's ledger and the sales it reports, as well as to all the other information they've gleaned about a client, such as which companies it normally trades with. The credit union has compiled reams of data about how money moves around the marijuana industry, and bankers regularly compare notes about the transactions they see. When an unusual deposit arrives — larger than typical, say, or from a new source — the banker holds the money until the client can account for it. Seefried recalls how a banker noticed that one dispensary seemed to have customers with unusually deep pockets: its sales averaged $300 to $400 each, while medical-marijuana patients generally spend less than $100 at dispensaries. The banker interrogated the client and, from the parking lot, even staked out the dispensary and studied its customers. In the end, still mystified by how the dispensary made its money, Safe Harbor closed the account. ""You cannot bank what you don't understand,"" Seefried says. Safe Harbor has closed three other accounts after members broke various credit-union rules, indicating that they weren't willing to be fully transparent with their bankers. Late last summer, Seefried ejected three more members after bankers, working with money-laundering experts, detected suspicious activity. And another three closed their accounts rather than comply with her increasingly strict requirements, including one that customers deposit 90 percent of their receipts. The rule, she acknowledges, was mainly intended to weed out less-committed clients: Only a business trying to hide its transactions would be put off by it. Last June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado's federal regulator, conducted its annual examination of the credit union's books and practices, and for the third year in a row, had no complaints about Safe Harbor. Today the program consists of 13 people, including five responsible solely for compliance. Most are women. (Women manage more than half of all credit unions.) When Seefried hires bankers for Partner Colorado, she gravitates toward sociable people. For Safe Harbor, she says she prefers introverts or, at the very least, people who evince precision and curiosity. This sort of meticulous banking isn't cheap. For each $100,000 deposited at Safe Harbor, a client pays $450 in fees in the first year and $300 thereafter. (Client companies that serve the marijuana industry but don't actually sell the drugs, like laboratories, require much less vetting and so pay much lower fees.) Seefried says the Safe Harbor program made a modest profit in its first year — less than $200,000. It became much more lucrative for the credit union in 2016, but Seefried won't reveal specifics. According to federal data, most of the institution's sources of income have stayed relatively steady since 2014, but fee income has grown to a projected $5 million in 2017 from nearly $3 million. Seefried says that about three-quarters of Safe Harbor's marijuana-selling clients pay less than $1,000 a month per account, considerably less than they would pay at banks, where monthly account fees are said to start at $1,500. Many observers assume that the opportunity to assess lucrative fees is what entices small banks to take on these risky accounts. Federal data show that at Champion Bank, in suburban Denver, which began explicitly working with marijuana businesses in 2014, annual fee revenue on deposit accounts increased by a factor of 68 from 2013 to 2016, to $752,000 from $11,000, even as its main line of business, providing loans, shrank. At Colorado Bank and Trust in La Junta, fees grew elevenfold to $2.9 million. For marijuana businesses, engaging with the financial mainstream has kept them mostly free from legal trouble. Safe Harbor has received subpoenas for the bank records of only four of the just over 200 clients it has had. None has yet been indicted. John Walsh can recall prosecuting one case against regulated dispensaries and none against a business serving the industry. But working without a checking account makes even an otherwise law-abiding business look evasive, says Lewis Koski, who served as the first director of the state's Marijuana Enforcement Division, which collects marijuana taxes and regulates the industry, before he joined Andrew Freedman in a consulting venture. A cash-management technique like personal deposits structured to evade notice can legally amount to money laundering. ""Banking,"" Koski says, ""just provides a really clear picture of where money is coming in and where money is going out."" On the last Wednesday of last March, Kim Oliver, Partner Colorado's executive vice president, pulled her old, mud-streaked silver Jetta into Avicenna's parking lot. She had come from her ranch, east of Denver. She was dressed formally and seemed intently focused on the business at hand. Seefried had reviewed all of Behzadzadeh's paperwork; now only an inspection stood between him and a bank account. Behzadzadeh gave Oliver a warm welcome, and Elsberg took her ID, signed her in and gave her a visitor badge. Oliver made a mental note: the first small compliance test, passed. Oliver, who is 59, has worked in credit unions all her adult life. Earlier she had confided to me a lifelong hostility to marijuana and rage when she discovered that her son-in-law, a veteran suffering from PTSD and living in her house, was cultivating a small crop in her basement. But working on Safe Harbor had forced her to reconsider her views on medical marijuana. ""I found out that he wasn't blowing smoke,"" she told me. (I couldn't tell if she intended the pun.) ""That was my whole thing: You're just trying to have an excuse to smoke dope."" She now supplies her arthritic mother with topical creams that contain cannabidiol, a chemical compound in the marijuana flower that doesn't produce a high but that medical-marijuana advocates believe reduces inflammation. Oliver sat down with Behzadzadeh and Elsberg at a gray marble table in the kitchenette just inside the employee entrance. She began the formal inspection by going through a checklist: six pages long, scores of questions. The first series delved into Behzadzadeh's financial practices and the second into business procedures. These were meant to assess Behzadzadeh's compliance with state regulations. Then she read five or six questions about each of the eight Cole memo priorities. After a response, Oliver made a check — almost always ""yes"" — and sometimes wrote a little note beside it. ""If you had an employee, and they cut a bud off,"" she asked at one point, ""how would you catch who did that?"" ""Cut a bud off"" — the phrase in Oliver's Great Plains twang was disorienting. One of the incongruities in Colorado's marijuana business is how professionals new to the trade adopt the Mendocino idiom without either irony or any particular reverence, the way their clothes absorb the plant's scent after a few hours on site. The industry's brand-builders prefer more sanitized language when talking to the public: ""adult use"" for ""recreational"" and ""cannabis"" for ""marijuana."" Elsberg replied, ""That's the beauty of it — we have cameras on everything."" The questions, and especially the answers, occasionally delved into minutiae, as when Behzadzadeh noted that he had hired a man to drive the perimeter of his two buildings hourly every night. Oliver raised an eyebrow. ""He's legal,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""I checked his sosh"" — Social Security number. ""I checked his driver's license."" He deadpanned, ""I sent a copy to Jeff Sessions, too."" Next, Oliver went about documenting compliance, snapping photos of the cameras, the safes, the locks on cabinets and other equipment, the bars blocking the windows and even the eyewash station. She walked over to a bakery-bun rack and photographed the RFID tag lying next to a brittle sheet of an extract known as shatter. Then she had an employee type the tag number into the state record system to call up that batch's history. She visited the grow next door (""I'm surprised they have as many cameras that they do,"" she remarked approvingly afterward) and then followed Behzadzadeh and Elsberg up to the dispensary in Federal Heights. The dispensary inspection got off to a rocky start when Oliver noticed the A.T.M. near the entrance. Cash-machine companies often rent them to dispensaries and stores, because so few can accept credit cards, but Behzadzadeh owned his and each week filled it with $2,000 in cash taken from the register. ""That's got to change,"" Oliver said matter-of-factly. ""The biggest way of laundering money is through the A.T.M."" Behzadzadeh's machine was tied to a personal bank account; every time a customer withdrew cash, that account received a credit. But the register money was unaccounted for; it could come from anywhere. Now, Oliver told him, he would have to withdraw money from Safe Harbor and hire an armored car to deliver the cash and fill the A.T.M.; he couldn't even touch it himself. A look of incredulity crossed Behzadzadeh's face. ""Wait — I'm not going to give my business to somebody else!"" he said. As a start-up entrepreneur, Behzadzadeh nursed a swelling grudge against the contractors and vendors who nickeled and dimed him, he thought, at every turn — maybe even Safe Harbor. The cost of banking was one thing, but the prospect of trading the satchel for an armored car from a company like Blue Line, another niche player that charged a premium in a niche industry, especially galled him. ""I have no problem doing business with you guys, and I appreciate the banking, but I'm not going to pay Blue Line to take my money,"" he said, his voice rising. ""There's no way."" Oliver kept pressing. ""All they're doing is loading the machine for you,"" she said. ""If I wanted to be on the black market, I would come in here and fill this machine all the time to clean the money."" ""Ah,"" Behzadzadeh said. Now he understood. He thought out loud: He would bring cash from Avicenna to the dispensary and give it to a courier, who would put different cash, which he had brought with him, into the A.T.M. ""While you're doing that"" — Behzadzadeh addressed the imaginary courier — ""I'll make you coffee."" Behzadzadeh's dogs were barking ferociously when he and his wife returned home from dinner late one night in September. They didn't think anything of it, but several hours later, the couple heard noises in their house. Behzadzadeh gathered his wife and children in a bedroom and raced downstairs with a laser-sighted pistol. But the intruders were gone, along with his cellphone — and the satchel. The robbery could have been a financial disaster. A month earlier, the Denver Fire Department had determined that the extraction room at Avicenna was not sufficiently blastproof, shutting down the factory for two months. ""If they had taken $30,000 or $40,000,"" Behzadzadeh said, ""it would have literally broken my back."" But the satchel held no money that night. Behzadzadeh had opened his bank accounts the morning after the inspection. It had taken him a few months to fully embrace them — Seefried had predicted as much — but now around two-thirds of his trading partners also accept or write checks. What cash remains in Behzadzadeh's business waits in safes, secured to the floor, for the armored truck. Yet despite Safe Harbor's efforts and those of its competitors, bank accounts remain out of reach for many Colorado marijuana companies. The high fees put off smaller businesses at the same time as banks seem to be pulling back. Seefried didn't want Safe Harbor deposits to swamp the credit union, so last January she reduced the number of new monthly clients from five to three and then closed the door altogether in August after deposits ballooned over the summer. As the state Marijuana Enforcement Division granted licenses to about 220 additional companies last year through November, Safe Harbor's waiting list swelled to 96 businesses, or two-and-a-half-years' worth of new clients, before the credit union stopped adding names to it. The five banks have become very stingy about granting new accounts, according to three C.P.A.s who have marijuana-industry clients. The parent company of one of those institutions, Colorado National Bank, declared bankruptcy in November, putting its future as a marijuana banker in doubt. Marijuana banking has always depended entirely on forbearance from Washington, and the Trump administration seems decidedly less tolerant than its predecessor. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions declared before a gathering of law-enforcement officials that marijuana is ""only slightly less awful"" than heroin. ""I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store,"" he said. A task force assembled in February by the Justice Department to combat violent crime didn't recommend any changes to the Cole memo when it delivered its initial findings last summer, but the agency is very likely revising it. (The Justice Department wouldn't comment on its deliberations.) [Update: After this article went to press, the Justice Department rescinded the Cole memo, giving U.S. attorneys more latitude to enforce federal marijuana laws in their districts.] Seefried had hoped to begin making loans to and processing credit-card transactions for Safe Harbor's existing clients, but for the foreseeable future, she has put those plans on hold. Until federal law catches up to public sentiment, marijuana banking is unlikely to keep pace with the industry — the vetting is too expensive. Just last month, after a client was caught up in a police investigation, Safe Harbor had to review the account to make sure bankers hadn't missed any suspicious activity. ""It cost me $30,000: $20,000 to bring in investigators for three days and $10,000 for legal fees,"" Seefried told me. ""That's one client, with one problem."" She plans to raise fees in the next couple months. Yet she still hopes to position Safe Harbor as a model for banking the marijuana industry elsewhere. In November, Safe Harbor began licensing its name and protocols to financial institutions nationwide. Six banks and credit unions in six states will begin taking on customers this month, including a credit union in Colorado to serve the customers that Safe Harbor no longer can. Three more will join each quarter. Safe Harbor is also testing a mobile-phone app for buying marijuana in Hawaii's handful of state-licensed dispensaries. In June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado's regulator, advised Seefried that it would begin examining the institution quarterly rather than yearly, which she attributes to the national expansion. She has hired two full-time employees just to manage the increased compliance. ""We are bringing more credit unions to the table, and they don't want us teaching them incorrectly,"" she says. One industry investment facilitator, the Arcview Group, estimates that legal marijuana sales in the United States will more than double to roughly $21 billion by 2021 from nearly $9 billion last year. Walsh, the former prosecutor, has concluded that the tension between the federal government and liberalizing states is unsustainable. ""I came in as U.S. attorney in 2010 assuming that it was my job to enforce the federal marijuana laws regardless of what state legalization efforts would look like,"" he says. ""The longer I worked on the issue, and we struggled with it, the more I realized that a simple shut-it-down approach was not practical. The notion that you can put this genie back in the bottle today is not realistic."""
Interactive Feature,2018-01-04,"How the field is changing, and how it could help address a problem for men: The fastest-growing jobs are mostly done by women.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/04/upshot/male-nurses.html,0," The small burgundy satchel bore the hallmarks of rugged craftsmanship: top-grain leather, double stitching on the straps. It was wider at the bottom, sort of like an inverted funnel, and two buckles secured the flap. Babak Behzadzadeh knew exactly how he might use the bag when he saw it hanging in a shop in Playa del Carmen, Mexico: It could be his bank. Behzadzadeh owns two businesses in Denver. Avicenna Products makes potent marijuana concentrates. Next door, Green Sativa grows marijuana, which it sells directly through its own medical dispensary and store. By last spring, after just 18 months in operation, they were generating $250,000 to $350,000 in monthly sales, all of it in cash. During the workday, the satchel sat on a file cabinet in Behzadzadeh's small office at Avicenna, stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars that funded the two operations. One weekday afternoon last March, Avicenna's manager, Alex Elsberg, a bearish, bearded man with blue-tinted sunglasses perched on his crown, was prepared to drive a 100-mile circuit around Denver's north suburbs, where he would deliver concentrate to one dispensary, collect a payment from another and then, on his way back, visit a grower in Boulder to buy about 11 pounds of trim, the larger leaves that are stripped off the plants' flowers and are the raw material for concentrates. Behzadzadeh had agreed to pay $5,850 for the trim, and while Elsberg would collect at least that much in cash at his first two stops, he liked to separate the money coming in from the money going out. Elsberg walked into Behzadzadeh's office and over to the satchel, which is about the size of a small purse — Elsberg, who is 37, likes to call it Behzadzadeh's ""murse,"" for man purse — and removed six bundles of bills. He sat at the ornate wooden desk and on its inlaid-leather top began counting the bills in each thousand-dollar stack. Behzadzadeh, 50, was dressed in his customary uniform of brown leather vest and gray shirt, and he wore a silver Bluetooth headset like a necklace. As the men talked and laughed, a stack fell to the floor. ""One day, I brought in $6,000 from the safe from my store,"" Behzadzadeh reminisced. ""I put the money in the bag. The next day I was short a thousand dollars."" When the dispensary manager turned up nothing, Behzadzadeh grew alarmed. ""So Alex comes by to throw something in the garbage can, and there's a thousand dollars!"" They laughed heartily. ""If we had bank accounts,"" Behzadzadeh said, turning serious, ""it'd be much easier."" Growing and selling marijuana are, like using it, legal under Colorado law. But banks tend to take their cues from the federal government. Not only does selling marijuana violate federal law; handling the proceeds of any marijuana transaction is considered to be money laundering. Very few banks are willing to bear that risk. By the time Behzadzadeh took his Mexican beach vacation, he had already opened checking accounts for his businesses at Wells Fargo and Chase — and then saw them closed when the banks discovered what they were for. In most of the 22 states that, along with Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have legal marijuana markets, cash is not simply king; it is all-consuming. It is counted and recounted and stuffed into bulging envelopes, slid into back pockets and ferried around town in beaters and fully loaded S.U.V.s. Customers exchange it for marijuana at the counter; businesses use it to buy weed from wholesalers and for gardening supplies, plastic bottles and lab equipment. They use it for money orders at grocery stores. It pays employees and the rent and electric bills and taxes. It is fed into owners' personal bank accounts at A.T.M.s. On Jan. 1, California, which has permitted medical marijuana for decades, began allowing legal sales of recreational marijuana, creating a potential market many times the size of Colorado's, with the potential for many more banking headaches. But for Behzadzadeh, a solution lay in sight. In the fall of 2016, Elsberg and another employee, both veterans in the marijuana industry, put him in touch with Sundie Seefried, the chief executive of Partner Colorado, a credit union in Arvada, a Denver suburb. A division of the credit union, Safe Harbor Private Banking, provides checking accounts expressly for the marijuana industry, in clear violation of federal law. Partner Colorado was originally chartered in 1931 to serve postal workers; with about $350 million in assets, it still amounts to little more than a rounding error in the state's financial-services market. But in three years it has established itself, entirely through word of mouth, as the marijuana industry's biggest banker. These clients deposited $931 million in 2017. No other United States bank or credit union has probably taken as much, says Robert McVay, a Seattle-based lawyer who advises institutions on banking marijuana business. Most of those deposits are cash, taken off the streets and thereby reducing the latent, associated threat of robbery — a threat not just to those working in the industry but also to the ordinary people around them. As one banker put it to me, ""I don't want to stand in line next to a backpack filled with $30,000"" while someone fills out money orders. To manage these accounts, Seefried — working largely alone, in order to shield her colleagues from possible prosecution — created a sophisticated process to match deposits and withdrawals to marijuana transactions that are legal in the state. Seefried's bankers delve deeply into nearly every aspect of their clients' finances and operations. ""I said it in every interview in the beginning,"" Seefried told me. "" 'You have to understand: We're going to be the nosiest banker you ever had.' "" Five other small banks in the state also offer checking accounts to the industry and many more make occasional exceptions for companies owned by longtime customers, according to people who study and work in Colorado's marijuana industry. (They don't lend them money, though, because the federal authorities could seize whatever collateral backs a loan.) But it's difficult to say how many of these businesses have bank accounts in their own name, because most banks refuse to publicly discuss this line of business, and they require clients to sign agreements promising not to discuss the relationship. A similar situation exists in Washington State, where voters legalized buying and using recreational marijuana in 2012, when Colorado did. Seefried, by contrast, is happy to talk about it. ""Her openness to partner with me to teach stakeholders has been second to none,"" says Chris Myklebust, who oversaw Safe Harbor and every other financial institution chartered in Colorado as the state's banking-and-financial-services commissioner until he left the job in November. Seefried often accompanied Myklebust around the country to explain to state officials and bankers how marijuana banking works in Colorado. ""She understands the burden of being a financial institution serving the legal marijuana industry,"" he said. (She has also written a book, ""Navigating Safe Harbor,"" about it.) Seefried has managed to build a large and expanding portfolio of accounts that so far has withstood federal scrutiny. She hasn't been indicted, and she hasn't been told to stop. Seefried has concluded that, for the moment at least, her chances of facing prosecution are small — ""less than 20 percent,"" she says. Last spring, Behzadzadeh was gathering up dozens of business and financial records to send to her, and it was taking weeks. ""Sundie,"" he moaned one day after taking a call from his compliance officer, who was helping compile the paperwork. ""She wants my firstborn"" — and, he added, his left testicle. In the meantime, cash kept moving through the business. After returning from his rounds, Elsberg laid a pair of invoices on the table. Then he handed Behzadzadeh a No.10 envelope bulging with bills. Elsberg had already counted the money when he received it; now Behzadzadeh began counting it for himself, separating it into thousand-dollar stacks, before depositing them into the satchel. Then, having double-checked the totals, he entered each payment into his QuickBooks ledger and then into a Google spreadsheet that served as a cash log. The invoices are filed in case an inspector from the state's Marijuana Enforcement Division comes calling. Every dollar that comes into Behzadzadeh's companies is counted by Behzadzadeh or one of his employees at least three times before it goes out again. ""I've gotten to the routine where I need to put my own elastic bands around them,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""That way, I know I counted them."" Seefried imagined that these would be her golden years, time spent at her vacation house in Santa Fe painting desert flowers in the style of Georgia O'Keeffe. Seefried is just 56, but she was a credit-union veteran when she joined Partner Colorado in 1995; as its chief executive, she kept it profitable through the 2007 recession. In a stodgy industry, Seefried stands out, tall and even a little glamorous. In 2014, as her husband prepared to retire from another credit union, in Colorado Springs, she made plans to wind down her own career. Then one summer evening, while out for drinks, a group of lawyer friends confronted her with a question: Why couldn't their marijuana-industry clients get bank accounts? Seefried had in fact wondered about marijuana banking before. But, she said, ""nobody wanted to talk about it."" Now, buttonholed by her friends, she promised to investigate. She discovered that the conflict over marijuana — permitted by the state, prohibited by the United States — in Colorado and elsewhere has created a strange and uncertain legal landscape. ""It prevents either state law or federal law on marijuana from being effectively implemented,"" says John Walsh, who served as the United States attorney in Colorado from 2010 to 2016. Even Colorado officials who opposed legalizing marijuana — among them Gov. John Hickenlooper — support banking the proceeds, and not only because it reduces the prospect of robbery and violence. State laws carefully control, and heavily tax, marijuana distribution; regulators and law-enforcement officers investigating violators rely on the paper trails bank accounts leave behind. Banking, says Andrew Freedman, who for more than two years was the governor's director of marijuana coordination, ""is a really great redundant measure to make sure people are playing clean."" But that's not a view broadly shared by federal officials. Seefried says she was astonished last year when a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, speaking at a forum at the state Capitol, made the same slippery-slope argument against banking marijuana that is often made against smoking it: It would lead to banking cocaine, heroin and so on. Since Colorado's first medical-marijuana dispensaries opened their doors in 2009, the Department of Justice has seesawed between tolerating and prosecuting the nascent industry. National institutions like Wells Fargo, which had fished for clients at marijuana-industry conferences, were the first to abandon the field. Local banks followed, though a handful continued to serve some marijuana businesses discreetly. A game of cat and mouse ensued: Businesses would open an account under an innocuous-sounding name; after a few months of large cash deposits, the bank would investigate and close the account. When bankers noticed that currency from marijuana business reeked, enterprising owners began spraying it with Febreeze. In 2013, the Justice Department decided to focus on what it called ""the most-significant threats"" in marijuana trafficking. A memo from the deputy attorney general, James Cole, established eight priorities for federal law enforcement to investigate, such as a legal business as a front for other criminal activity, diverting marijuana to states where it remains illegal and selling marijuana to children. Yet around the same time, D.E.A. agents began showing up at bank offices in Colorado to remind executives that as far as the federal government was concerned, the whole industry remained illegal. The state bankers' association formally urged its members to avoid marijuana businesses. But to Seefried's great surprise, none of her state regulators did likewise. ""Everybody knew this money needed to be banked,"" she told me. ""They knew it."" In 2014, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network published guidance intending to clarify ""how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses."" To prevent money laundering, the Treasury Department, which protects the financial system from infiltration by illicit money, advised banks to know their customers. In this case, the government said, they had to satisfy themselves that clients weren't engaged in any of the prohibited activities in the Cole memo. And to comply with federal money-laundering law, they had to alert the department whenever money moved in and out of a marijuana business's account. The agency, in turn, makes those reports available to law enforcement. Most bankers did not take much comfort from the guidance, which could be retracted as easily as it was put forward, because read narrowly, it only explained how to report marijuana transactions to the government. It gave no assurance that banks would not face prosecution for money laundering. And not just money laundering: Partner Colorado's lawyer warned Seefried that the government could also charge her and the credit union's volunteer board with racketeering, a charge of criminal conspiracy that stiffens any penalties. ""All he kept saying to me during my research was, 'Sundie, there's no safe harbor.' "" The credit union's accountant advised her to read Piper Kerman's prison memoir, ""Orange Is the New Black."" Seefried, though, saw a way forward. Working off-hours at home with the blessing of Partner Colorado's board, she outlined the steps the credit union could take to demonstrate convincingly that marijuana-business clients were complying with the Cole memo. She named her vetting program Safe Harbor Private Banking. Forget the hippie colonies up in the mountains. The epicenter of Colorado marijuana production lies in Denver's north-side industrial district straddling I-70, where railroad spurs weave between warehouses, distribution centers and factories. Sharp-eyed visitors will quickly notice the signs of a cannabis facility: cameras over every entrance, hazmat signs and enormous HVAC systems. Avicenna and Green Sativa share a block with another licensed cultivation facility — a ""grow,"" in the crunchy slang that lingers from the underground days — and, according to Behzadzadeh's employees, possibly an unlicensed one, too. Avicenna is named for the Persian scholar who wrote ""The Canon of Medicine"" a thousand years ago. Behzadzadeh grew up in Iran, in a resolutely secular family; even as a boy, he couldn't stomach the fundamentalist clerics brought to power by the Iranian revolution. In 1983, when he was just 15, he left Iran by himself to join an older brother in the United States, arriving with almost no money. Behzadzadeh settled in Rhode Island, where he trained as a pharmacist. After seven years filling prescriptions, he found his way into software consulting and got rich before concluding that encroaching global consultancies would eventually swallow his business. At the time, Colorado was drafting the regulations governing the sale of recreational marijuana. ""I knew that this is a business of compliance before it's anything marijuana,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""I did not have a problem following the rules and regulations in pharmacy, so this would not be that difficult."" State and often local requirements govern every aspect of Colorado's marijuana trade to ensure safety and that no plant is grown or sold outside the licensed system, where it could evade taxation or end up in the hands of people not allowed to have it. Behzadzadeh led me to Avicenna's extraction room, where butane, under high pressure, is used to separate the psychoactive chemicals of cannabis from its leaves; Behzadzadeh, per Denver Fire Department regulations and at great expense, made the room blastproof. Next we stopped at the safe where he's obliged to store the drugs and any cash on hand at day's end. A few feet away, a young woman named Angel wielded a tool resembling a dental pick to pack small plastic vials with a sticky extract called wax, using a state-inspected scale, and a young man applied state-designed product labels onto state-mandated opaque plastic bottles. Other young men — apart from Angel, they were all men — supervised extracts baking in specialized ovens. In Behzadzadeh's office, we could watch all the activity in the building, including ourselves, watching all the activity, from 16 recorded camera feeds on a 50-inch monitor behind his desk. Another monitor over the couch displayed his dispensary 10 miles away in Federal Heights from four perspectives. But for all the regulatory rigor, the flux of cash requires adjustments on the fly that no business with a checkbook, let alone a line of credit, would have to face. That week, for example, Behzadzadeh hoped to parcel out his $22,000 payroll on Thursday. But the satchel was a little light. He had given a contractor $17,000 as a down payment on a new roof for his grow, which he was in the process of expanding. And a concentrates customer found itself short on cash, so Behzadzadeh agreed to split the product with the client and forgo a $7,000 payment. There was money in the safe at the dispensary, but nobody had time to go pick it up. So it was not until Friday morning that Elsberg walked into the office and pulled four thick envelopes from his jacket pocket containing $18,299.13: four days' worth of sales at the dispensary. Each envelope bore the day's total — the money had already been counted at the store, twice — but now Elsberg sat down at Behzadzadeh's big leather chair and pulled the cash out of an envelope. At one point, a loose note fluttered to the floor, blown by the ceiling fan. When Behzadzadeh finally sat down to disburse the payroll, it was after 5 p.m. He lugged a large vase full of change (the ""genie bottle"") over to the couch, retrieved from the satchel 22 thousand-dollar bundles, plus a big stack of small-denomination bills that he'd been collecting all week, and then laid it all on a cushion beside him. The first pay stub showed $932.81. Behzadzadeh took a thousand-dollar stack, peeled off a $100, which went into a new pile, and collected $32 from the small-bill stack. Then he reached into the genie bottle to retrieve the change, folded the stub and put it in an envelope with the cash. Walking out into the Friday twilight, very few of Behzadzadeh's employees probably gave much thought to the wad of cash in their pockets. But everyone in the business can recall one or another infamous crime — clerks forced to open a safe at gunpoint in a dispensary on East Colfax; the murder of a security guard in Aurora — and some spectacular heists have gone largely unreported, as when thieves broke through the roof of one grow and then cut open its safe. For these businesses, robbery poses an existential threat. The money is often gone — insurance to reimburse the loss is, naturally, expensive — replaced, potentially, by new costs for tighter security or tougher regulations or, in the case of a store, by damage to its veneer of safety. All of Behzadzadeh's cameras at Avicenna couldn't have protected his satchel from intruders with guns. ""It would only take one really effective rip-off gang,"" Walsh, the former U.S. attorney, says, ""to terrorize that industry."" Applying for a Safe Harbor checking account is an invasive procedure. The credit union first tries to learn as much as it can about the company and its owners, beginning with an hourlong interview, followed by the document collection that Behzadzadeh found so aggravating: lists of owners, investors, vendors and customers; financial statements and tax forms; the business's organizing documents; state licenses; leases, handbooks and more. The documents can multiply quickly, because marijuana businesses are often a web of affiliated companies with overlapping ownership. Each often gets its own bank account. Once the accounts are opened, Safe Harbor's bankers inspect the business and its premises as frequently as every three months, to confirm that it hews to all of Colorado's rules. Treasury's guidance implies that a bank can't properly make sure that a client stays on the right side of the Cole memo without a rigorous state licensing and regulatory plan in place, according to McVay, the Seattle lawyer. This, he says, explains why California's large medical-marijuana sector mostly lacks access to banking services: Local governments oversee the business, and with a very light touch. The state won't implement comprehensive regulations until later this year at the earliest. Safe Harbor bankers spend most of their time monitoring client transactions, tying every dollar the bank takes in to a legitimate sale and making sure that no dollar withdrawn disappears into the illicit economy. Each month, they reconcile the account activity to a company's ledger and the sales it reports, as well as to all the other information they've gleaned about a client, such as which companies it normally trades with. The credit union has compiled reams of data about how money moves around the marijuana industry, and bankers regularly compare notes about the transactions they see. When an unusual deposit arrives — larger than typical, say, or from a new source — the banker holds the money until the client can account for it. Seefried recalls how a banker noticed that one dispensary seemed to have customers with unusually deep pockets: its sales averaged $300 to $400 each, while medical-marijuana patients generally spend less than $100 at dispensaries. The banker interrogated the client and, from the parking lot, even staked out the dispensary and studied its customers. In the end, still mystified by how the dispensary made its money, Safe Harbor closed the account. ""You cannot bank what you don't understand,"" Seefried says. Safe Harbor has closed three other accounts after members broke various credit-union rules, indicating that they weren't willing to be fully transparent with their bankers. Late last summer, Seefried ejected three more members after bankers, working with money-laundering experts, detected suspicious activity. And another three closed their accounts rather than comply with her increasingly strict requirements, including one that customers deposit 90 percent of their receipts. The rule, she acknowledges, was mainly intended to weed out less-committed clients: Only a business trying to hide its transactions would be put off by it. Last June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado's federal regulator, conducted its annual examination of the credit union's books and practices, and for the third year in a row, had no complaints about Safe Harbor. Today the program consists of 13 people, including five responsible solely for compliance. Most are women. (Women manage more than half of all credit unions.) When Seefried hires bankers for Partner Colorado, she gravitates toward sociable people. For Safe Harbor, she says she prefers introverts or, at the very least, people who evince precision and curiosity. This sort of meticulous banking isn't cheap. For each $100,000 deposited at Safe Harbor, a client pays $450 in fees in the first year and $300 thereafter. (Client companies that serve the marijuana industry but don't actually sell the drugs, like laboratories, require much less vetting and so pay much lower fees.) Seefried says the Safe Harbor program made a modest profit in its first year — less than $200,000. It became much more lucrative for the credit union in 2016, but Seefried won't reveal specifics. According to federal data, most of the institution's sources of income have stayed relatively steady since 2014, but fee income has grown to a projected $5 million in 2017 from nearly $3 million. Seefried says that about three-quarters of Safe Harbor's marijuana-selling clients pay less than $1,000 a month per account, considerably less than they would pay at banks, where monthly account fees are said to start at $1,500. Many observers assume that the opportunity to assess lucrative fees is what entices small banks to take on these risky accounts. Federal data show that at Champion Bank, in suburban Denver, which began explicitly working with marijuana businesses in 2014, annual fee revenue on deposit accounts increased by a factor of 68 from 2013 to 2016, to $752,000 from $11,000, even as its main line of business, providing loans, shrank. At Colorado Bank and Trust in La Junta, fees grew elevenfold to $2.9 million. For marijuana businesses, engaging with the financial mainstream has kept them mostly free from legal trouble. Safe Harbor has received subpoenas for the bank records of only four of the just over 200 clients it has had. None has yet been indicted. John Walsh can recall prosecuting one case against regulated dispensaries and none against a business serving the industry. But working without a checking account makes even an otherwise law-abiding business look evasive, says Lewis Koski, who served as the first director of the state's Marijuana Enforcement Division, which collects marijuana taxes and regulates the industry, before he joined Andrew Freedman in a consulting venture. A cash-management technique like personal deposits structured to evade notice can legally amount to money laundering. ""Banking,"" Koski says, ""just provides a really clear picture of where money is coming in and where money is going out."" On the last Wednesday of last March, Kim Oliver, Partner Colorado's executive vice president, pulled her old, mud-streaked silver Jetta into Avicenna's parking lot. She had come from her ranch, east of Denver. She was dressed formally and seemed intently focused on the business at hand. Seefried had reviewed all of Behzadzadeh's paperwork; now only an inspection stood between him and a bank account. Behzadzadeh gave Oliver a warm welcome, and Elsberg took her ID, signed her in and gave her a visitor badge. Oliver made a mental note: the first small compliance test, passed. Oliver, who is 59, has worked in credit unions all her adult life. Earlier she had confided to me a lifelong hostility to marijuana and rage when she discovered that her son-in-law, a veteran suffering from PTSD and living in her house, was cultivating a small crop in her basement. But working on Safe Harbor had forced her to reconsider her views on medical marijuana. ""I found out that he wasn't blowing smoke,"" she told me. (I couldn't tell if she intended the pun.) ""That was my whole thing: You're just trying to have an excuse to smoke dope."" She now supplies her arthritic mother with topical creams that contain cannabidiol, a chemical compound in the marijuana flower that doesn't produce a high but that medical-marijuana advocates believe reduces inflammation. Oliver sat down with Behzadzadeh and Elsberg at a gray marble table in the kitchenette just inside the employee entrance. She began the formal inspection by going through a checklist: six pages long, scores of questions. The first series delved into Behzadzadeh's financial practices and the second into business procedures. These were meant to assess Behzadzadeh's compliance with state regulations. Then she read five or six questions about each of the eight Cole memo priorities. After a response, Oliver made a check — almost always ""yes"" — and sometimes wrote a little note beside it. ""If you had an employee, and they cut a bud off,"" she asked at one point, ""how would you catch who did that?"" ""Cut a bud off"" — the phrase in Oliver's Great Plains twang was disorienting. One of the incongruities in Colorado's marijuana business is how professionals new to the trade adopt the Mendocino idiom without either irony or any particular reverence, the way their clothes absorb the plant's scent after a few hours on site. The industry's brand-builders prefer more sanitized language when talking to the public: ""adult use"" for ""recreational"" and ""cannabis"" for ""marijuana."" Elsberg replied, ""That's the beauty of it — we have cameras on everything."" The questions, and especially the answers, occasionally delved into minutiae, as when Behzadzadeh noted that he had hired a man to drive the perimeter of his two buildings hourly every night. Oliver raised an eyebrow. ""He's legal,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""I checked his sosh"" — Social Security number. ""I checked his driver's license."" He deadpanned, ""I sent a copy to Jeff Sessions, too."" Next, Oliver went about documenting compliance, snapping photos of the cameras, the safes, the locks on cabinets and other equipment, the bars blocking the windows and even the eyewash station. She walked over to a bakery-bun rack and photographed the RFID tag lying next to a brittle sheet of an extract known as shatter. Then she had an employee type the tag number into the state record system to call up that batch's history. She visited the grow next door (""I'm surprised they have as many cameras that they do,"" she remarked approvingly afterward) and then followed Behzadzadeh and Elsberg up to the dispensary in Federal Heights. The dispensary inspection got off to a rocky start when Oliver noticed the A.T.M. near the entrance. Cash-machine companies often rent them to dispensaries and stores, because so few can accept credit cards, but Behzadzadeh owned his and each week filled it with $2,000 in cash taken from the register. ""That's got to change,"" Oliver said matter-of-factly. ""The biggest way of laundering money is through the A.T.M."" Behzadzadeh's machine was tied to a personal bank account; every time a customer withdrew cash, that account received a credit. But the register money was unaccounted for; it could come from anywhere. Now, Oliver told him, he would have to withdraw money from Safe Harbor and hire an armored car to deliver the cash and fill the A.T.M.; he couldn't even touch it himself. A look of incredulity crossed Behzadzadeh's face. ""Wait — I'm not going to give my business to somebody else!"" he said. As a start-up entrepreneur, Behzadzadeh nursed a swelling grudge against the contractors and vendors who nickeled and dimed him, he thought, at every turn — maybe even Safe Harbor. The cost of banking was one thing, but the prospect of trading the satchel for an armored car from a company like Blue Line, another niche player that charged a premium in a niche industry, especially galled him. ""I have no problem doing business with you guys, and I appreciate the banking, but I'm not going to pay Blue Line to take my money,"" he said, his voice rising. ""There's no way."" Oliver kept pressing. ""All they're doing is loading the machine for you,"" she said. ""If I wanted to be on the black market, I would come in here and fill this machine all the time to clean the money."" ""Ah,"" Behzadzadeh said. Now he understood. He thought out loud: He would bring cash from Avicenna to the dispensary and give it to a courier, who would put different cash, which he had brought with him, into the A.T.M. ""While you're doing that"" — Behzadzadeh addressed the imaginary courier — ""I'll make you coffee."" Behzadzadeh's dogs were barking ferociously when he and his wife returned home from dinner late one night in September. They didn't think anything of it, but several hours later, the couple heard noises in their house. Behzadzadeh gathered his wife and children in a bedroom and raced downstairs with a laser-sighted pistol. But the intruders were gone, along with his cellphone — and the satchel. The robbery could have been a financial disaster. A month earlier, the Denver Fire Department had determined that the extraction room at Avicenna was not sufficiently blastproof, shutting down the factory for two months. ""If they had taken $30,000 or $40,000,"" Behzadzadeh said, ""it would have literally broken my back."" But the satchel held no money that night. Behzadzadeh had opened his bank accounts the morning after the inspection. It had taken him a few months to fully embrace them — Seefried had predicted as much — but now around two-thirds of his trading partners also accept or write checks. What cash remains in Behzadzadeh's business waits in safes, secured to the floor, for the armored truck. Yet despite Safe Harbor's efforts and those of its competitors, bank accounts remain out of reach for many Colorado marijuana companies. The high fees put off smaller businesses at the same time as banks seem to be pulling back. Seefried didn't want Safe Harbor deposits to swamp the credit union, so last January she reduced the number of new monthly clients from five to three and then closed the door altogether in August after deposits ballooned over the summer. As the state Marijuana Enforcement Division granted licenses to about 220 additional companies last year through November, Safe Harbor's waiting list swelled to 96 businesses, or two-and-a-half-years' worth of new clients, before the credit union stopped adding names to it. The five banks have become very stingy about granting new accounts, according to three C.P.A.s who have marijuana-industry clients. The parent company of one of those institutions, Colorado National Bank, declared bankruptcy in November, putting its future as a marijuana banker in doubt. Marijuana banking has always depended entirely on forbearance from Washington, and the Trump administration seems decidedly less tolerant than its predecessor. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions declared before a gathering of law-enforcement officials that marijuana is ""only slightly less awful"" than heroin. ""I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store,"" he said. A task force assembled in February by the Justice Department to combat violent crime didn't recommend any changes to the Cole memo when it delivered its initial findings last summer, but the agency is very likely revising it. (The Justice Department wouldn't comment on its deliberations.) [Update: After this article went to press, the Justice Department rescinded the Cole memo, giving U.S. attorneys more latitude to enforce federal marijuana laws in their districts.] Seefried had hoped to begin making loans to and processing credit-card transactions for Safe Harbor's existing clients, but for the foreseeable future, she has put those plans on hold. Until federal law catches up to public sentiment, marijuana banking is unlikely to keep pace with the industry — the vetting is too expensive. Just last month, after a client was caught up in a police investigation, Safe Harbor had to review the account to make sure bankers hadn't missed any suspicious activity. ""It cost me $30,000: $20,000 to bring in investigators for three days and $10,000 for legal fees,"" Seefried told me. ""That's one client, with one problem."" She plans to raise fees in the next couple months. Yet she still hopes to position Safe Harbor as a model for banking the marijuana industry elsewhere. In November, Safe Harbor began licensing its name and protocols to financial institutions nationwide. Six banks and credit unions in six states will begin taking on customers this month, including a credit union in Colorado to serve the customers that Safe Harbor no longer can. Three more will join each quarter. Safe Harbor is also testing a mobile-phone app for buying marijuana in Hawaii's handful of state-licensed dispensaries. In June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado's regulator, advised Seefried that it would begin examining the institution quarterly rather than yearly, which she attributes to the national expansion. She has hired two full-time employees just to manage the increased compliance. ""We are bringing more credit unions to the table, and they don't want us teaching them incorrectly,"" she says. One industry investment facilitator, the Arcview Group, estimates that legal marijuana sales in the United States will more than double to roughly $21 billion by 2021 from nearly $9 billion last year. Walsh, the former prosecutor, has concluded that the tension between the federal government and liberalizing states is unsustainable. ""I came in as U.S. attorney in 2010 assuming that it was my job to enforce the federal marijuana laws regardless of what state legalization efforts would look like,"" he says. ""The longer I worked on the issue, and we struggled with it, the more I realized that a simple shut-it-down approach was not practical. The notion that you can put this genie back in the bottle today is not realistic."""
Op-Ed,2018-01-04,"On Tuesday, Donald Trump unleashed yet another tweet storm from within his unceasing drought of competence.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/opinion/trump-attention-economy.html,847," On Tuesday, Donald Trump unleashed yet another tweet storm from within his unceasing drought of competence. In a series of 16 tweets, Trump lied, boasted, lashed out, bemoaned, provoked, belittled and prodded. In other words, Trump began this year the way he ended the last one: eroding and reducing the office of the presidency on a daily basis. His most consequential tweet was a boast about destructive power: ""North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the 'Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.' Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!"" Sir, this is not a missile-measuring contest. No one wants to think about the size of your button. You seem to think that the effects of a nuclear strike would be the verification of your virility rather than the loss of innumerable lives. This is not the way you conduct diplomacy. You don't get into a Twitter battle with another world leader. You don't drag America down because you want to pump yourself up. It's not about you! But in Trump's universe, he is the center around which everything and everyone else orbits. He is so addicted to adulation and allergic to even the most legitimate of criticisms that he is rendered emotionally helpless, constantly boxing with shadows and dodging the truth. In his mind, no one is ever fair to him, because for him fairness is being allowed to lie with ease, profit with impunity and defy convention without consequence. This is why we keep seeing these outbursts: A man who built a life and a career flouting the rules is being forced to play by them and may even be punished under them. There is no way to stop the process that is already in progress. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, and his team show up every day working on their investigation and building their cases. We have no idea what they know, but it is clear their search weighs heavily on Trump. This investigation is driving Trump to distraction. No matter how much his attorney tries to assure him that the investigation will end soon and well for him — and no matter how much Trump may believe that — Mueller is in no rush and is no rube. Trump is trapped. He and his minions can lie to the public, but they can't lie to Mueller. Whatever truth there is to find, Mueller will find it. And from what we already know, there seems to have been quite a bit of funny business within the Trump campaign. Even the disheveled, self-important, would-be impresario Steve Bannon won't deny the stench that emanated from Trump Tower during the campaign. According to The Guardian, in Michael Wolff's forthcoming book ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,"" Bannon described the Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a group of Russians during the 2016 election campaign as ""treasonous"" and ""unpatriotic."" Bannon also reportedly told the author, ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" Trump didn't take well to his former disciple's apostasy, saying in a statement: ""Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind."" That's a lie. Steve Bannon had everything to do with Trump and his presidency. Bannon was the brain to Trump's bluster. That is to say not that Bannon was particularly smart but that he was sinisterly manipulative. The same way that Bannon has an almost supersensory ability to divine ways to tie together white supremacy, cultural anxiety, class warfare, xenophobia and government distrust, Trump is supremely aware, on a gut level, that we live in an attention economy. Not only is our influence — and sometimes even our worth — determined by the amount of attention we garner; the amount of attention we have to give — or should I say ""pay"" — is a limited commodity and whoever owns it owns us to some degree, even against our will. So, through it all, and perhaps because of it all, Trump frantically slings spaghetti at the wall, in the hope that some strands will stick and also that the wall itself will become defaced. It is Trump's strategy; it is Trump's ethos. If this were almost any other person, we could simply ignore him and starve the beast of oxygen. But we can't. This person is the president of the most powerful nation on earth. He won, even if aided by the enemy. He lives in the White House. He travels on Air Force One. Trump has America, and indeed the world, in a vise grip. We want to ignore the absurdity of his every utterance, but to do so is on some level a civic and moral abdication. We are adrift in Trump's ocean of idiocy, hoping and praying that Mueller will toss us a lifeline."
News,2018-01-04,"As a Styles editor, I try to keep up with the latest sneaker drops, but it feels as if I am always playing catch-up.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/insider/peak-sneaker-inside-sneaker-con.html,823," As a Styles editor, I try to keep up with the latest sneaker drops, but it feels as if I am always playing catch-up. Sure, trends change in clothing from season to season, but the pace and variety of the sneaker economy is out of the ordinary. And ""keeping them fresh"" is a large part of keeping up. There seems to be a never-ending barrage of new shoes coming out, and it's nearly impossible to walk through downtown Manhattan without passing groups of boys lining up to get them. Yeezy Waverunners! Nike Air Max 97s! OFF-WHITE x Air Jordan 1s! With each drop more pressing than the last, sneaker culture might have hit a peak in 2017. Sneaker Con, a gathering of shoe fanatics founded by Yu Ming Wu, has been taking place for nine years. This year, the organizers moved it to an expanded space at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and expected nearly 20,000 people, a huge increase from the 600 people who attended it the first year. My experience with covering events like this is that, although we can add analysis, reporting and insight into the event, most of the ""kids"" will follow it on Instagram and YouTube, so by Monday morning, it's old news. I wanted to find a new way to cover it that helped non sneaker heads, like myself, get a grasp on the culture. So I thought of the idea to solicit the experts for their various sneaker tips. I pitched it to my editor, Choire Sicha, on Slack. Joanna Nikas 5:31 p.m.: ""Story idea headline .... From the Sneaker Heads at Sneaker Con: Tips on Care, Tricks on Copping and Choosing Their All-Time Favorites."" Choire Sicha 5:32 p.m.: ""omg SOLD."" In hindsight, I didn't know what I was in for (it was my first Sneaker Con). I arrived at the convention center around noon on Saturday, the first day of the event, and the line was already two blocks long. I was wearing a pair of Nike Air Max 90 sneakerboots, which didn't seem to impress anyone. In the brightly lit center, there were nearly 500 official vendors set up spanning almost every inch of the 160,000-square-foot partitioned space. But the heart and soul of the event was the trading pit, an area in the back where a vibrant crowd of mostly teenage boys was talking and holding up sneakers, looking for buyers. ""Who is this guy,"" asked a very confused parent as she pointed to Giancarlo Purchia, known as Blazendary to his 800,000 vlog subscribers. A 17-year-old internet star known for his YouTube commentary on sneakers and streetwear trends, he had set up a step-and-repeat to greet and take photos with his fans. He was wearing a jacket from the coveted Supreme and Louis Vuitton collaboration, a Goyard bag and Nike Mag sneakers, a look that cost over $60,000, he boasted online. Across the space, Benjamin Kickz, a 16-year-old reseller to celebrities like DJ Khaled, was giving tips to kids who had gathered around him to take selfies. ""You go to events like Sneaker Con and make a bunch of connections, and you just text them,"" he said. ""You say: 'Yo, how much is this? How much is this?' You just eventually get all of it."" As a woman, I stuck out like a sore thumb. The event was very male-focused, so my eye was out for female sneaker heads. I came across Ariana Peters, a founder of The Chicks With Kicks, which she started with her sisters after her father handed over his 6,000-pair sneaker collection, assembled over more than 25 years. But she was one of the very few. ""We have not seen another female-run booth,"" she said. ""So you have to break down that barrier. Even when we started our Instagram account, we got comments saying, 'You are girls, you don't know anything about the sneaker world.' We try to make that a point to show up early and be in the front, since it is a first-come, first-served basis, we don't want to get lost in the crowd."" I had been to vintage conventions and fashion week shows, but even the most hyped events lacked the organic energy of this one. From early 1985 Air Jordans to Converse Chuck Taylors to Adidas Superstars, there is a deep-rooted history embedded in sneaker culture that allows people to connect to excellence and their idols, whether they are sports icons like LeBron James or cultural stars like Kanye West. So what did I learn? 1) Store your sneakers in a dark space, because light can cause yellowing, which devalues your shoes. 2) Become friends with people who work at sneaker shops. 3) Always check details like font and stitching when verifying real versus fake sneakers. 4) Ask your elders for their old clothes and sneakers. Chances are they will eventually come back in style. 5) Wash your insoles for, well, obvious reasons."
News,2018-01-04,Good Thursday. (We hope that all U.S.-based readers are staying warm.) Here’s what we’re watching:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/business/dealbook/trump-bannon-wolff-book.html,2945," Good Thursday. (We hope that all U.S.-based readers are staying warm.) Here's what we're watching: • Trump moves to open nearly all offshore waters to drilling. • Topic A in Washington is the lurid picture of the White House in Michael Wolff's new book. • A Justice Department decision on marijuana has whacked shares in one well-known publicly traded company.  • Toshiba has found a buyer for its bankrupt nuclear power business. Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. The energy industry is likely cheering the Trump administration's decision to allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States waters. Many others aren't. From The New York Times: The plan would give the energy industry broad access to drilling rights in most parts of the outer continental shelf, including Pacific waters near California, Atlantic waters near Maine and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The proposal lifts a ban on drilling, imposed by President Barack Obama in his final days in office, that protected more than 100 million offshore acres along the Arctic and Eastern Seaboard. Such a reversal deals a serious blow to Mr. Obama's environmental legacy and signals that the Trump administration is nowhere near done unraveling the environmental restrictions of its predecessor in an effort to promote domestic energy production. The drilling plan comes on the heels of a separate proposal to repeal offshore drilling safety regulations that were put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster, as well as a decision by Congress to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. In a statement, National Ocean Industries Association president Randall Luthi said: ""NOIA welcomes the bold and broad offshore leasing proposal released today by the Department of the Interior."" The new plan will not immediately green-light drilling. Finalizing the plan could take as long as 18 months, the NYT reports, and in the meantime, a number of states are expected to challenge the proposal in an effort to protect their coastlines. This summer Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey sent a letter to the Interior Department, saying the state ""strongly opposes any waters off our coastline being considered for inclusion in this leasing program."" In 2016, New Jersey generated $44 billion from tourism, supporting more than 321,000 jobs, the letter said. Mr. Christie isn't the only governor to oppose the proposal. The Washington Post reports that ""the Democratic governors of North Carolina and Delaware are also opposed. Gov. Rick Scott (R) of Florida, where beach tourism on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts generates nearly $50 billion and a half-million jobs annually, according to a Florida Atlantic University report, said Thursday that he adamantly opposes drilling off the state's coast.""  The WSJ reports that the studio could go for less than $500 million and shareholders may lose all their equity. According to the WSJ, ""the bidders include a group led by businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet; production company Killer Content working with philanthropist Abigail Disney; studio Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.; and investment firms Vine Alternative Investments and Shamrock Capital Investments."" Obviously, it's ""Fire and Fury,"" Michael Wolff's book on the White House. Why? Here's a sample of what Steve Bannon apparently told him, courtesy of the Guardian: Bannon, speaking to author Michael Wolff, warned that the investigation into alleged collusion with the Kremlin will focus on money laundering and predicted: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" And here's an excerpt from CNBC, from what Mr. Wolff says was an email that circulated around the White House in April, purportedly representing the views of Gary Cohn: It's worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns. Trump won't read anything — not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers; nothing. He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored. And his staff is no better. How did Mr. Trump respond? In a statement yesterday, the president said that Mr. Bannon had ""lost his mind."" Lawyers for the president later sent his former adviser a cease-and-desist letter. Caveat: Some of Mr. Wolff's interviewees have accused him of misrepresenting them, in ""Fire and Fury"" and in the past. But Axios says he has tapes this time. The political flyaround • Paul Manafort sued Robert Mueller to limit the scope of the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in last year's presidential election. DealBook's White Collar Crime Prof doesn't rate his chances. (NYT) • Will 2018 be the year that Mr. Trump follows through on his hard-line trade stance and starts imposing tariffs? (NYT) • Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that New York State would challenge the new tax plan in court, and asked the state legislature to add a statewide payroll tax. (NYT) • Mr. Trump shut down a White House commission on voter fraud. (CNN) • The administration must decide on two policy choices this year that could batter the American solar industry. (WaPo) • Would Twitter ever suspend Mr. Trump's account? (NYT) The Dow Jones industrial average broke past 25,000 points for the first time Thursday. Yes, 1,000 point moves aren't what they used to be, but the pace of the rally is still notable. If the blue-chip index closes above 25,000, it will have taken the Dow just 23 trading sessions to go from 24,000 to 25,000. That would be the fastest move from one millennial marker to the next on record, writes the WSJ's Amrith Ramkumar. ""Of course, each 1,000-point milestone gets easier as the index marches higher. The climb from 24000 to 25000 was a 4.2% gain, compared to a 7.1% climb when the Dow hit 15000 in 2013."" A strong rally in technology shares has powered stocks in the new year. The Nasdaq Composite surpassed 7,000 on Tuesday, and both it and the Standard & Poor's 500 index are at record highs. In fact, this might be the best start to a year for the S.&P. 500, writes Instinet's Frank Cappelleri. ""The SPX has logged consecutive gains of least 50 basis points while notching 52-week new highs. That may not sound too outlandish, but according to SentimenTrader, this combination has never happened before. Thus, it equates to the BEST start ever…"" So can the bull market keep going? David Tepper of Appaloosa Management thinks so. Mr. Tepper said on CNBC: ""Explain to me where this market is rich? It's not rich with the tax thing that just changed earnings projections. With earnings forecasts going up and interest rates where they are, how is this market expensive? I don't see the overvaluation. World growth is higher."" We're believers that correlation does not necessarily prove cause causation, but ... maybe it has something to do with this, via the AP: Attorney General Jeff Sessions is rescinding the Obama-era policy that had paved the way for legalized marijuana to flourish in states across the country, two people with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press. Sessions will instead let federal prosecutors where pot is legal decide how aggressively to enforce federal marijuana law, the people said. As the AP notes, the move will make it more difficult for people to figure out whether it is legal to grow or consume marijuana. As for Scotts: The company has become a publicly traded proxy for the business of marijuana growing, with its C.E.O. having openly courted the pot industry. Political backlash: It's coming from Republicans as well. Take Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado: — Michael J. de la Merced A number of cannabis stocks tumbled on the news that Mr. Sessions is rescinding the Obama-era policy, reports MarketWatch's Ciara Linnane. Nevada-based Cannabis Sativa and Colorado-based cannabis farmer GrowGeneration are both down more than 20 percent. Even cannabis companies based in Canada, which is preparing to legalize marijuana later this year, are taking a hit. Toronto-based medical marijuana distributor Supreme Cannabis Co. and its Ontario-based rival Canopy Growth are both off more than 12 percent. Vancouver-based medical marijuana company Aurora Cannabis is down nearly 11 percent. The context: Shares of cannabis companies had rallied this week on the start of recreational marijuana sales in California. Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF, the largest marijuana-focused exchange-traded fund, ended Wednesday up 23 percent this year, after surging 74 percent in 2017. It's down nearly 9 percent Thursday. Toshiba agreed today to sell its Westinghouse Electric unit to Brookfield Business Partners for $4.6 billion, finally separating itself from its troubled nuclear division. The terms: Brookfield's offer comprises approximately $1 billion in equity, $3 billion in debt financing and the rest by assuming obligations like pensions and environmental charges. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30, pending approval by the Delaware federal bankruptcy court. The context: Westinghouse's troubles — including delays and cost overruns at two U.S. nuclear plant projects — led to the business filing for bankruptcy last year. That has been one of the biggest drags on Toshiba, saddling the Japanese company with $6 billion in write-offs and the sale of its prized chip business to help keep the conglomerate afloat. Tara Lachapelle of Gadfly adds this as well: — Michael J. de la Merced As the music streaming giant moves toward a public market listing — it confidentially filed paperwork last month — Wall Street and Silicon Valley are waiting to see if other privately held tech giants also eschew the traditional I.P.O. process and just flip their shares onto a stock market. From Ben Sisario and Michael in the NYT: Deal makers and analysts have said a direct listing is available to Spotify because of its already wide name recognition among potential investors, which makes the standard I.P.O. meet-and-greets largely unnecessary. Uber, Airbnb and a few other giant start-ups also have readily recognizable brands and little need for the money raised in a standard I.P.O. process. If they follow suit, investment banks might stand to lose out on big fees — though it's worth noting that Spotify has retained several firms as advisers. Depends who you ask. Security experts say that both Meltdown (which affects virtually every Intel processor) and Spectre (which afflicts most other processors) have big costs. From Cade Metz and Nicole Perlroth of the NYT: The two problems could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of a computer. There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent — an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services. Companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft have started working on updates. And chip makers may have to eventually swap out all affected hardware. Investors have already shown concern about the effects: • Shares in Intel fell 3.4 percent yesterday. (The chip giant played down the problem.) • Shares in AMD jumped 5.2 percent. • Shares in Nvidia leapt 6.6 percent. Intel's chief executive, Brian Krzanich, sold off a large chunk of his stake in the company after the chip maker had been made aware of the security flaws. An Intel spokeswoman told MarketWatch the sale was unrelated to Meltdown and Spectre. The tech flyaround • Expect smarter cars and digital assistants this year, Brian Chen writes in his C.E.S. preview. (NYT) • Technology means 2018 will be more chaotic, as our interconnected world amplifies butterfly effects, Farhad Manjoo predicts. (NYT) The new law does away with corporate tax deductions for performance-based pay — like the huge stock-based packages C.E.O.s have enjoyed since the 1990s. Here's what Sarah Anderson of the social justice think tank Institute for Policy Studies told Renae Merle of the WaPo: ""We would like to think this would result for an overall decline in compensation that it could inject some rationality."" The dissenting view Skeptics think that the law will simply prompt companies to increase executives' base salaries. Let's use Ted Sarandos of Netflix as an example: 2017: $1 million salary, $9 million bonus target 2018: $12 million salary The tax flyaround • Bank of America Merrill Lynch thinks the new tax code will boost corporate profits this year, but create headwinds later. (NYT) • The overhaul includes help for craft breweries, but critics say that the biggest alcohol companies will enjoy the biggest benefit. (WaPo) Countries like Russia and Venezuela are drawn to the lack of central authority — particularly U.S. authority — inherent in Bitcoin and other digital money systems. But their own currency experiments may not work out quite as they hope, according to Nathaniel Popper, Oleg Matsnev and Ana Vanessa Herrero of the NYT: That's because Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are decentralized systems with no one in charge, while the Russian and Venezuelan plans would give the leaders of both countries a measure of control over the new currencies. That runs counter to some of the most basic concepts of virtual currency. Where Bitcoin is still a no-go zone: Merrill Lynch, which has blocked clients and financial advisers from investing in the currency or in related financial instruments. What people are missing about Bitcoin: Glenn Hutchins, the co-founder of Silver Lake, told the FT that while he has invested about $5 million from his family office on companies working with virtual currency, he has yet to buy a Bitcoin. ""Bitcoin could turn out to be the winner; it also could turn out to be Betamax,"" he said. Its shares fell 2 percent in after-hours trading yesterday. Here's why: In July, Elon Musk predicted that Tesla could build 20,000 Model 3s by December. In September, analysts projected that Tesla would deliver 15,900 Model 3s in the fourth quarter. Yesterday, with the analysts in FactSet's compilation of estimates still expecting 4,100 Model 3s in the quarter, Tesla announced that it had delivered 1,550. What Tesla says: ""During Q4, we made major progress addressing Model 3 production bottlenecks, with our production rate increasing significantly towards the end of the quarter."" What a critic says: ""The premise of the stock's sky-high valuation has long been of Tesla eventually dominating the auto industry. That notion has hardly ever seemed more fanciful,"" writes Charley Grant of Heard on the Street. The Times's chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott, discussed the year in Hollywood and Mr. Scott had a suggestion: The movie business might start by designating a pool of money — maybe equivalent to the value of the Miramax and Weinstein Company libraries, and the budgets of every Brett Ratner film and some fraction of Pixar's worldwide revenues — to fund movies written and directed by women. And Meryl Streep responded to comments about her lack of comments on the Weinstein accusations in an interview with Cara Buckley of the NYT: ""I don't want to hear about the silence of me. I want to hear about the silence of Melania Trump. I want to hear from her. She has so much that's valuable to say. And so does Ivanka. I want her to speak now."" • The White House named Geoffrey Berman, Rudy Giuliani's law partner, as the interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

The Dow, which broke though the 25,000 barrier shortly after trading opened in the morning, ended the day 152 points higher, at 25, 075.13, a gain of 0.6 percent. The other major stock indexes also gained. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a much broader index, closed at 2,723.99, a gain of 10.93 points or 0.4 percent. The Nasdaq composite rose 12.38 to 7,077.91, a gain of 0.2 percent. The Dow's climb continues an ascent that began in early 2016. Other major indexes have also reached all-time highs in recent days, including the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite. Underpinning much of the growth is a belief that corporate America will enjoy economic tailwinds in 2018, including benefits from the recently passed Republican tax overhaul. In the December round of economic projections, the median forecast of Federal Reserve officials was that the United States economy would grow 2.5 percent this year, up from a previous estimate of 2.1 percent.

News,2018-01-04,WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday proposed sweeping new rules that could make it easier for small businesses to band together and create health insurance plans that would be exempt from many of the consumer protections mandated by the Affordable Care Act.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-association-health-plans-obamacare.html,1200," WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday proposed sweeping new rules that could make it easier for small businesses to band together and create health insurance plans that would be exempt from many of the consumer protections mandated by the Affordable Care Act. As many as 11 million Americans ""could find coverage under this proposal,"" the Labor Department said in issuing the proposed rules, which carry out an executive order signed by President Trump on Oct. 12. The public will have 60 days to comment on the proposal before the Trump administration adopts final rules with the force of law. The proposal would allow small business owners, their employees, sole proprietors and other self-employed people to join together as a single group to buy insurance in the large-group market. The new health plans could be exempt from some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. They would, for example, not have to provide certain ""essential health benefits"" like mental health care, emergency services, maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs. ""By joining together,"" the Labor Department said, ""employers may reduce administrative costs through economies of scale, strengthen their bargaining position to obtain more favorable deals, enhance their ability to self-insure and offer a wider array of insurance options."" But consumer groups, state officials and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans have strenuously opposed similar ideas for years. Association health plans, they say, will tend to attract employers with younger, healthier workers, leaving behind sicker people in more comprehensive, more expensive plans that fully comply with the Affordable Care Act. That could drive up premiums, which already have risen steadily as Republicans have taken aim at President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement. ""Those with serious health conditions like cancer would be left paying ever-increasing premiums for comprehensive coverage,"" said Chris Hansen, the president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. ""The rule proposed today will almost certainly result in more people facing financial distress when an unexpected health crisis happens."" Similar health plans have a history of fraud and abuse that have left employers and employees with hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid medical bills. Marc I. Machiz, who investigated insurance fraud as a Labor Department lawyer for more than 20 years, said the proposed rules were an invitation to more scams. ""Any idiot with a word processor can create an association in 10 minutes and market it to small employers and individuals who certify that they are self-employed,"" Mr. Machiz said. ""The employers and individuals will pay premiums. By the time they discover they've been sold a fraudulent product, the promoter will be on his way to the Caribbean."" But two influential trade groups that could potentially sponsor the new health plans, the National Restaurant Association and the National Retail Federation, welcomed the proposed rules. The proposal deals another blow to the Affordable Care Act just two weeks after Mr. Trump signed tax legislation that will eliminate penalties for people who go without health insurance. Republicans in Congress have been trying for two decades to promote association health plans through legislation. The House passed a bill that included such plans in 1998, but it died in the Senate. President George W. Bush proposed them in 2003 and 2004. The House passed a bill to encourage them last March. And Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has championed a similar bill in the Senate. Now the Trump administration says it will use its regulatory authority to accomplish what Congress could not. The proposal offers a new interpretation of ""employer"" and other terms in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the framework for employer-sponsored health plans covering tens of millions of Americans. Mr. Trump had ordered the Labor Department to develop the rules as a way to provide insurance options for consumers and small businesses that he said would cost less because they would be ""exempt from the onerous and expensive insurance mandates"" in the 2010 health law. Mr. Paul praised the rules, saying they would ""allow more Americans to join in groups to purchase lower-cost health insurance across state lines."" In response to critics, the Trump administration said that its proposal included some protections for consumers: ""Small business health plans (association health plans) cannot charge individuals higher premiums based on health factors or refuse to admit employees to a plan because of health factors,"" such as a physical or mental illness, disability, claims history or genetic information. The rules would expand the types of groups that could form association health plans and would allow for membership across state lines. Employers around the country could, for example, band together if they were in ""the same trade, industry, line of business or profession"" but had no other connections to one another. Likewise, employers in the same state, region or metropolitan area could form a group health plan. For many years, the department has required a much greater ""commonality of interest"" among small businesses that wanted to be treated as a large group when buying insurance. To qualify under current rules, small businesses generally must have some purpose and relationship ""unrelated to the provision of benefits."" William G. Schiffbauer, a lawyer who specializes in insurance and employee benefits, said Thursday that the rules would ""overturn years of advisory opinions from the Labor Department."" If the agency adopts this proposal as a final rule, he said, ""it will very likely be challenged in the federal courts, delaying implementation"" and shifting attention back to Congress. The department said its new interpretation of the 1974 law, known as Erisa, was justified by ""the need to expand access to health care"" and respond to ""changing market dynamics."" The rules would make new insurance options available to ""the millions of uninsured Americans who are sole proprietors or the family of sole proprietors,"" the department said. When he signed the executive order in October, Mr. Trump said the rules would provide millions of Americans with relief from ""the disaster of Obamacare."" In addition, the Labor Department said Thursday, association health plans could give small businesses relief from some state insurance rules that restrict ""product offerings and pricing."" Under the rules, association health plans could buy commercial insurance or serve as their own insurers, paying claims directly from the plan's assets. Some people who now obtain coverage in the Affordable Care Act marketplace could instead join association health plans. In an interview last week with The New York Times, Mr. Trump suggested that the new policy had been put into effect, but that is not the case. ""We've created associations, millions of people are joining associations,"" he said in the interview. ""Millions. That were formerly in Obamacare or didn't have insurance. Or didn't have health care. Millions of people."" The department acknowledged that association health plans had a history of financial mismanagement and abuse. Some plans, it said, ""have failed to pay promised health benefits to sick and injured workers while diverting, to the pockets of fraudsters, employer and employee contributions from their intended purpose of funding benefits."" The department said it now had the authority to prevent such abuses. But former employees said the department's enforcement apparatus had been weakened by budget cuts and could not adequately police compliance."
News,2018-01-04,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Thursday it would allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States coastal waters, giving energy companies access to leases off California for the first time in decades and opening more than a billion acres in the Arctic and along the Eastern Seaboard.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/climate/trump-offshore-drilling.html,1189," WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Thursday it would allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States coastal waters, giving energy companies access to leases off California for the first time in decades and opening more than a billion acres in the Arctic and along the Eastern Seaboard. The proposal lifts a ban on such drilling imposed by President Barack Obama near the end of his term and would deal a serious blow to his environmental legacy. It would also signal that the Trump administration is not done unraveling environmental restrictions in an effort to promote energy production. While the plan puts the administration squarely on the side of the energy industry and against environmental groups, it also puts the White House at odds with a number of coastal states that oppose offshore drilling. Some of those states are led by Republicans, like Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, where the tourism industry was hit hard by the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in 2010 that killed 11 people and spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Governor Scott vowed on Thursday to protect his state's coast from drilling, saying he would raise the issue with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. ""I have asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration,"" he said in a statement. ""My top priority is to ensure that Florida's natural resources are protected."" The governors of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, California, Oregon and Washington have all opposed offshore drilling plans. Virginia's governor-elect, Ralph S. Northam, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday that expanding drilling would jeopardize his state's tourism and fishing industries, as well as military installations. Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, also a Democrat, called drilling a ""critical threat"" to his state's economy. Mr. Zinke said the drilling plan was part of ""a new path for energy dominance in America,"" but said he planned to speak with Governor Scott and other state leaders before the proposal was finalized. ""It's not going to be done overnight,"" he said. Oil industry leaders cheered the reversal, calling it long overdue. ""I think the default should be that all of our offshore areas should be available,"" said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance. ""These are our lands. They're taxpayer-owned and they should be made available."" The Obama administration blocked drilling on about 94 percent of the outer continental shelf, the submerged offshore area between state coastal waters and the deep ocean. Mr. Zinke charged that those restrictions had cost the United States billions of dollars in lost revenue and said the new proposal would make about 90 percent of those waters available for leasing. The Interior Department would open 25 of 26 regions of the outer continental shelf, leaving only the North Aleutian Basin — which President George Bush protected in an executive order — exempted from drilling. Interior officials said they intended to hold 47 lease sales between 2019 and 2024, including 19 off the coast of Alaska and 12 in the Gulf of Mexico. Seven areas offered for new drilling would be in Pacific waters off California, where drilling has been off limits since a 1969 oil spill near Santa Barbara. President Trump signed an executive order in April requiring the Interior Department to reconsider Mr. Obama's five-year offshore drilling plan, which had invoked an obscure provision of a 1953 law, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, to block new lease sales in large areas of the Arctic and Atlantic. The ban ""deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth,"" Mr. Trump said at the time. Finalizing the new plan could take as long as 18 months, experts said, and in the meantime challenges are expected in the courts and in Congress. In a joint statement, 64 environmental groups called the plan a ""shameful giveaway"" to oil companies. Many said they were exploring legal options. Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, vowed to pursue ""all legislative tools"" to block drilling off the East Coast, including the Congressional Review Act, which allows agency actions to be undone by Congress. Xavier Becerra, California's attorney general, said the state is ""evaluating all of our options"" to protect its coast. And, several groups warned, a future Democratic administration could again redraw the boundaries of allowable drilling. But for now, Republicans' efforts to roll back restrictions on energy production are winning the day. Last month Congress opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, to oil and gas drilling as part of the tax overhaul. And last week the Interior Department rescinded an Obama-era rule that would have added regulations for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, on federal and tribal lands. It also repealed offshore drilling safety regulations that were put in place after the Deepwater Horizon spill. We know. Global warming is daunting. So here's a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. Jody Freeman, director of the environmental law program at Harvard Law School and a former Obama climate adviser, said the latest Trump proposal was more about sending a message. In the Arctic in particular, she said, low oil prices and the decision by Royal Dutch Shell to give up all but one of its federal oil leases indicate drilling is not on the near horizon. ""But the decision is a signal, just like the one Congress sent with ANWR, that Republicans want to open the nation's public lands and waters for business,"" she said. Frank Knapp, president of the Business Alliance for Protecting the Atlantic Coast, said thousands of small businesses, from restaurants to hotels to commercial fishing operations, oppose drilling off their states' waters. ""It's not consistent with our vibrant tourism, fishing and recreation,"" Mr. Knapp said. ""Their concern is their livelihood, the local economies. We all saw what happened to the Gulf Coast with Deepwater Horizon."" Of particular interest to oil companies — and concern to many Florida lawmakers — will be the decision to open the eastern Gulf of Mexico, said Kevin Book, an energy consultant and managing director of ClearView Energy Partners. He noted the area is attractive to the energy industry because there is already a large amount of infrastructure in the region. ""You can talk about the Atlantic all you want, but you're 10 years, 15 years from production,"" Mr. Book said. Analysts said the oil industry was unlikely to rush headlong into new areas. While oil companies have eyed regions like the East Coast for years, oil and gas operators are still smarting from the steep fall in oil prices that began in 2014 because of a global oil glut, which has only recently eased. Despite the recent sharp rise in prices to about $68 a barrel for Brent crude, companies remain wary of spending, particularly in areas where the amount of oil and gas present is unknown and production is likely to be expensive without existing pipelines and other infrastructure. ""It is going to be a really long story,"" said William Turner, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie in Houston. ""It is not going to be gangbusters."""
News,2018-01-04,"Happy New Year, and welcome back — even if for many the first week of school has been disrupted by what some meteorologists classified as a “bomb cyclone.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/learning/shopping-bravery-conspiracy-theories-and-robots-our-favorite-student-comments-this-week.html,10053," Happy New Year, and welcome back — even if for many the first week of school has been disrupted by what some meteorologists classified as a ""bomb cyclone."" As always, we were informed, impressed and entertained by student comments on our writing prompts from around the country and the globe, but this week we want to especially acknowledge the students of Danvers High School in Massachusetts and Hanover Horton High School in Michigan for their excellent contributions. Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear just as they were originally submitted. Our most popular writing prompt over the last two weeks was ""Could You Stop Shopping for an Entire Year?"" Many students thought that would be impossible. Christian HHHS from Hanover Horton loves buying — for himself and others — way too much: I couldn't stop shopping for the rest of the year. The reason why I couldn't stop is because I love buying new stuff for my family and I. I like to get new clothes quite often because I get sick of wearing the same stuff and I want to mix it up a little but I wouldn't be able to do that if I stopped shopping. I also like buying new video games for my PlayStation and new equipment for baseball. I couldn't buy anything for my family for Christmas which wouldn't feel right because I buy them gifts every year. So no, I couldn't stop shopping for the rest of the year. Mary Keohan from Duxbury, Mass., says fashion is her form of self-expression: Yes, it is easy to say most teenage girls are ""obsessed with clothes!"" but clothing has always meant more to than just the excitement of purchasing something new and fun. Clothing ever since I was a little girl has been the best way for me to express myself. If suddenly I couldn't express in which the form of art I believe is fashion is in my life. I would lose my identity. Fashion is what I want to do for the rest of my life in one way or another I am determined to make a living out how I express myself every single day. Minimising other clutter in my life like cutting back on buying unnecessary items like nail polish. Or another perfume when I already have twenty is something I would be more lenient to give up for a year. It's actually something I have been trying to do more of in the past six months, and I've got to say I enjoy the way I feel mentally after doing so. Polaris Hall from Danvers High School, Mass., would find not being able to buy gifts intolerable: I think that everyone could benefit from something like this. Everyone's different, but I know that I spend more money than necessary - especially on my friends. I frequently shop for little things to give as gifts when I could honestly just spend more time with the person and show my love that way instead, but when I see something that reminds me of a loved one I want to get it! My brain gets excited and starts cheering ""that's something my friend likes!"" and ""if I get it for her she'll know I was thinking of her!"" or ""that would make him so happy!"" While I love getting new things for myself as well, giving up shopping would be immensely hard for me because I want more than anything to surround the people I care about with things that are beautiful and make them happy. But Morgan B., also from Massachusetts, thought not shopping for a year could be a helpful exercise: I believe that ""need"" is one of the most incorrectly used words in society today. There are many things that we can live without, but our minds trick us into believing that we need them when most of the time we just want it. I believe Ms. Patchett's chapstick example refers to how society has become blind and lazy to the opportunities that we have. We take advantage of the fact that we can have five chapsticks and if we can't find it or don't like the one of many that we have, we can just go out and buy a new one. Sometimes all we need to do is take some extra time and simplify our lives so that we can focus on other more important things happening in our lives. While not shopping for a year would be hard I believe that I would learn a lot about myself and I would be more aware of the world around me. Anthe Dalkouras from Danvers made a connection to a short story that helped her better understand the difference between ""needs"" and ""wants"": This question reminded me of a story that my classmates and I read in English class called ""Needs"" by Thomas Sowell. Sowell highlights that these ""needs"" are truly just wants and we could essentially live without them. This connects to Ms. Patchett's story because it made me realize all of the unnecessary items I have in my room that I believed I was in dire need of when I bought them, like new a shirt or shoes. All of these things are just wants in life that do not help me survive. This seems like an interesting challenge for me to take part in because it would help me uncover all of the things that I have in my house that I have forgotten about and realize that I never needed them. Judy HHHS from Michigan has found other ways to practice self-control: I understand where she is coming from, wanting to no longer take things for granted and save money but I also don't believe it's a sin to want things or to buy things that aren't necessary. I believe it's possible to find a way to have self control without limiting yourself to never spending money outside of groceries. For me, the most difficult aspect would be not buying trinkets, things that I definitely don't need but I think are super cool. The only thing I have given up for a certain period of time would have to do with food, I give up most candy, ice cream, and sweets when I'm ""in season"" during sports. This worked well for me, and I learned that not eating junk food in excess all the time makes it that much better when you do. Edwyn HHHS from School agreed: You earn all that money, most of it goes to things you need anyway. Why not indulge yourself in your wants every once in awhile. This is coming from someone who still has money from his summer job. It isn't difficult to save up money and use it on what you want to later. Just learn patience. And if you really wanted to give to the poor then save and give to the poor. Having money and doing nothing with it seems like a waste. ZachL. HHHS from Hanover realized that he's already been taking Ms. Patchett's advice for years: After reading the article, I completely agree with Ms. Patchett. My parents have taught me the skills to know whats wanted and needed and to use everything you already have instead of just going out and buying more. My parents have taught me to be smart with my money and to not buy things I don't need, especially if I already have them. I really only go out and buy new things if I need them. I buy toothpaste when its completely gone, I buy gas when I need it and I buy clothes when mine get ripped out or stained. I pretty much have been doing what Mr. Patcheet has done for my whole life. _________ Our popular prompt ""Are You Hopeful About the Future?"" brought in a mix of positive and negative answers. Below are a few we especially liked. ZachL. from HHHS Hanover said one person can make a difference: To deal with turmoil for me, I do many things. Kindness is one way. Donating or buying gifts for others has always made me a happier person. Global issuing around the world should be resolved in helping. Everyone in the world pitching in. Of course, not forcing anyone to, but just out of pure kindness. Donating money or helping clean up something like the oil spill that happened in 2010. The line that stands out to me most in the article is ""we all want to live a happy life."" This stands out to me because it is true, but many people are not doing anything to make other people's lives better, or even their own. Judy HHHS from Michigan found the article inspirational: I believe everyone can have an impact on the world in a positive way. Even if one kind act makes an impact on the life of another, that impact can be felt by other people for generations to come. The idea of a compassionate kindness and empathy is one that resonates with me in a very personal way. From a young age it has been instilled upon me that having empathy and compassion for others is very important, it is important to attempt to understand others and what they are going through. Being kind is important because you never know what can happen next, and therefore you should live your life treating others as you wish to be treated. I think that these ideas should be applied to global issues. Through dialogue and diplomacy we can save more lives and learn to understand other countries and what they are going through. I greatly enjoyed reading this article. It was inspirational in a lot of ways and I agree with a lot of the ideas presented that agreed with kindness and compassion. Javier from HHHS Michigan has hope, and goals for the future: I am very hopeful for the future. In fact, I am much more hopeful of the future that I am of the present. Even though I do not enjoy school there is something that I need from it, and that thing is a high school diploma. I would like to enlist into the Marine Corps, but to enlist in any branch you require a high school diploma. That is understandable, the military doesn't have the time to mess around with stupid people. The future however unpredictable can be conquered with just a little bit of planning. With planning it is easy to deal with the future. However, ""Man plans, and God laughs."" Even if something goes wrong stick with the plan, just work it through. Make the future yours. Emily Mcgovern from Massachusetts believes our actions are cumulative: Many people are excited to grow up and do these crazy things that you don't think you can do as a teen. But that isn't really true, you should strive for your dreams everyday cause you never know what might happen . Something crazy can happen if you put the time and effort you need to be successful . I can wait for the future cause all the things i do that are amazing may all gather up when i am older and can make a huge difference _________ We asked students, ""How Young Is Too Young to Use Social Media?"" and received passionate responses, most grounded in personal experience.  Aubrey Ella Hyldahl from Wilmington, N.C., believes that any age was ""too young"" for social media: In world where social media is integrated so deeply inside our everyday culture, I am not naive enough to think that there is anyway to stop kids from being exposed to it at earlier and earlier ages. I firmly believe that social media gives a warped view of life- one of perfect lighting, makeup, and vacations- that can lead to body image issues and feelings of inferiority. It also contains multiple safety issues such as cyber-bullying and traps and posers. So how young is too young? I think we are all too young. I don't think anybody can scroll through everybody's seemingly perfect lives day in and day out and never feel bad about about their own life. And I am sure if there are people like that out there, that they are the ones resisting the trend and living a social media free life. It breaks my heart to think of ten year olds having their childhood cut short because of social media. Let kids be kids. Encourage them to make real-life friends. To be a good person with strong values and confidence. To play outside. To not get caught up in what others think of them. To thrive. Noah HHHS from Michigan thought young children should stay off social media altogether: In my opinion a person should at least be thirteen before getting some sort of social media account. By using social media at a younger age kids may grow up to be less sociable and probably less likely to connect with others. I really only have two friends that I feel I can discuss personal issues with for example. On the other hand this does teach children how to use social media at younger age, and more likely with parent supervision. Based on my experience with Facebook, it by far has a much more negative impact on kids than it can a positive one. I personally would not trust Facebook with a child's private information, or anyone's private information. However a child is much more vulnerable because they probably are not well equipped to understand what privacy is at their age. Judy HHHS from Michigan also thought apps like Facebook's Messenger Kids would only do more harm than good: I think any age under twelve is too young to use social media. When I was younger I spent a lot of time outside, playing with my friends, and just being a kid. I had a lot of experiences that I wouldn't have had if I had spent all those days inside on a phone or another electronic device. The benefits of introducing technology at a younger age contribute to easily accessible information, being able to research things and use technology to benefit your education. I don't think it interferes with family life but I think it could interfere in a child's relationships with their friends, forcing them into more screen time than real contact with real people in the real world. Jessica Pelletier from Massachusetts suggested parents could protect younger users by setting limits: Children should be limited as to how much time they use social media and what sites they are going to. Parents should set limits on both. If parents do this then it can help children connect with others safely. Facebook's Messenger Kid seems like it is a safe app however that still does not address how much time kids are spending using it. Again, another area where parents have to maintain parental controls on such things like time limits. Facebook is using this app to bring in a younger audience which could get them hooked at a much younger age, and for a lot more years to come. For this reason I believe Facebook is acting in its own best interest. Madison Capezzuto from Danvers, Mass., saw from personal experience how effective these limits could be: Being a typical teenager, I have accounts for many social media websites and tend to be on them for most of the day, effecting the different interactions I have with many different people. I can embarrassingly say that I am a part of this social media epidemic. Scrolling through my Instagram feed, I see kids as young as ten actively using the website unaware of the potential dangers these platforms can cause to someone at that age. The ongoing joke with kids on social media is the simple question, ""Where are your parents?"" Although this comment is comical, it has a lot of truth behind it. My parents didn't even allow me to have an Instagram account until I was 13, even after I got it my mom had my password so that she was able to access it. At the time I found it to be a violation of my privacy as I was unaware of all the negatives that come with social media. Now older and in full control of my accounts, I have come to realize that social media with children can be dangerous as there are many people in the world that unfortunately get caught up in the hate. Zach H HHHS from Hanover Horton gave an anecdote to highlight the benefits a social media account could provide children: About a year ago, my sister and her ""incredibly creepy online friend"" were planning to meet in Florida to attend a event they both desperately wanted to go. My father went with my sister to the event and also to see her ""incredibly creepy online friend."" Well, her ""incredibly creepy online friend"" turned out not to be a ""incredibly creepy online friend"" and instead became my sister's best friend who like the same things and around the same age. Social Media is a great platform to use. It can connect people around the world and give a broader sense of our world a new outlook on how we communicate to each other. But, a child needs to communicate outside of a phone screen. More awkward conversations during the holiday seasons are becoming more and more common as grandparents attempt to spark up a conversation only to get a three or four word response. Also, as my sister ended up meeting her new friend, some aren't as lucky. Their are those ""incredibly creepy online friends"" we have out in the world and it's important for the child and the parent to keep in touch of who they talk to online and what they are discussing. I also believe that being thirteen or over should be the recommended time to get a social media account. And Hannah Kelsey from Massachusetts admitted the internet could be a scary place: When I was an elementary age kid, social media did not completely rule our society in the way that it does now. Facebook had just reached worldwide popularity by the time I was already ""old enough"" to use it, but for children right now that is not the case. My 6 year old cousin is constantly using her ipod touch and is always watching internet videos or playing online games. She even uses Snapchat—of course she has restrictions and only is friends with me and another cousin on Snapchat—but I still wonder: is she too young? On the one hand she is not doing anything wrong or anything inappropriate, but social media can be a very scary place. It is often filled with hate, cyber bullying, racist, sexist, or homophobic posts, and sometimes is even the place of sexual harassment. Are these all things that parents would want their children exposed to? Maybe there is no right or wrong age to start using social media. Maybe the more important thing is that all kids are taught how to be safe online from a very young age. The world is consumed by social media and nearly everyone uses it in some shape or form, children included, so instead of setting up restrictions, kids should learn how to be smart and safe on social media. _________ Our Student Opinion prompt, ""Do You Believe in Online Conspiracy Theories?"" resulted in some interesting, and entertaining, student thoughts. Here are our favorites: Payton James from Massachusetts worries conspiracy theories create paranoia: As much as I'd like to deny it, some internet conspiracies have made me question my entire existence. The one that genuinely makes sense to me is the butterfly effect. This theory explains how small things being altered in the past can change how we're living right now. It poses a ""what if"" question. What if my dad stayed in Connecticut instead of moving here at a young age? They wouldn't have ever met or even have known of each other's existence. Therefore, I wouldn't be here right now. Myself and many other people likely become invested with conspiracy theories because they give complex things an answer, despite the fact that it may not be completely accurate. It's human nature to love organization, and conspiracies fill the gaps of confusion with absurd answers, but an answer is an answer. Hearing all of these outrageous theories has made being paranoid impossible almost. There's nothing I can do about the fact that aliens are coming down from space and messing with us. I cannot change the fact that the entire Kardashian family is possibly involved with the Illuminati. These theories simply make me question things. Meghan Miraglia from Massachusetts acknowledges conspiracy theories offer answers, albeit wrong ones: I don't believe in any online conspiracy theories, yet, the amount of times I have found myself falling into a Wikipedia rabbit hole, clicking on dozens of little blue hyperlinks, is rather concerning. For a week, my heart was galloping around in my ribcage, following things so ridiculous that they just might be true.We like conspiracy theories because they offer answers - albeit, some outrageous ones. But, they are answers nonetheless. Conspiracy theories are a shot in the dark, a fingers-crossed guess where humanity finds itself pouring over their screens watching Shane Dawson provide another possibility about the thing that eats up their thoughts. But, as for the argument that the internet has stirred up more paranoia, well, that's just absolutely false. Paranoia and anxiety has gnawed up the human world for ages. Even before the internet, there were worries. The Internet simply provides a place to pour out all of the nausea, fear, and jitters - a place where minds that fly in a million different directions can intertwine with other minds that fly in a million other directions. Conspiracies unite people.Conspiracies have made me more paranoid. They make me wary, untrusting, and frankly, a little nauseous. The Internet hasn't created those feelings in me, though. The Internet has only highlighted them and brought them out of the shadows. Hee Yun Chung from California is bothered for several reasons: Whenever I scope around the political side of the internet, I always see conspiracy theories that often challenge my faith in humanity. Some examples of online conspiracy theories would be the flat-earthers and the entire InfoWars website. The theories presented by these kinds of people can be dangerous when information can be passed around the world in minutes through the internet. If a large portion of the population were to believe in false theories put forward by incredible people, social order can be put in jeopardy by a single lie. I think people should use the internet with skepticism to whatever they see. If someone sees a story online, they should do research before jumping to conclusions. I think that most people make conspiracy theories in order to make a profit. One example would be Alex Jones' InfoWars. Alex Jones goes onto his show and rails against the globalists while accusing the government/Illuminati (or someone) by making frogs gay through tap water. However, during his shows, he constantly advertises his own products as the only way to protect yourself from an apocalypse that is not coming. Jiwoo Song from California wonders how conspiracy theorists live with the day-to-day fear: To be fair, I would love to live in a world where lizard people are real, Obama is somehow the Antichrist, the government is controlling our lives with TV, and so on. It sure must be a exciting world. Just kidding. I wonder sometimes how all the conspiracy believers even manage their lives in this much fear. Their world must be so frightening, with all this terror existing outside their homes and all. With the lizard person next to the door, and all these theories reaching such people through various questionable ""news"" sources, I mean. I highly disapprove of the conspiracy theory that involves the ""Sandy Hook"" hoax. Some of these conspiracists have been known to make threatening calls to already-grieving parents. I think to that extent, paranoia over conspiracy is very, very pernicious. Amanda Donahue from Massachusetts likes how they force us to wonder and question: I don't believe in conspiracy theories, but I do believe they are a wonderful thing. Despite the possibility of most, if not all, being untrue, they lead people to wonder. They doubt the common belief. The ""Mandela Effect"" is a very popular theory that over time small things change due to the effect of black holes. One ""effect"" from this theory is thought to be shown in the book series ""The Berenstain Bears."" While mostly everyone seems to remember pronouncing and reading the name as ""Berenstein,"" it is believed that the Mandela Effect has caused a change in the name to ""Berenstain."" A crazy theory to explain something so small, but I think there's a deeper reason that so many believe this to be true. People use this theory to stray from the idea that their belief is incorrect. They had believed something was one way, when it was really another way, so instead of admitting their false belief, they are rather using the theory of a ""black hole"" to explain why their belief is ""not wrong."" While they entertain me to read and look into, I have yet to find a conspiracy theory that I believe. Or, maybe I have yet to find something I need to cover with a conspiracy theory. _________ Nearly every commenter for our Picture Prompt ""Women in Movies"" disagreed that movies dominated by male actors should be remade with female casts. We have selected some of the most convincing, below. Ava Lanning from Danvers, Mass., said remakes are unnecessary in general: I strongly disagree because directors choose their cast based on how well a role is acted. Right? So why do people think that women need to prove that they can act just as well as guys? I think this is a little unfair. Do some people think that war-based movies that have a strong male cast need to be remade with a female cast? Also, since when do women think that it is ""unfair"" for movies to have a male-dominated role? Nevermind the fact that most remakes of movies are far worse than the original. This is an example of political correctness gone too far. As being a huge fan of attractive male actors, (which many women are) I think that movie ratings of new versions or remakes would go down. Also, I simply would not watch a movie that has been remade with female actresses' just to prove a point. What point is being proven? That women can act just as well as men? I think all of this political correctness is turning into a bigger deal than anyone would've ever expected. Ted from New York thinks the remakes are simply generated to make money: I think this movie and others like it are cynical cash-grabs and have very little to do with political correctness. Studios are more willing to bet on proven winners (the Ocean's franchise, Ghostbusters) than to take a risk on something new. I see the ""all female cast"" trend as a gimmick to justify the remakes. There are plenty of incredible ""women-centered"" movies out there. Kelly Reichardt's Certain Women, Paul Verhoeven's Elle, and Mia Hansen-Løve's Things to Come are recent examples. Anandeep from Pennsylvania looked to the future of movie-making for more roles for women: I don't believe that they should remake movies that include a male-dominated cast, but rather focus on the upcoming movies that could cast more roles for women. There are so many movies yet to be made, these movies could try and set aside a good number of roles for women who are interested in playing the parts. Brooke Myers from King of Prussia, Pa., suggested one movie that might benefit from a remake: If I had to choose a movie that I would change is ""Pirates of The Caribbean"" because even though there are girl roles, it would be cool if a girl could play Captain Jack Sparrow, the lead. _________ We occasionally use editorial cartoons and invite students to interpret them in our Picture Prompt series. Commenters felt Tax Bill had a lot to say. Rex Hardy from Wilmington, N.C., focused hard on the details: This picture clearly shows Donald Trump giving big tax cuts to wealthier families, but it's the fine details that exaggerate the message of the cartoon. The people holding Santa Claus Trump have on ragged worn out clothes, but more ragged at the bottom of the totem pole. The man at the bottom is also shaking a lot more than the ones he is carrying. I think these two details show that Trump, despite his inauthentic care for these people, cares least for the poor, homeless man on the bottom. The middle represents the lower class and lastly, the top represents the middle class. The upper class is in a nice house, receiving gifts as usual. The scene also seems to be done undercover, like nobody is supposed to be watching. It's night time, there is a guard keeping watch, and likewise to what happens on Christmas, Santa isn't supposed to be seen. Lastly, not regarding the message of the cartoon, it seems ironic that the rich person he is helping has a Spanish-style house. Jared Casey from United States offered even more observations: In this illustration, several things are immediately apparent: the fact that President Trump - being dressed as Santa Claus - is delivering the gift of a tax cut to an affluent looking man while on the backs of the lower classes, which are straining under the weight of the other three men burdening their increasingly tired, beaten shoulders. Other elements in this illustration are more interesting, though, such as the ladder that Trump used to get to the top. After more thoughtful observation, perhaps this ladder is symbolic of the fact that Trump and the Tax Cut circumvented the opinions of the lower classes. Had this ladder not been present in the illustration, the viewer would be left to assume that the climbing of Trump to the upper-class man was a joint-effort between Trump and the lower classes, effectively rewarding a deserving individual. Rather than depict the Tax Cut in this manner, the illustrator instead chose to place a ladder behind the tower of lower classes to show that this was a forced operation that had little room for personal choice among the lower classes, and was instead a direct deal between Trump and the upper class citizen. It is very well possible that this ladder makes the difference between this cartoon being a commentary on the political processes of the United States, or this illustration simply mocking the Tax Cut and it's seemingly 'crooked' motivations. Allison Zafiri from Massachusetts summed up the message: The President of the United States is depicted to be hand delivering the gift to an unphased, well kept white man. In addition, the President is seen to be reaching the achievement of passing along the tax cut with the help of literally standing on the shoulders and piggybacking off of hard worker (as shown in their tattered clothing and business attire). In the cartoon the one person that is the least wealthiest (at the bottom) has to carry all the ""weight"" and on top is average middle class citizen. Prashamsha Rayamajhi from Danvers, Mass., said the tax gift to the rich comes at the expense of the common man: This image is conveying what we were all thinking in the first place: that the new tax bill benefits the rich at the expense of the poor. The new tax bill is a ""gift"" to the rich but a burden to the middle class, the working person. It reminds me of the cartoon made before the french revolution of the third estate: how the second and the first estate (clergy + nobles) were being held up on the backs of the third estate (everyone else). This just goes to show how the new tax bill is just a way for the rich to get richer while the middle class continues to shrink. The rich, who is depicted to be inside a warm house with a cigar, is getting a present from what looks like President Trump in a Santa costume, being held up by people in normal clothes out in the cold, as the ""suits"" (or the establishment) looks on. I agree with the point of view of this cartoon. I think that the new tax bill just goes to show how close America is from crossing democracy into an oligarchy. Poor people, middle class people, the people who cannot afford to be taxed more: they're the ones that are being asked to increase their taxes, whereas the rich, who can afford taxes, are getting a tax break. It's a big fat present to them at the expense of the common man. That just makes no sense to me. Ann Nguyen from Massachusetts takes on the president's ""gift-giving"" as seen through the eyes of the illustrator: In addition to Trump's mission, a (first) legislative victory would be the perfect Christmas present for Republican congressmen. While wealthy Americans—like the satisfied man leisurely smoking the cigar in the image—are reveling in these tax cuts, the lower classes are struggling under the President's weight to support his ""gift-giving"". In reality, they will financially suffer from the tax bill, which will result in multiple problems. The most significant aspect of the image is how the scenario takes place in the cold winter setting. The Republican tax bill is the hot issue of this December. Americans will either celebrate the holidays with joy or tremble in fear/anxiety, depending upon the tax bill vote. _________ Our Student Opinion question, ""What Acts of Bravery Have You Witnessed This Year?"", yielded some lovely sentiments. Brooke Myers King of Prussia, Pa., said heroes are everywhere: Anyone can be a hero! As the article points out, people are always doing small acts of heroism and often refuse credit. I have seen so many acts of heroism as simple as letting someone sit next to someone on the bus or help bringing in groceries. These situations might not seem like a big deal but these small acts of kindness can brighten someone's day. Small acts can stop bigger situations or boost someone's courage. This reminds me of the story I heard about where a bullied student thought no one cared and cleaned out their locker. On their way they dropped their stuff and someone helped pick up the stuff. It turns out that student was going to commit suicide and that small act stopped them and gave them hope. So yeah anyone can be a hero, even you. Think about this next time you help someone or let someone sit next to you. Kylie Lundy from Wilmington, N.C., quoted a former first lady: I define a hero as someone who can put others before themselves (ie. parents), who can look fear in the eye and overcome it (i.e. women taking a stand against powerful men), and especially those who choose to endure and continue to show optimism when others told them it was unlikely or even impossible (i.e. children facing life-threatening diseases). Ultimately, you aren't born a hero or just become a hero. It's your choice. You can turn away in the face of danger or stand resilient with others and possibly stand for others who can't do it for themselves. They come in all different forms, but they are all heroes in my eyes.""You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face."" - Eleanor Roosevelt Roberto from SP called out one specific hero: Teacher Heley de Abreu Silva Batista saved many children when a crazy person set fire in a kindergarten in Brazil killing dozen children, the teacher and himself. She bravely fought against the crazy guy and saved most of the children even burning in 90% of her body. Anandeep from Pennsylvania supplied a definition of heroism: ""Courage is not having the strength to go on. It is going on when you don't have the strength."" (T.R) I don't think that there is a certain trait that makes someone courageous, it's something you just naturally chose to do. One of the heroic people out there are those who put their lives on the line to protect others. They all selflessly face danger and protect those who are afraid to do so. A hero is someone who exemplifies this trait of courage and who fits better under that definition than soldiers. Soldiers endure the sacrifice and hardships of their lifestyle to make sure others can live their lives freely without any constraints. This idea of fighting for something greater than themselves makes them one of the most courageous people out there. Juan Gonzalez from New Mexico wrote about his own bravery: I am a hero too. When my family had a house fire i woke up and called the department but they were busy. So i single handedly opened the fire hydrant and the water got on my house and controlled the fire until my the department came. _________ We asked what you thought this artist's ""Rainbow"" said about 2017 and we got a range of insightful interpretations — all of them different. Samman Naz from Massachusetts looked at it this way: 2017 makes the saying ""it's gonna get worse before it gets any better"" come to life. There have been so many negative events happening in this world, it becomes painfully overwhelming. The dominance of the black in the rainbow depicts the countless accusations of sexual harassment, the gun violence, the terrorist attacks, the natural disasters, the climate change, the threats of nuclear war, and the list goes on. The little bit of color left in the rainbow portrays the little bit of peace and humanity that is left in this world. If that black continues to spread over the rainbow, there will be nothing but darkness just like if more terrible events continue to happen in this world, the following years will be nothing but darkness. This doesn't mean that there are no positive occurrences out there that are trying to keep this crumbling world together because there are, just not enough. There will never be a time where we will live in a pure and moral world of rainbows and unicorns and sunshine. The darkness will always linger around. That's why we need to make sure that even though we cannot escape the darkness and negativeness completely, we burden them with the colorful events of peace and humanity next year, the year after, and for however long this world may last. But Emily H from South Carolina saw just the opposite: I believe that the darkness is not overtaking the rainbow, but that the light of the rainbow is slowly pushing back the darkness of all of the negative things that have happened this year. Sure, a lot of bad things have happened in 2017, but this picture depicts hope for the future and the resistance of hope and happiness against oppression and wrongdoing. See, behind the rainbow where multicoloured light is trying to break through the clouds. Soon, the clouds will clear away, and there will be hope widespread once again. Finally, the picture shows that where darkness lurks, there is always a rainbow hiding underneath, where even the most optimistic can see only darkness. Judy HHHS from Michigan wishes for kindness: We had a lot of loss this year, a lot of horrors took place all across the world. These things outshone a lot of the good things that happened this year. There is so much hate in the world these days, no one is able to get along and people search for the negativity in everything and everyone. There is little kindness to spare these days, and it's a shame that we live in the world we do. It makes me sad to see that we are headed towards a life that is filled with unhappiness and darkness. People need to be kinder and express more love and compassion towards others, so that they can reverse the rainbow and make the world a brighter place. Hunter HHHS from Michigan interpreted the illustration as a symbol for something else entirely: I see the rainbow fighting against the blackness, but I don't see it winning or losing, it is stuck. I also don't see this as a representation of 2017 but rather the fight for LGBT+ rights. Each year more countries legalize same-sex marriage, however this year America showed the world that these rights are not always guaranteed for its citizens. As of now transgender people are being kicked out of the military, and not all states have gender neutral bathrooms. Not to mention most of Trump's staff is anti-LGBT+ and so far he seems to be too. But we haven't lost and hopefully we won't either because when you take away the rights of one, you have an open door to take rights away from anyone. Harley HHHS from Hanover Horton, Mich., offered another visual representation for the year: I think that this picture is an accurate depiction of how the year of 2017 has gone so far. Nations are on the brink of war, people are dying for worthless causes and the city of Flint is still living without fresh water. The government is back to helping the 1% of people that they accurately represent and global warming is pushing species to the brink of extinction. There were many horrible things that occurred in 2017, with commercial-like breaks of happiness in between. If I could represent this year with a single picture, It would be a black and red plaid shirt. The black representing the bad and the red representing the good. This is an accurate representation to me because I feel that we had good mixed in. People this year were able to pull the good out of the bad and look on the positive side of the issues we've faced. _________ Readers weighed in with opinions on the appropriateness of ""Phones in Church"" and other places. Shelby Johnson from Massachusetts believes it is up to each person to decide how and when to use their mobile devices: I think that the choice to use a phone during church should be a personal decision. Each person has different opinions upon spirituality and should be able to express themselves however they would like. If going to church and using their phone there gives someone a calming, spiritual experience that they need, who's to say that's wrong? If simply being in church is how a person connects to their religion, and being on their phone doesn't affect this, I think that they should be able to do so and practice their religion however they see fit. However, if the phone becomes a distraction to others, that's where the line should be drawn. Cassandra DiNardo from Danvers, Mass., turned to the Hebrew Bible to support her opinion: In my opinion, I think all people must challenge themselves to follow the guidance in Ecclesiastes, one of 24 books of the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible, in that ""There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens"" 3:1-13. The predicament with this piece of wise words is to decipher where phones do and do not belong. Places of worship for example, requires another level of respect of its members towards not only the church but fellow members as well. Imagine, peaceful prayers in a cathedral/temple or anything of the like being interrupted by the shrill cry of a ringtone going off. I do not think that phones contribute to spiritual experience, but should be a personal growth and the development of a good relationship with God (or others) that a person follows. Anandeep from Pennsylvania urged turning off your phone in church: I think church is a place where you should try your best to separate yourself from all distractions and just focus on your dedication to God. Not only could it distract you, but also others around you. It's hard to focus when others around you are a distraction, so it's better to put your phone away and check it later. Most people only really go to church once a week, and it's not much at all to just ask someone to go without their phone for a couple hours a day at the most. If you're going to church and constantly just going be on your phone, then what's really the point behind going? Some commenters, like Makena Liney from King of Prussia, Pa., suggested other places where phones just don't belong: I don't think phone should be in church because it is a place you should be fully devoted to God, not your phones. It is also very hard for other to be focused on God when others are on their phones. Another place you should not have your phones are concerts. Concerts are getting more and more unnecessary, especially since we have youtube. Pulling out your phones to take a video or to text distracts other and yourself for what is slowly disappearing. Taking a video could also block the view from others behind you. Finally I think you should not have you phones if you are out to dinner with friends or family. Going on your phone during dinner is a sign of disrespect and it shows that you are not interested in what the other person has to say. Amanda Donahue from Massachusetts thought they should not be allowed in school: One place where cell phones don't belong is in the classroom. Of course I can be guilty of this a lot of the time, but I am only doing damage to myself. Each time you glance down at your phone, you are missing out on education. Maybe not missing out on the big lessons that you will be tested on, but the small things. Maybe a tip on how to study, or a small piece of knowledge not in the curriculum, but those may be the most important to you in the long run. One day you'll be in college and not know how to study for your final because when you were in the 10th grade you decided to text back your boyfriend rather than listen to the tips your English teacher was giving you. When you are utilizing the privilege of free education, put down the phone and learn. Collin MacRae from Massachusets lamented their use in social situations: Of course there are places like church, work etc. where you are expected to act formally and most people know it is inappropriate to use a phone. However, I feel as though there are many more scenarios where people choose to use a phone when it is inacceptable. For instance, when you are expected to be sociable but rather someone sits glued to their phone such as sitting at the dinner table or going on a long car ride. In my personal opinion, I think that a lot of the time people spend on their phones is wasted time because other than checking messages, the news or maybe the occasional glance at social media, there really is nothing else that is very productive or more important than what you could be doing instead of using your phone. Lauren C from Danvers, Mass., pointed out that using phones in certain places can cause us to miss out on important moments in our lives: There are some places where phones aren't acceptable whatsoever. Going through my day to day routine, I constantly see people looking down, faces glowing, on their phones completely ignoring the world around them. I see it in class, I see it put in public, and I see it in places like funerals and although I'm not a religious person I'm sure people use them at church or temple, or where ever they go to do their religious activities. I find it incredibly rude because they just tune out those who are trying to speak to them. If you were trying to speak at a funeral or a church service about something or someone that you found to be important and people were just ignoring you while they were on phones, how would that make you feel? _________ Several students wrote both commentary and the openings of short stories in response to our ""Robots"" Picture Prompt. Emma P from Danvers, Mass., described a scary world: People are no longer humans; they are programs. We are being wired to follow only a certain set of rules. Our free will is starting to deplete with every law being created in government. Our purpose is to acquire and spit out currency, the more the government restricts the easier it is for them to make big bucks. We see this programming not only in our governments, but also in our schools. Students -like the government- are only focused on getting one thing, grades. They are being programmed to memorize material and spew it back out into a bubbled scantron. We are only learning how to get by rather than what we retain in the long term. Robots are cold, meaning they have no emotion. Politicians are manipulating the people for their money. Students are cheating on tests for good grades. We are no longer humans anymore. We are only scraps of metal with a purpose of fulfilling what our program tells us to fulfill. Fit in, get by, and whatever you do don't go haywire. Or else we will have to be shut down for good. Hee Yun Chung from California imagined a scene straight from a science fiction movie: Humanity had been taken over by the machines. The machines didn't wield weapons that took human lives but wore suits and ties that killed human jobs. Every conceivable job has been taken over by a machine or software. People could no longer work and find any decent jobs that paid a decent wage. McDonald's began to employ automatic machines that made burgers for people, Wall Street was fully run by Stock trading AI, and manufacturing jobs for humans were nonexistent. The government tried many different solutions to solve the economic and unemployment crisis and eventually came to the solution of the Universal Basic Income. Though it was not perfect, UBI kept the economy together for a time. William put on his white collar shirt and headed out. ""Want to meet up at Starbucks at noon during the weekday?"" asked a roommate. ""Sorry, I have to type some new AI software for the company!"" exclaimed William. ""It will only be a matter of time."" responded the roommate. William shut the door and waited for the bus to arrive. A blue bus rolled in front of him and the doors slid open. ""Ticket please,"" said an automatic voice. William turns in a ticket and sat down in a free seat next to a random person that fell asleep. The bus stopped after a few stops and William looked up to see his office building. He entered and sat at his desk. William logged into his computer to see a red notification. William was devastated to see the message: You have been terminated from your position. And Jalen Owen from Pennsylvania made a prediction about the future: I believe that this story depicts the loss of humanity in upcoming generations. As humans, we are obsessed with building complex forms of technology to get more money and recognition. I feel as though the more this happens, the more we lose sight on what really matters. The robots that take place in this business meeting has no feelings and feel no emotions. This symbolizes our world now because the actions we make seem to show no sign for love or humanity. For example, we are so circled on technology and advancement, but we do not really find time for parts of our country that need improvements. While we are looking into the iPhone X, or the Note 8, and future forms of technology and ways to make money, there are homeless families, extreme acts of violence and racism that we should take of. _________ In response to our question ""What Were the Best and Worst Things About 2017 for You?"" readers told us about the good, the bad and the ugly of their year. From being accepted to college, obtaining a driver's license, starting a new school, winning sports competitions, seeing the solar eclipse, listening to good music and getting a job, to having to say goodbye to family members and friends and pets, leaving old schools, mourning mass shootings and witnessing natural disasters, readers learned a lot about others and themselves in 2017. In a year of highs and lows Ashleigh HHHS from Michigan  came into her own: Many people would say that this year has been nothing but disaster. Especially with all of the hurricanes that had hit all at once, the earthquakes in Mexico, and currently the wildfires in California. Some of the good things though, was the music. Music is a big thing to me so of course the many albums and songs that came out was the highlight of the year for me personally. I discovered many different artists such as Bad Suns, COIN, and Walk The Moon. even when Ed Sheeran released a new album, finally. I really have expanded my music taste and 2017 was the year for me to do that. Through this year though, I have lost quite a few family members and my family isn't all that happy with one another. Even in my own house I feel like people are fighting but in the end, we still find our ways back to each other. We had gotten a puppy almost a year ago and even though he is a big responsibility, he is now family and personally one of my favorite pets I've had. This year I've grown so much as a person by coming out of my shell and making many new friends. I found out that I was accepted to my favorite college which has many of my friends there as well as a lot of new ones. AryannaHHHS from Hanover, Mich., found some silver linings to a year filled with hardship: In my opinion 2017 hasn't been the best thing for the US. I mean a lot of stuff happened. From the presidency being corrupted to even the weather we had. For example everyone is suddenly accusing everyone who is famous of harassment or rape in someway or another and I get it is a thing to talk about, but it got to a point for me where I'm just sick of hearing about it and don't believe any of it anymore. Not to mention the net neutrality thing, which is a completely ridiculous way to gain more money. Another thing is the weather, from the two major hurricanes that hit Texas and Florida, to the wildfires that plagued California because of the major drought they were in. Despite all the bad news though, there were some good times. Like the eclipse that happened in August. While I didn't get to see anything, it was nice to see videos about the eclipse. This year also created some good movies too like Stars Wars or the my little pony movie, don't judge me. I also got to make some new friends, who are amazing, at my career center class too. Another good thing that did come out of this year is not having to do so many exams because a lot of the class exams are already done or I'm exempt from. Zach H HHHS from Hanover Horton had a good year personally, and remained hopeful about the future of the United States: 2017 was a good year for me. For one, Kendrick Lamar's new album was absolutely great to listen to for the first time. It was a unique taste after his previous album ""To Pimp a Butterfly"" went massively successful. Listening to J. Cole's new album ""4 Your Eyez Only"" was a whole new perspective for me. Songs such as ""Ville Mentality"" and ""Change"" introduced me to a whole new world in his eyes to tell me a story. Despite all of the good that happened in this world, there are some tragic, unforgettable events that happened here we'll never forget. In recent months, two mass shootings have taken news outlets channels and websites into my eyes. The mass shooting in Las Vegas claimed lives of 58 people and injured more than 300 people. Also, the mass shooting at a church in Texas claimed multiple lifes. Millions of hearts across the United States where shattered, but nothing done. I'm hoping that change can be taken place in order to prevent these and future shootings here in the U.S. not just in 2018, but today. 2017 was a better year for me than the past and hopefully much better in 2018. Good or bad, many of you found that 2017 changed you in small or big ways — like Londyn from HHHS who faced several challenges this year: Starting off my senior year I was out for a month and was in a few hospitals due to have a serve case of mono. Yet I got accepted to a few colleges and have the offer and chance to run track at a higher level. My cousin also gave birth to my youngest cousin in August giving my family the greatest blessing. Also Donald J Trump went it to office. Good? Bad? Bad. My school boy's cross country team won States and made history for my school. Everything that has happened throughout this year that I have came across has helped me have a different view on life, or change me as a person. Each year I will go through bumps in my life but its what I do to get over those problems which make me into the person I am. Molly P from Massachusetts shared a difficult experience: 2017 was the year of hardships that helped me grow into the person I am now. To classify the things that happened to me this year into the worst and best things to happen is hard due to the worst things helping me improve myself. One of the worst things to happen to me this year was for my aunt to move into my house. I know that does not seem bad at all, but just wait. My aunt was a bad alcoholic that had nowhere else to go. My mother, my aunt's youngest sister, took her under her wing and let her stay at our house. We all thought that my aunt, B, would only stay for a couple weeks. Those couple weeks turned into four months. She flipped my family upside down. All B did was yell at my mother, drink my parents' alcohol, and put everyone else in an awful mood. I hated her for doing this, especially to my poor mother who was the one to give her a roof over her head. This time period of B's stay pushed me to grow into a miserable person at first, but then instead of letting it affect me negatively, I took it and let it teach me the lessons of independence and further my positivity. It pushed me to be the light inside my house that started to grow dark. My mother became distant because of the way B made her feel. I grew more independent than I ever had been before. After four, hard months, B went to rehab. My family is back to normal, but I still am left with the lessons her stay had taught me. I believe it made me grow into the better person that I am today. _________ Thank you for contributing!"
News,2018-01-05,"ANKARA, Turkey — Out of the repressive climate of the last 18 months since a bloody coup attempt in Turkey, the most fearless challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan — and potentially his most serious rival in future elections — has been Meral Aksener.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/world/europe/turkey-aksener-erdogan.html,1139," ANKARA, Turkey — Out of the repressive climate of the last 18 months since a bloody coup attempt in Turkey, the most fearless challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan — and potentially his most serious rival in future elections — has been Meral Aksener. A former interior minister and seasoned right-wing politician, Ms. Aksener, 61, is credited with gathering much of the national support for the ""No"" campaign in an April referendum that nearly defeated Mr. Erdogan's attempt to vastly expand his powers. Now she plans to build on that support to challenge him for the presidency. She predicts that Mr. Erdogan will call early presidential elections for July 15. Expelled from the Nationalist Movement Party in September 2016 after challenging its leader over a growing alliance with Mr. Erdogan, she founded the Iyi Party, or Good Party, a year later in October. She is already campaigning around the country. ""I call it the movement of the brave,"" she said in an interview in November in new party offices in Ankara, the capital. Under the state of emergency imposed by Mr. Erdogan since the attempted coup, public gatherings are prohibited and freedom of expression and the media are tightly constrained. Most of those joining Ms. Aksener's movement are young people chafing under the restrictions, she said. Ms. Aksener and Mr. Erdogan both represent the center right of the political spectrum, but she opposes him on almost every aspect of his politics, from his increasingly autocratic form of government to his anti-Western diatribes that have damaged relations and scared off foreign investment. Mr. Erdogan remains Turkey's most popular politician by far, but last year's referendum showed that the country is deeply divided. Ms. Aksener says she is uniquely placed to draw support from right-wing nationalists and more liberal centrists who are disenchanted with Mr. Erdogan. ""We saw in the referendum the country is split in half,"" she said. ""The Good Party is the only party that can get votes from both camps."" Still, her path ahead will be anything but easy. Although Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party has slipped slightly in the polls, there is little sign that Ms. Aksener is the cause, said Kemal Can, a prominent political writer. ""Most of the polls show that she cannot draw the vote away from A.K.P.,"" he said, using the party's Turkish initials. ""She may sway 1 or 2 percent from A.K.P., but these are already estranged voters who most probably already voted No in the referendum."" Since she occupies some of the same political space as the president, Ms. Aksener is in many ways campaigning as the anti-Erdogan. She says she wants to re-establish freedom of expression, reverse draconian measures that have imprisoned journalists and closed down newspapers and media outlets, and restore a nonpartisan justice system and constitutional court. She also says she wants to reverse Mr. Erdogan's April referendum, which will introduce an executive-style presidency after the next elections, regardless of who wins. ""We are going to return to a parliamentary system,"" she said. ""The second thing is to restore trust in the economy."" The daughter of a civil servant, Ms. Aksener grew up in a small rural village in western Turkey. Her family was among the hundreds of thousands resettled from Greece in the population exchanges between Greece and Turkey in 1923. ""Despite limited education, I managed to go to university and became a lecturer,"" she said. She gained her doctorate in history in Istanbul and taught at several universities. Yet Ms. Aksener said the possibility of moving up a class through education had become elusive in Turkey, where employment has become partisan, depending on whether a person is connected to the governing party. ""The opportunity I got 45 years ago, you cannot receive today,"" she said. Education and the economy are the two things people are most concerned about on the campaign trail, she said. Thousands of families were affected when Mr. Erdogan scrapped the national high-school entrance exam in September, ordering students instead to attend their closest neighborhood school, many of which have been transformed into religious academies. ""Pupils were preparing for the exam for four years,"" Ms. Aksener said, ""and you change it overnight?"" ""Mobility between the social classes will be diminished,"" she added. ""Children will not be able to dream about their future, and this is the saddest thing."" Although Mr. Erdogan has overseen a period of impressive economic growth, allowing many in Turkey to climb out of poverty and join the middle classes, Ms. Aksener noted that the growth has been built on a construction boom rather than industrialization. Pointing to high youth unemployment, she said research conducted by her party had found that 18- to 25-year-olds from middle-income families felt trapped in a triangle of unhappiness, despair and fatalism. ""The Good Party will give hope to these people,"" she said. She entered politics in 1994, joining the True Path Party of Suleyman Demirel and serving as interior minister for nine months until a military coup replaced the government in 1997. She joined the Nationalist Movement Party in 2007 and became deputy speaker of Parliament for eight years. Although the Nationalist Movement Party has a history of extreme right-wing elements, Ms. Aksener has avoided nationalist rhetoric and describes herself as center-right. Her party manifesto is carefully worded, supporting a strong defense against terrorism, immigration and outside cultural influences. Senior members of her new party have been more outspoken, though. Umit Ozdag, the vice chairman of the Good Party, caused an outcry in November with derogatory comments about Syrian refugees. Ms. Aksener remains focused on attacking Mr. Erdogan's policies. She broke with the Nationalist Movement Party leader, Devlet Bahceli, over his support for Mr. Erdogan's new presidential system, which she criticizes for lacking checks and balances. She is also campaigning for women's rights, hoping to win over female voters. ""In the cities, women are harassed based on their gender,"" she said. ""In the villages they are beaten up or even killed."" She describes her 24 years in politics as a ""very rough political life."" During the 2015 parliamentary election campaign, supporters of Mr. Erdogan alleged on television that a video showed her cheating on her husband, a mechanical engineer. In the furor that followed, both Mr. Erdogan and his wife called her in sympathy, as did Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and his wife — although Ms. Aksener said that amid that sympathy they also encouraged her to drop out. ""I noticed there was an expectation that I should end this fight,"" she said. ""I went in the opposite direction. I continued the fight and I sued those people."" Her accusers backed off somewhat, but were later acquitted. The battle taught her a lesson, she says. ""I saw them up close,"" she said. ""I am not afraid of Erdogan, not as much as a grain of dust."""

Here's what you need to know: • Lawyers for President Trump demanded that the author Michael Wolff and his publisher halt the release of ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House"" and apologize, or face a possible lawsuit. The book includes derogatory remarks by Stephen Bannon, and others, about Mr. Trump and his family. Critics of Mr. Wolff have previously raised questions about his reporting, but Mr. Bannon, a former presidential adviser, has so far not disputed his comments in the book. Sidelined by key allies, Mr. Bannon is now confronting the possibility of an unexpected fate: irrelevance. Separately, our reporters have uncovered new information about Mr. Trump's effort to hinder the special counsel's investigation on Russia. Some legal analysts believe the president's efforts could be seen as an obstruction of justice. _____ • The Trump administration said it would allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all U.S. coastal waters. A number of states are expected to challenge the plan to protect their coastlines. Separately, the Justice Department is strengthening enforcement of federal marijuana laws, potentially undermining legalization in six states, most recently California. And abroad, the administration is suspending nearly all security aid to Pakistan, in frustration over the country's failure to confront terrorist networks within its borders. _____ • In Turkey,  Meral Aksener, above, has stepped up to challenge President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian rule. Ms. Aksener is already campaigning for early presidential elections, which she expects in July. Education and the economy are the key issues for voters, she told our Istanbul bureau chief. Meanwhile, the conviction in the U.S. of a Turkish banker left Mr. Erdogan largely unscathed at home. Analysts said Mr. Erdogan's government had successfully framed the case as a plot by his enemies. Mr. Erdogan is visiting France today as part of an effort to mend strained European ties. _____ • CES, the giant tech trade show that starts on Sunday, will provide a window into emerging tech trends.

Calls for a major thoroughfare connecting San Francisco to Marin County, to the north, began after the city's population increased tenfold during the Gold Rush. Before the bridge was painted its iconic international orange, architects also considered a proposal from the U.S. Navy for a striped design that would make the structure more visible to ships and airplanes. The distinct reddish-orange hue was chosen to complement the bridge's natural surroundings: the hills, the fog and the San Francisco Bay. The city hired the engineer Joseph Strauss to build the 1.7-mile-long bridge, the longest and tallest of its kind at the time. The bridge opened four years later to great fanfare. The Times called it ""one of the greatest engineering structures of man,"" and Mr. Strauss penned a poem, ""The Mighty Task Is Done,"" for the occasion. ""The bridge is a triumphant structure, a testimony to the creativity of mankind,"" the historian Kevin Starr wrote in 2010, offering ""enduring proof that human beings can alter the planet with reverence.""

News,2018-01-05,The bustling United States economy is beginning to benefit some American workers who have not gotten a taste of the recovery and have been most in need of relief.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/business/economy/jobs-report.html,1284," The bustling United States economy is beginning to benefit some American workers who have not gotten a taste of the recovery and have been most in need of relief. That picture was reinforced by a report on Friday from the Labor Department, which showed an increase of 148,000 jobs last month. The figure fell short of economists' expectations, but some of the most impressive job gains in the past year were in blue-collar and service industries that pay a decent salary. Over all, average hourly earnings were 2.5 percent higher in December compared with the year before, scarcely keeping up with inflation. But other data shows that wages have increased most for the least-educated workers and for people in many industries that are generally low-paying. ""Growth is strong, and the benefits of this growth have been widely shared,"" Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Indeed.com, a job-search site. ""This has been a year in which some of the gaps in the economy that had been growing narrowed a bit."" Manual-labor positions are the kinds of jobs that President Trump has promised to bring back in droves, so progress could be politically important. Hiring picked up fastest in construction and mining. Manufacturing, which lost jobs in 2016, expanded last year at a respectable clip, part of a global resurgence. Reflecting the economy's resilience, overall hiring in 2017 was only slightly lower than in 2016 — and it has risen for 87 consecutive months, a remarkable feat. The unemployment rate was steady at 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. The numbers point to an economy that still has some room to grow. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Mr. Trump cited the unemployment rate as evidence that the economy is ""only getting better!"" When he took office last January, the rate was 4.8 percent. Most economists say presidents do not generally determine the economy's course, and it is too early to measure the hiring effects of the tax cut signed into law last month. But Mr. Trump's agenda may be having an impact on the economy in other ways. His push to dismantle regulations on businesses seems to have emboldened corporations to start putting more money into machines and plants, the kind of spending that drives broad growth. A separate survey of manufacturers released on Wednesday suggested that American factories have picked up their orders, production and hiring over the past year. Democrats offered a less sanguine view of the labor market, asserting that most Americans were still enduring paltry raises and that the Republican tax plan was a boon only to the upper stratum of the country. Among the solutions advocated by Democrats is to increase the minimum wage, as 18 states did on Jan. 1. ""The American economy is unbalanced,"" Representative Joe Crowley of New York, the leader of the House Democratic Caucus, said in a statement. ""Workers struggle to find financial security while special interests, corporations, and the richest among us enjoy lavish tax breaks."" Wages have been one of the most intensely debated puzzles of the labor market, with incomes growing at a more sluggish rate than the hiring demand would suggest. There are signs beneath the surface, though, that more widespread wage growth may be around the corner. The security industry, for example, where pay is below average, showed a 7 percent increase in hourly earnings in November from a year earlier. Workers in clothing stores and food services — two huge, generally low-paying businesses — saw wages rise by around 4 percent in that period. In areas where unemployment has dipped below the national rate, pay has begun to accelerate. Cities where joblessness is 3.5 percent or lower have had an impressive 4 percent year-over-year increase in earnings, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics. In Indianapolis, where unemployment reached 3.1 percent in November, wages for jobs in the private sector rose by nearly 5 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. ""If the unemployment rate everywhere gets to 3.5 percent, then wage growth everywhere will get to 4 percent,"" Mr. Shepherdson said. That kind of tightening may nudge some employers who have resisted giving raises. ""The wage growth rate kicking in isn't an automatic thing that happens in the economy,"" said Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, a job-listing platform. ""It requires employers to feel that friction, that competition for talent, to change what they offer recruits."" E-commerce companies have begun to raise wages in hot warehouse markets, such as Memphis or the Inland Empire in Southern California, said Bill Ravenscroft, a senior vice president at Adecco Staffing USA. The agency employs around 60,000 workers, hiring more during the holiday season, and places many in distribution centers and warehouses often used by e-commerce giants. But employers are not taking that approach across the board. Many are vying for pickers, packers and shippers by offering new perks. Logistics companies have begun providing on-site child care, or reimbursing employees who need to put their children in day care while they work. Some companies are entering workers in raffles every week to win laptops, televisions and tablets, or are bringing food trucks to their warehouses and paying for employees' lunches. ""These types of benefits in the past, you associated them with Silicon Valley, start-up companies,"" Mr. Ravenscroft said. ""They weren't synonymous with your traditional employers."" Clients are hesitant to offer permanent wage increases, he said, but that could change if the jobless rate continues to dip. Bob Peterson, the chief executive of Melton Truck Lines, said he had been feeling the job market's heat all year, and that he now had no choice but to raise pay for his 1,600 drivers. ""With unemployment this low, anyone worth their salt has got a job and probably a darn good one,"" Mr. Peterson said. Melton operates in 48 states and has offices in five. The tight job market has been especially tough on Mr. Peterson, because he requires a drug test for everyone who comes through the door. Many fail, especially after several states legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use. ""There's guys and gals that like to smoke weed, but they can't drive a commercial vehicle because it's prohibited,"" Mr. Peterson said. ""Some people get here and we find out, oops, they have been smoking or injecting."" Mr. Peterson has not given raises in two years, he said, because when he had asked his clients to increase their rates, they threatened to hire another trucking company. He is planning to increase salaries by 10 percent in 2018. Part of the reason, he said, was that he was seeing hiring pick up in the construction business and in manufacturing, two sectors that he competed with for able bodies. ""No one is having an easy time hiring blue-collar workers today,"" Mr. Peterson said. Those pressures are bearing down on manufacturing, which added a solid 196,000 jobs last year, and construction, where payrolls increased by 210,000. Mining employers also posted solid gains, bucking a trend of job losses in recent years. The crash in oil prices in 2014 was particularly hard on jobs in the mining sector, which includes support services in oil fields, and had ripple effects on construction and manufacturing, partly because American companies make much of the world's mining equipment. Oil prices have begun to climb, and that may be one piece of the expansion in all three sectors, economists said. The rest of the world is also in the midst of a strong recovery, helping to drive an American uptick in productive blue-collar work. ""The manufacturing upturn story is a global story,"" Mr. Shepherdson said. ""It's happening everywhere. You can't take credit for the recovery in Europe and China."""
News,2018-01-05,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration finally crossed the line for some members of Congress this week, provoking bipartisan umbrage and accompanying pledges to hold top officials accountable.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/us/politics/trump-marijuana-policy-bipartisan-fire.html,1024," WASHINGTON — The Trump administration finally crossed the line for some members of Congress this week, provoking bipartisan umbrage and accompanying pledges to hold top officials accountable. Many thought the day had been far too long in coming. Few thought the galvanizing issue would be weed. Both Republicans and Democrats reacted with dismay and howls of betrayal to the decision by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to renew tough federal enforcement of marijuana laws, illustrating the growing power both politically and economically of the emerging industry. ""I am obligated to the people of Colorado to take all steps necessary to protect the state of Colorado and their rights,"" said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, a conservative member of the Republican leadership who has rarely broken with the Trump White House. Mr. Gardner said he had been assured by both President Trump and Mr. Sessions before voting for the attorney general's confirmation that backtracking on marijuana would not be a focus of the administration. The senator seemed flabbergasted by what amounted to a federal assault on the expanding $1 billion legal pot business approved by voters in Colorado, and he threatened to try to block all Justice Department nominees until Mr. Sessions backed off. He was not the only unhappy Republican. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said in a statement that she had repeatedly discouraged Mr. Sessions from taking action on marijuana, a move that she called regrettable and disruptive. Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, a leading Trump ally in the House, said the decision would deny relief to suffering cancer patients, including children. He said the move by Mr. Sessions was ""heartless and cold, and shows his desire to pursue an antiquated, disproven dogma instead of the will of the American people. He should focus his energies on prosecuting criminals, not patients."" Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader whose state began allowing the sale of recreational marijuana this week, also pointed to the strong national sentiment for legalization shown in votes around the country in recent years. ""Attorney General Jeff Sessions's decision bulldozes over the will of the American people and insults the democratic process under which majorities of voters in California and in states across the nation supported decriminalization at the ballot box,"" she said. ""Yet again, Republicans expose their utter hypocrisy in paying lip service to states' rights while trampling over laws they personally dislike."" She and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said they would try to use a pending spending package to prevent Mr. Sessions from following through on the plan to overturn an Obama-era policy that made marijuana prohibition a low priority for law enforcement. Mr. Leahy noted that such a provision had previously passed the Senate Appropriations Committee with support from both parties. The pushback was not the only bipartisan resistance coming in the middle of the furor surrounding Mr. Trump's emphatic break with his former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, in the aftermath of his reported comments in a new book about the presidency. An Interior Department plan to open much of the nation's coastline to new oil exploration also drew strong opposition from some Republicans, including Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a likely candidate for the Senate this year. The new marijuana policy and the oil drilling effort could present political peril for Republicans in Colorado and states along both coasts in some of the same locales where resentment to the new tax plan has already surfaced. Politicians in both parties from Florida up the Eastern Seaboard have fought expanded oil exploration for decades, responding to strong public opinion in those states. Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a longtime opponent of offshore drilling who could be facing off against Mr. Scott in a high-profile Senate contest, immediately jumped on the issue. ""This plan is an assault on Florida's economy, our national security, the will of the public and the environment,"" Mr. Nelson said. ""This proposal defies all common sense, and I will do everything I can to defeat it."" At the White House, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the administration did not intend to start a fight with Mr. Scott but would not shy away from one either. ""Just because we may differ on issues from time to time doesn't mean that we can't still have an incredibly strong and good relationship,"" she said. ""We'll continue those conversations with him and hopefully all come to an agreement."" As for the president's evolution on marijuana, Ms. Sanders said Mr. Trump ""believes in enforcing federal law. That would be his top priority, and that is regardless of what the topic is."" When it comes to marijuana, Mr. Gardner, as the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee as well as a senator from Colorado, is well versed in its politics. Like other leading state politicians, he personally opposed the proposal to legalize the substance but now sees his role as sticking up for his state's law and industry. He will no doubt face criticism if he does not now follow through. He pointedly and repeatedly asked on Thursday what had changed since Mr. Trump said during his campaign that he considered marijuana enforcement a state issue. ""The people of Colorado spoke — they spoke loudly,"" Mr. Gardner said on the Senate floor. ""And I believe if the same question were asked today, they would have even more support for the decision they made back several years ago. I agree with President Trump, that this decision should be left up to the people of Colorado."" Mr. Sessions has long considered marijuana dangerous. And he has not been reluctant to break with his Republican colleagues on other issues that had bipartisan backing, notably a criminal justice overhaul. His stiff opposition to that plan helped scuttle it in the Senate in 2016 and dimmed its future when he moved over to the Justice Department. But the legalization of marijuana has proved to be a job-creating, tourist-attracting, vote-getting success in certain states, with more entertaining the idea. The attorney general and the president may find resistance to their pot policy to be much more potent than they anticipated."
News,2018-01-05,"When Amuche Chukudebelu, a programmer at a finance company, became a landlord about a decade ago, he knew very little about how to set the rent for the two apartments he planned to rent out in his brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/realestate/small-landlord-calculate-rent.html,2026," When Amuche Chukudebelu, a programmer at a finance company, became a landlord about a decade ago, he knew very little about how to set the rent for the two apartments he planned to rent out in his brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. He didn't want to be a landlord who was constantly raising the rent on his tenants. But despite locking in relatively high rents initially, the market quickly rose around him, and by 2014, he had one tenant paying $1,450 a month when the market rate was closer to $2,000. ""I was like, 'Wait a second. I'm way below market,'"" said Mr. Chukudebelu, who has since become a real estate agent at Citi Habitats and found his dilemma at best uncomfortable. ""You want to be compassionate, but there are also expenses that are increasing. And the market is the market."" While the city's larger, institutional landlords may use algorithms to set rents, informing tenants of increases by letter, for many smaller landlords, the process is not so impersonal. They may rent just a few units, often in the building where they live, relying on the income to make their mortgage payments. Many see their tenants in the hall, know what kind of music they listen to and exchange neighborhood gossip on the stoop. And though most say that they follow general principles and guidelines when determining rents, not all of those are financial, and they are far from uniform. Squaring business interests with one's personal and political beliefs, of course, can be a messy business. Consider the brouhaha last year when Politico revealed that Mayor Bill de Blasio, a small landlord who has made affordable housing one of his signature issues, had raised the rent on one of the units in a two-family Park Slope house that he and his wife own. While the increase, from $2,400 in 2009 to $2,850 in 2016, broke down to a relatively modest 2 or 3 percent per year, Mr. de Blasio, who declined to be interviewed for this story, had spent the previous two years calling for — and getting — zero percent increases for the city's rent-stabilized units. While the Rent Guidelines Board sets increases for the city's million or so rent-regulated tenants, increases on market-rate units are entirely at the discretion of landlords, who weigh potential profits against the possibility of losing reliable tenants and the cost of vacancy. As for determining what the market rate is, small landlords say they do various things, from looking through nearby listings to asking neighbors and visiting open houses. And in New York, there are many more of those small landlords than you might think. The Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord advocacy group, says that 70 percent of its 25,000 members are small-property owners, who have one or two buildings with no more than 48 apartments in each. Christopher Athineos, who with his parents owns 150 apartments in 9 buildings, a mix of rent-regulated and market-rate units in Bay Ridge, Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights, said that while ""obviously this is our business, you get close to it"" — especially if you get to know your tenants well. His parents bought their first property in 1968 and still live in one of their buildings. Mr. Athineos grew up with some of his current tenants and goes to their children's baptisms and other events. He even agreed to help the niece of an older tenant scatter the ashes of that tenant when she passed away. ""I do cut people a break. I have a couple of senior citizens in Bay Ridge — one woman, her husband passed away a long time ago, she's in her 80s, on fixed income. I'm like, 'Sign the lease renewal, no increase,'"" Mr. Athineos said. ""Or I increase her $5, so she doesn't feel like a charity case."" For other tenants, he said he usually raises rent by 1 to 3 percent on the second renewal. ""No one likes an increase on their first year,"" Mr. Athineos said. ""But I've made the mistake in the past where I don't increase them for four years, then all of a sudden, you have to ask them for $75 or $100, and they're like, ""'Oh my god, you're killing me.'"" The key thing, landlords agree, is to hang onto good tenants — the ones who pay on time, take care of the apartment and call you when the radiator's leaking all over the floor, but not, as one landlord said, ""because the refrigerator makes too much noise."" Minimizing turnover is important, because empty apartments have to get cleaned, repainted and repaired. And there is often at least a one-month gap between tenants, with no rent coming in. Some landlords avoid raising the rent at all when they have a good tenant, preferring to catch up to the market the next time they list the apartment. ""I never raise it when they're there,"" said Jude Bernard, who started buying brownstones in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, in the late 1990s. ""I was lucky enough to buy my buildings when they were well, well below what they're worth today. My mortgage is very low. My unwritten rule is: You don't bother me, I don't bother you."" One tenant whom he had been renting to since 2006 ""was like a ghost,"" he said approvingly, so he was happy to keep her at the same rent that she paid when she moved into the three-bedroom duplex garden apartment, $2,500 a month. But last summer, the tenant got a new roommate who started calling him all the time about what he said were minor problems or nonissues. So at renewal time, he sent them a letter raising the rent to $4,500. ""She assured me her new roommate would not be calling me anymore, and we negotiated a new rent of $3,500,"" Mr. Bernard said. ""From what I gathered, the new roommate came from a Manhattan doorman building and was accustomed to 'Hey, a light in the apartment is out.' That's not brownstone living. We don't do concierge service."" Landlords who share houses with their tenants are often even more willing to go below market rate — sometimes substantially — for a friendly tenant. Mary and Larry Heintjes are artists who own a carriage house on the border of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, and rent out a studio apartment across the hall from their two-bedroom. The unit goes for well under market rate. As Ms. Heintjes explained, ""We wanted a certain kind of person, someone who is kind and communicative. We didn't want to lose that kind of person by charging a rent that would be for someone who is more corporate."" That view was shaped by their history in the house. The same day that they closed on the property in 1997, Mr. Heintjes's mother had a stroke. During the renovation, they decided that she should move in with them. She stayed for five years, until she needed round-the-clock care, which is when they turned her room into a studio apartment. With property taxes increasing and their two daughters nearing college age, they needed the extra income, but they wanted a renter who felt like family. Charging considerably below market rate has allowed them to get just that. Previous tenants, a couple who bought a house in Albany, stay with them regularly when they are in the city. But last spring, they needed to find a new tenant after nearly a decade with virtually no rent increases, so they consulted a friend, Craig Meachen, who is also a real estate broker. He helped them calculate a rent that was several hundred dollars higher than they had been charging, getting them closer to market rate. But even in the coziest relationships, money — and paying the mortgage — can be a big issue. After Bibi Calderaro, an artist and broker, and her husband, a photographer, bought a townhouse in Bed-Stuy six years ago, they rented out the garden apartment for $1,800 a month. The first few tenants were on yearlong fellowships, and another moved out because she wanted a dog. With every transition, they recalibrated the rent to the rising market. Last year, they listed the apartment for $2,300, or $100 more than the previous tenant had been paying, and got no takers. Then they lowered the price to what the last tenant had been paying, and still it didn't rent. Grudgingly, they lowered it again, to $2,175, in response to what the market was telling them. But that didn't make the rent decrease any easier to take. That monthly income is how ""I pay my mortgage,"" Ms. Calderaro said. ""We're not only trying to keep up with inflation, but the real estate taxes have gone up. Our economy is much more fragile than larger landlords'."" Still, if there is a common thread among most small landlords in the city, it is that they choose not to chase the highest rent they could get. When Marta Satwin-Ramberg, an architect, and her husband, a graphic designer, bought and renovated a three-unit rowhouse in Ridgewood, Queens, six years ago, they picked a midpoint between the going rate for unrenovated apartments in the area and what seemed like unreasonable asks in several nearby buildings that developers had redone. Last fall, they asked $2,000 for a railroad-style two-bedroom. ""I'm not going to be pushing the top boundaries of what I could get, ""Ms. Satwin-Ramberg said. ""I'd rather rent to friends of friends. I feel like the way I set those rents are what would be bearable for me."" Amit Kalra owns three properties in Queens and several more in Nashville, to which he applies very different rental philosophies. He bought his first building, in Woodside, seven years ago, after his father died. His mother took one of the six units, and for a time, his sister lived in another. He lived right around the corner and got to know the tenants well, inviting them to barbecues at his house. When taxes or heating costs go up, he sends them a letter explaining the increase and how it will affect their rent. And for the past three years, he has kept the rent flat for a tenant with a special-needs child. In Nashville, however, he uses a management company and, until new inventory started flooding the market last year, would regularly ask for 6 or 7 percent annual increases. He made his decisions based on recommendations from the management company and his own research on the market there. ""I don't see the Nashville properties every day, so I treat it more like a business,"" Mr. Kalra said. ""In Woodside, it's much more friendly. You can't help but be emotionally attached. You become conscious of the tenants' situations and that the biggest check they write every month is to you."" Being cognizant of those things can certainly make asking for more rent difficult, as Mr. Chukudebelu, the landlord in Bed-Stuy, discovered when he finally approached his $1,450-a-month tenant about an increase. At first, he asked for $100 more a month, which she agreed was reasonable. But the next year, when he tried to raise it another $100, she balked, and they negotiated a two-year lease with $75 and $50 increases, which would eventually bring the rent to $1,675. After that, he said, ""came the moment of truth."" He asked for another $75 increase, wanting to bring the rent to within a few hundred dollars of the $2,000 market rate. ""And I knew that was a stretch for her,"" he said. ""That definitely weighed on me. But then I was like, 'Do I take a loss so she doesn't?'"" Ultimately, the tenant got a roommate, and they now pay $1,800 a month, which puts the rent close enough to market rate that Mr. Chukudebelu can ask for much smaller increases at future renewals. In hindsight, he realized that his impulse to avoid raising the rent at all on a good tenant was well intentioned but a bit naïve, since it put him so far behind. ""I wanted to be compassionate,"" he said, ""but that was a little too much of a compassionate viewpoint."""

Here's what you need to know: • Don't let Jeff Sessions recuse himself. That was President Trump's instruction to the top White House lawyer in March, shortly before the attorney general removed himself from the investigation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The unsuccessful lobbying effort was one of several previously unreported episodes that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has learned about. Central to his inquiry is whether the president obstructed justice and whether there was collusion between his campaign and Russia. • Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer dealing with the special counsel's investigation, declined to comment. • Stephen Bannon has lost the support of some of his most important backers — including the family of the hedge fund magnate Robert Mercer — after Mr. Bannon made provocative comments about President Trump and his family to the author of a new book. Mr. Trump's legal threats to block the work prompted its publisher to move up its release date to today. • We also profile Michael Wolff, the author of the book and ""a prime piranha in the Manhattan media pond."" • There will be subzero wind chills in the Northeast in the next couple of days after a storm with hurricane-strength winds socked the region. In New York City, it could feel like minus 20 degrees tonight and Saturday night. (The forecast for the summit of Mount Washington in New Hampshire is minus 95.) More than 4,000 flights were grounded on Thursday, and hundreds have been canceled today. • What was it like in New York?  Watch our video. • The Trump administration has freed prosecutors to aggressively enforce federal laws against the drug in states that have decriminalized it. The reaction in California, where recreational cannabis became legal on Monday, was not mellow. The move highlights confusion over the legality of marijuana where state and federal law conflict. Have a question? Ask us. • In Congress, lawmakers from both parties who view the issue as a state decision oppose the Justice Department's new policy. • More than 200,000 people seek addiction treatment on the phone or online every month. Their pleas for help are a valuable commodity, Dr. Alan Goodwin, a psychologist in Palm Beach, Fla., recently discovered. Our story retraces his monthslong mission to understand the ethically murky business of customer acquisition in the treatment world. • It's the final part of our series on the industry of addiction treatment. • The high-level negotiations between North and South Korea will be the first in more than two years. They will be held in the border village of Panmunjom. • The Trump administration plans to allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all U.S. coastal waters. • The U.S. economy added 148,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 percent, the Labor Department reported today. •  Iranian hackers have moved from defacing websites to cyberespionage campaigns. They still feel they're underpaid. • U.S. stocks were up on Thursday, and the Dow broke 25,000 for the first time. Here's a snapshot of global markets today. Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • Follow these New Year's resolutions for better health. • With two security flaws affecting almost all computers, here's what you can do to protect yourself. • Bake the ultimate make-ahead treat: cinnamon rolls. • Partisan writing you shouldn't miss. Writers from across the political spectrum discuss the clash between President Trump and his former chief strategist, Stephen Bannon. • Republican wins in Virginia. The House of Delegates remains under Republican control after a slip of paper was drawn from a bowl to determine the winner of a tied race. • In memoriam Brendan Byrne, the governor of New Jersey from 1974 to 1982, won passage of the state's first income tax and helped lure professional sports teams to the Meadowlands. He also helped bring casinos to Atlantic City. He was 93. • New admissions policy at the Met Citing financial necessity, the Metropolitan Museum of Art will soon charge $25 to out-of-state visitors. Our chief art critics aren't fans of the change. • Ready for the weekend The Golden Globe Awards are Sunday. We spoke to the comedian Seth Meyers, a first-time host, about Hollywood's first major awards show since a wave of sexual misconduct scandals. The Times has started a book club with ""PBS NewsHour.""

And the N.F.L. playoffs begin this weekend. Here are our predictions for the wild-card games. • Best of late-night TV The hottest topic on comedy television was a book: ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House."" • Quotation of the day ""A correction would be healthy. The longer we go without one, the greater the risk this will end badly."" — James Stack, a market historian, who says the bull market in stocks will eventually end. Construction of the Golden Gate Bridge began on this day in 1933, more than 60 years after it was first proposed. Calls for a major thoroughfare connecting San Francisco to Marin County, to the north, began after the city's population increased tenfold during the Gold Rush. Before the bridge was painted in its iconic ""international orange,"" architects considered a U.S. Navy proposal for a striped design to make the structure more visible to ships and airplanes. The distinct reddish-orange hue was chosen to complement the bridge's natural surroundings: the hills, the fog and the San Francisco Bay. The city hired the engineer Joseph Strauss to build the 1.7-mile-long bridge, the longest and tallest of its kind at the time. The bridge opened four years later to great fanfare. The Times called it ""one of the greatest engineering structures of man,"" and Mr. Strauss penned a poem, ""The Mighty Task Is Done,"" for the occasion. ""The bridge is a triumphant structure, a testimony to the creativity of mankind,"" the historian Kevin Starr wrote in 2010, offering ""enduring proof that human beings can alter the planet with reverence.""

News,2018-01-05,A singer’s natural home is on the stage. But the vocalist and composer Alicia Hall Moran’s newest piece lives on the rink.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/arts/music/alicia-hall-moran-ice-skating-music.html,970," A singer's natural home is on the stage. But the vocalist and composer Alicia Hall Moran's newest piece lives on the rink. Ms. Hall Moran's undefinable ""Breaking Ice: The Battle of the Carmens"" finds its inspiration in figure skating history, and the work will have its premiere in the midst of public skating sessions at Bryant Park on Jan. 11 and Riverbank State Park on Jan. 14, as part of the Prototype festival of new music theater. ""The Battle of the Carmens"" referenced in the title wasn't just an opera lover's fever dream. It was a bit of media hyperbole that described the showdown between skating rivals, both of whom performed to music from Bizet's classic opera, at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. Katarina Witt, from East Germany, fully inhabited the role of the cigarette-girl femme fatale through her dramatic choreography, while the American Debi Thomas, then a pre-med student at Stanford University, strove for technical excellence with a gymnast's clean lines and economy of style. Even though Ms. Thomas faltered, ultimately receiving the bronze, Ms. Hall Moran remembers her performance as a victory; she was the first African-American to win a medal in the Winter Games. Ms. Hall Moran, then a 14-year-old skater avidly following the Olympics, easily related to the two-time U.S. national champion, who was 20 at the time. ""Debi Thomas not only looked like me, she really looked like me,"" Ms. Hall Moran said in a recent interview. ""We could have been sisters. And my parents went to Stanford. I never thought that skating was going to take me to Lillehammer"" — the Norwegian town that hosted the 1994 Winter Games — ""but she made the sport something into which I could realistically and holistically pour my identity."" Although Ms. Hall Moran's athletic career never advanced beyond a spot on a local synchronized skating team, she will take to the blades herself for ""Breaking Ice,"" accompanied by tango skaters from Ice Theater of New York. The performance at Bryant Park is free of charge, while the one at Riverbank costs only the rink's admission fee ($5 for adults, $3 for children). Anyone who wants to join the action on the ice needs to bring or rent skates and ideally should be capable of navigating the frozen terrain. ""Vocalists like to talk about grounded singing,"" Ms. Hall Moran said with a grin. ""Trying to activate the space between the bottom of your feet and that cold surface is a bit like levitating."" A backing track, at the mercy of each rink's dubious acoustics, will structure the piece: The mash-up of Carmen's ""Habanera"" with Stevie Wonder's ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)"" on Ms. Hall Moran's recently released album, ""Here Today,"" offers a taste of what the music might sound like. But she has also left ample room for improvisation with the taiko drummer Kaoru Watanabe and the saxophonist Maria Grand, who will be stationed in hockey penalty boxes nearby, as well as through the physical interaction with the swirl of bodies watching and surrounding her. This kind of imaginative recontextualization of classical singing has long propelled Ms. Hall Moran. She is a trained mezzo-soprano who never tries to sound like anything else, despite the diverse artistic company she keeps. She has participated in a number of residencies, including one with her husband, the jazz pianist and composer Jason Moran, as part of the 2012 Whitney Biennial; toured with the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company; made her Broadway debut as Bess in ""Porgy and Bess""; and partnered with jazz musicians like the guitarist Brandon Ross and Mr. Moran. In her work, as in that of the visual artist Kara Walker, historical genres like spirituals and Motown (and even the racialized figure of Bizet's Carmen herself) take on new, charged meanings in juxtaposition with contemporary forms. During a practice session two weeks ago with Moira North, the artistic director of Ice Theater of New York, Ms. Hall Moran indeed evoked Debi Thomas. In a flowing cardigan, ribbons of hair tied back at the base of her neck, she appeared longer limbed than her old hero, though. While a compact body holds advantages for most skating hopefuls, Ms. Hall Moran's height was actually an asset when she was the only black member of the Shadows, one of the three synchronized skating teams at Terry Conners Rink in Stamford, Conn., where she grew up in an affluent family. (Her best friend was the daughter of the black mezzo-soprano star Shirley Verrett.) ""I was the anchor, standing tall in the center and pulling little 90-pound advanced skaters around in these pinwheels,"" she recalled. Skating fell into the background as Ms. Hall Moran joined a busy choir at her public high school that performed internationally, attended Barnard College and then started her music career. But now, in her new piece, she is returning to the ice, seeking to broaden our perspective on a sport thought to be populated solely by rich white princesses. (She believes Ms. Thomas, wanting to resist embodying stereotypes of overly sensual black women, failed to win Olympic gold because she didn't give people the boldly carnal Carmen they were expecting.) And at a time when the film ""I, Tonya"" has rekindled interest in Tonya Harding, depicted as a redneck who failed to find acceptance despite her prodigious talents, ""Breaking Ice"" has the potential to demonstrate ice skating's genuine inclusiveness. ""The elite world of competitive figure skating is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the people who are fearless enough to even try the sport,"" Ms. Hall Moran said. ""If you are to truly address what skating is, the evidence shows us that it's millions of people of color and from the working class. Just go to any public session: Everyone is on the ice."""
News,2018-01-05,Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/business/dealbook/dow-25000-markets.html,3041," Good Friday. Here's what we're watching: • Here's what to expect this earnings season. • How many rate increases next year? • Spotify's chief content officer is exiting ahead of its I.P.O. • How soft was the jobs report? • Spotify's chief content officer is exiting ahead of its I.P.O. • What are the odds of the markets continuing to rise? • Fitbit makes its first start-up investment. Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. Last year's rally has shown few signs of slowing down in 2018. If anything, the record run in stocks appears to be gaining momentum. The Dow Jones industrial average just recorded its best start to the year since 2003, reports the WSJ. Having just surpassed 25,000 on Thursday, the blue-chip is already more than a quarter of the way to 26,000. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.6 percent after posting four straight records during the holiday-shortened week. That was its best start to a year since 2006. Tech stocks surged 4.2 percent to begin the New Year. Fourth-quarter earnings season kicks off next week with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo & Co. and BlackRock all reporting Friday. Here's what Wall Street analysts are expecting, courtesy of FactSet. • Analysts expect companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index to report profits rose 10.5 percent from a year ago, according to FactSet. • All 11 sectors are forecast to report earnings growth. • The index's energy companies are expected to show the biggest jump, up 132 percent. That increase is largely a result of the continued rebound in oil prices. The two-year free-fall in oil prices that began in 2014 decimated the bottom line of energy companies, but since the second half of last year, the sector's profits have been rebounding. • If analysts forecast for earnings prove correct, it will mark the third quarter in the past four that the S.&P. 500 has posted double-digit gains in earnings. • Sales are forecast to grow 6.7 percent. Most Federal Reserve officials expect to raise rates three times this year. A number of private economists, including Goldman Sachs's Jan Hatzius, are forecasting four. The market, meanwhile, has priced in only two. The Fed, though, could surprise investors to the upside, writes Christopher Beddor of Breakingviews. ""December's relatively weak jobs and wage growth figures give policymakers a breather. But with 2.1 million jobs created in 2017 and unemployment nearing historically low levels, long-awaited wage rises — along with new tax cuts — might soon bring the prospect of higher inflation on the agenda."" Mr. Beddor added: ""The question is how much tighter the job market can get before pulling wages, and inflation, higher. Minutes from the December FOMC meeting, released this week, suggest some members worry tighter labor market conditions could start feeding into inflation. The readout also showed uncertainty about the extent that tax cuts might stimulate the economy and boost prices. Already companies including AT&T, American Airlines and Wells Fargo have announced bonuses or wage increases after President Donald Trump signed the cuts into law last month."" Recode's Peter Kafka reports that ""Stefan Blom, Spotify's chief content officer, announced his departure via an internal memo Friday."" The NYT and others reported earlier this week that Spotify had filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in the first quarter of this year. Via Recode: ""The timing of Blom's exit may raise questions for investors as they look at Spotify. ""Last year, the executive helped Spotify secure critical licenses with the big music labels that paved the way for the company's IPO. But he has also been in charge of the company's attempted push into video, which has stopped and started a few times without gaining traction."" • F.B.I. agents have renewed asking questions about the dealings of the Clinton Foundation amid calls from President Trump and top Republicans for the Justice Department to take a fresh look at politically charged accusations of corruption. (NYT) • The first known criminal referral has emerged from Congress's Russia inquiries. The target is the author of the Trump-Russia dossier. (NYT) • The nation's political and financial capitals have never felt so far apart. Washington is kicking off the new year with a fresh round of Trump-fueled chaos. On Wall Street, meanwhile, the sky hardly seems the limit. (WaPo) • Gary Cohn told Bloomberg TV that the Trump administration may try to block potential plans by high-tax states including New York and California to shield residents from state and local tax break changes. (Bloomberg) • American cannabis startups raised a record amount of venture capital last year, with 69 companies snaring nearly $274 million. (Axios) • Netflix shares jumped 1.4 percent to an all-time high after the video-streaming service announced a Jan. 12 premiere for the new show from longtime talk-show host David Letterman. (FastFt) • Lionel Messi has written a clause into his contract with FC Barcelona allowing him to leave the team if Catalan independence means he can't play top-league soccer. (Bloomberg) • Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares closed above $300,000 for the first time Thursday, marking a new record for the world's most expensive stock. Here are some items you can buy from Berkshire businesses for the price of one A share. (MoneyBeat) The headline number of 148,000 jobs added came in well below the 198,000 expected by Wall Street economists. But don't read too much into the miss. The trend remains strong. The United States economy has added jobs for 87 straight months, an unparalleled run, and the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low. On top of all that, the number may be revised upward in the coming months. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, writes: ""The details of the data does leave some doubt that the first estimate of job creation in December, in particular the estimate that retail hiring declined by 20,000 during the holiday shopping season and a decline of 10,000 in trade and transport. Thus we think that there will be material upward revisions to the BLS estimate when the next monthly data is published. Outside of the two aforementioned categories, job creation was strong across the board."" But this jobs report was all about wages, and growth there remained lackluster. Year over year, earnings increased by around 2.5 percent. ""We expect a clear upturn over the first half of this year, but it isn't happening yet,"" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics. This mysterious lack of earnings growth has helped provide cover for Federal Reserve officials to slowly raise rates. So what does this mean to the Fed's rate plan? ""At the margin, this report reduces the odds of a March rate hike, but two more reports are due before the FOMC meeting, by which time these numbers will be ancient history,"" wrote Mr. Shepherdson. Fitbit is investing $6 million into Sano, which is developing a patch to track a person's blood sugar level, reported Christina Farr of CNBC. The move could help Fitbit reverse declining sales. Via CNBC: ""Building blood-sugar tracking into a future device could dramatically increase the market for Fitbit devices since more than 100 million Americans are now living with diabetes or pre-diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fitbit has recently suffered declining sales: It sold 3.6 million devices in the quarter ended Sept. 30, down from 5.3 million a year earlier. Keeping pace with Apple: Last month The New York Times reported that device manufacturers are tapping into new features on the Apple Watch to develop medical accessories. Apple is also looking for its own medical breakthroughs, such as a noninvasive continuous glucose reader, the NYT reported. David Tepper of Appaloosa Management thinks so, telling CNBC: ""Explain to me where this market is rich? It's not rich with the tax thing that just changed earnings projections. With earnings forecasts going up and interest rates where they are, how is this market expensive? I don't see the overvaluation. World growth is higher."" A dissenting voice: The market historian James Stack told Jim Stewart of the NYT: ""A correction would be healthy. The longer we go without one, the greater the risk this will end badly. A lot of people will get hurt."" The next thing to look out for: It's Jobs Friday today. A Reuters survey of economists expects the nonfarm payroll report to show a gain of 190,000 for December. Legal experts are poring over the question, after a report by Mike Schmidt of the NYT that President Trump told the White House's top lawyer to stop Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the Russia investigation. From Mr. Schmidt's story: Legal experts said that of the two primary issues Mr. Mueller appears to be investigating — whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice while in office and whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia — there is currently a larger body of public evidence tying the president to a possible crime of obstruction. But the experts are divided about whether the accumulated evidence is enough for Mr. Mueller to bring an obstruction case. About that Michael Wolff book:  ""Fire and Fury"" is to go on sale today, ahead of schedule — and despite legal threats from Mr. Trump. So a steady drip of excerpts — from Steve Bannon calling a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russians ""treasonous"" to the former adviser suggesting that money laundering charges were in the offing — is about to become a flood. The most damaging may be the book's descriptions of Mr. Trump's erratic behavior and of aides' private contempt for their boss. Many Washington reads are underway (you start in the index, looking for your name). The firestorm has also propelled Mr. Wolff from local media gadfly into national newsmaker. The fallout for Mr. Bannon: Rebekah Mercer, the adviser's longtime benefactor, disavowed him in a rare public statement. And Breitbart's board members have debated whether to oust him as the media organization's chairman, according to the WSJ, citing unnamed sources. About that money-laundering accusation: Tim O'Brien of Bloomberg View says that Mr. Bannon's allegation is as serious as any claim of ""treason."" The Washington flyaround • Mr. Trump may have dismantled his voter fraud commission, but he wasn't happy about it. (NYT) • Bipartisan talks on protecting the young immigrants known as Dreamers are starting to fray amid disagreements on a border wall and other immigration policies. (Politico) • Ajit Pai, the chairman of the F.C.C., canceled his speaking appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show, citing death threats, according to unnamed sources. (Recode) Already, its decision to let prosecutors more freely enforce federal law against the drug has taken its toll on publicly traded pot-related companies. • Shares in Scotts Miracle-Gro, whose C.E.O. has courted marijuana growers, dropped as much as 5 percent yesterday. • Those in Cannabis Sativa Inc., which produces edibles and other pot-related products, plunged 24 percent. • And shares in GrowGeneration, a cannabis farming company, fell 21 percent. It's a shocking turnaround, too. Cannabis-related shares had rallied this week as California began recreational marijuana sales. The response • Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, threatened to hold up Justice Department appointments. • The head of California's Bureau of Cannabis Control, Lori Ajax, said the state was legalizing as planned. Weekend pot reading: If you're a budding cannabis entrepreneur and need financing, you'll probably have to turn to a small credit union outside Denver. Yes, corporations like Apple will have to repatriate overseas earnings under the new code. And the tax analyst David Zion estimates that they will pay some $235 billion. But he also reckons that the new repatriation treatment alone is worth $500 billion more compared with the old law. And analysts in general think the overhaul will help corporate America. As J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova law professor, told Jesse Drucker of the NYT, multinationals have sought a change like this for over a decade: ""We wouldn't have the legislation if they didn't want it."" Energy companies, obviously. And the president of the National Ocean Industries Association, Randall Luthi, called the offshore leasing proposal ""bold and broad."" But investor reaction yesterday was fairly muted: American depositary receipts in Royal Dutch Shell and BP, for instance, each rose less than 1 percent. What the proposal will do From Lisa Friedman of the NYT: The plan would give the energy industry broad access to drilling rights in most parts of the outer continental shelf, including Pacific waters near California, Atlantic waters near Maine and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Interior Department Secretary Ryan Zinke had a simpler explanation: ""We're going to become the strongest energy superpower."" What it won't Immediately green-light drilling. Who's opposed Environmental activists, obviously. But also nearly a dozen governors, including the Republicans Chris Christie of New Jersey and Rick Scott of Florida. That is, if he follows through on his plan to sell about 29 percent of his stake in Uber to a group led by SoftBank, as Bloomberg reports. (We hear that the report is accurate.) What he stands to make: about $1.4 billion. More from Eric Newcomer of Bloomberg: Kalanick, who owns 10 percent of the company, had offered to sell as much as half of his stake — the maximum board members were allowed to tender. He had to pare back the amount because of limits outlined in the agreement between Uber and the buyers, the people said. The tech flyaround • Intel struggled for months to address Meltdown, one of two computer chip security flaws that came to light this week. Apple said that nearly all of its computing devices, including iPhones, were vulnerable and that it was issuing updates. (WSJ) • What you can do to protect your devices against the flaws. Briefly: Update! (NYT) • A close look at Iran's hackers, who have begun cyberespionage campaigns against the U.S. and others. (NYT) • China's internet users increasingly want privacy. Their government wants more data and more control. (NYT) • Mark Zuckerberg's 2018 personal goal: ""fix"" Facebook. He's also looking closely at encryption and digital currencies. (Reuters) • Don't rush to regulate A.I., Andrew Burt, the chief privacy officer of the data management company Inmuta, writes in an NYT Op-Ed. (NYT) A deal is reportedly close, according to the WSJ, citing unnamed people. But the eventual buyer is expected to pay less than $500 million, and shareholders like the Weinsteins, the advertising giant WPP and SoftBank could be wiped out. (Remember that Tom Barrack's Colony Capital had agreed to buy the embattled studio, but backed out.) Who's in the running, according to Ben Fritz and Keach Hagey of the WSJ: The bidders include a group led by businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet; production company Killer Content working with philanthropist Abigail Disney; studio Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.; and investment firms Vine Alternative Investments and Shamrock Capital Investments. The media flyaround  • Disney's proposed acquisition of Fox assets has raised questions about the future for Fox's television properties, including, ""Am I going to have to put Mickey Mouse in 'American Horror Story'?"" (NYT) • Newsroom employees at the L.A. Times began voting on unionization yesterday. (NYT) • H. Brandt Ayers, the former publisher of The Anniston Star in Alabama, resigned on Thursday as chairman of the newspaper's parent company after admitting to spanking a reporter in the 1970s. (NYT) • Jimmy Iovine will leave Apple in August, roughly four years after he and Dr. Dre sold Beats to the tech giant.

(Bloomberg) • Insurers are set to pay out a record $135 billion on losses from natural disasters in 2017, according to Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer.

News,2018-01-05,"In the 1950s, a pack of Camels could be had for as little as 25 cents in some parts of the country. But in New York City today, heavy taxes have pushed that price north of $13. Even adjusted for inflation, that’s more than a fivefold increase.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/business/economy/why-even-tougher-regulations-on-smoking-are-justified.html,975," In the 1950s, a pack of Camels could be had for as little as 25 cents in some parts of the country. But in New York City today, heavy taxes have pushed that price north of $13. Even adjusted for inflation, that's more than a fivefold increase. In the intervening years, we have also banned smoking in restaurants, bars and public buildings. Some jurisdictions have prohibited smoking even in outdoor public spaces. We have spent billions of dollars on media campaigns to discourage smoking. Given the longstanding American hostility to social engineering, each of these steps faced heavy pushback. When called on to justify them, regulators have offered their traditional response: Restricting individual freedom is often the only way to prevent undue harm to innocent bystanders. The specific harm cited has almost always been well-documented health hazards caused by secondhand smoke. This rationale is similar to the one for requiring catalytic converters on cars: We need them to prevent pollution that would otherwise cause undue harm to others. But unless you work in a crowded bar with no ventilation, the health risks from secondhand smoke are small compared with those from being a smoker. For example, more than 85 percent of American deaths from lung cancer are attributable to smoking, with fewer than one-third of the remainder linked to passive smoke exposure. Regulators may insist that their aim is not to protect smokers from themselves, but our regulations do vastly more to protect smokers (by inducing them to quit) than to protect bystanders. In fact, smoking also harms bystanders in a more important way: Each person who becomes a smoker makes it more likely that others will become smokers as well. This additional effect outweighs the harm caused by secondhand smoke by enough to suggest that our efforts to discourage smoking, strict as they seem, may not be nearly strict enough. Some are more sensitive than others to environmental influences. I have four adult sons, none of whom is a smoker. I once remarked to a friend that if they had grown up when I did, at least two of them would be. My son Chris, who was present during this conversation, immediately asked, ""Which two?"" ""David (my oldest) almost certainly would have been,"" I said, ""and Hayden (my youngest) probably would have been, too."" I added that Jason wouldn't have smoked no matter when he had been born. Chris seemed offended, insisting that he, too, probably would have become a smoker if he had grown up when I did. When I started smoking at age 14 in 1959, many of my friends had already been smoking for several years. My parents didn't want me to smoke, but as smokers themselves, they were poorly positioned to object. In those days, more than 60 percent of American men were smokers, and almost as many women. Smoking was just something that most people did. Yet even then, people who smoked did not seem happy about it. Today, roughly 90 percent of smokers say they regret having started, and about 80 percent express a desire to quit. Some 40 to 50 percent of smokers try to quit each year, but fewer than 5 percent of them succeed. Several of my own attempts to quit failed. So I count myself fortunate to have abandoned the habit before leaving home for college. The reason I succeeded in raising my children to be nonsmokers and my parents did not is that today's environment is very different from the earlier one. By far the most powerful predictor of whether a person will smoke is the percentage of her closest friends who smoke. If the share of smokers in someone's peer group rises to 30 percent from 20 percent, for example, the probability that she will smoke rises by about 25 percent. Whereas most of my teenage friends were smokers, relatively few of my sons' friends were. In 2016, only about 19 percent of American men were smokers, and only about 14 percent of women. Today's environment is different mostly because of the taxes and other regulatory measures we have taken to discourage smoking. Well and good, but does anyone think that still having more than one smoker in six people is a desirable population ratio? Our stated rationale for discouraging smoking — to prevent harm caused by secondhand smoke — greatly understates the amount of harm that these actions prevent. When a regulation results in one smoker fewer, every friend of that person will have one smoker fewer in her peer group. Every member of every one of those peer groups will then become less likely to smoke. And that, in turn, will make others less likely to smoke, and so on. Most people don't like being regulated, but even strict libertarians concede the legitimacy of regulations to prevent undue harm to others. As John Stuart Mill memorably wrote in ""On Liberty"": ""The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant."" Causing someone to be more likely to smoke clearly inflicts substantial harm on that person. I have never heard even the staunchest libertarian say, ""I hope my children grow up to be smokers."" Further discouraging smoking now will make it much easier to raise children to be nonsmokers. Evidence suggests that stricter measures to discourage smoking would make even smokers themselves happier. In a 2005 study, for example, the economists Jonathan Gruber and Sendhil Mullainathan found that people with a higher propensity to smoke were significantly happier in places with higher cigarette taxes. Higher taxes, they noted, made it easier for smokers to quit. Today's regulations to discourage smoking are strict, yes. But without violating libertarian sensibilities, we could adopt even stricter measures."

But this week, the possibility of offshore oil and gas drilling returned, and again has placed coastal business owners and residents in the position of defending their livelihoods. The Trump administration has released a draft plan that would open almost all United States waters to offshore oil and gas drilling from 2019 to 2024. This plan envisions a sweeping expansion of oil and gas exploration and drilling in the nation's outer continental shelf, about three nautical miles to as much as 200 miles offshore. The triple threat of seismic airgun blasting to find oil and gas below the ocean floor, coastal industrialization and inevitable oil spills would forever change the Atlantic tourist economy, where drilling has never taken place. These are some of the same areas where coastal residents fought down an Obama administration plan to permit oil and gas drilling off the mid- and southeastern Atlantic coast. And if expanding offshore drilling isn't bad enough, this plan follows a series of proposed  rollbacks announced by the administration last week of safety rules that were put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and caused the nation's worst oil spill. In effect, these rollbacks pave the way for another such disaster. This latest move from the Trump administration is a slap in the face for the hundreds of thousands of people who made their voices heard as President Obama considered opening up more coastal waters to drilling. President Trump's plan puts powerful fossil-fuel interests ahead of those of coastal businessmen and women. Over the last several years, thousands of Americans petitioned their local, state and federal governments to say no to seismic airgun blasting, which is damaging to marine life, and offshore drilling. They called, they signed petitions, wrote letters, went to city council meetings, held rallies and wrote op-ed essays and letters to the editor; some even traveled multiple times to Washington to meet with their representatives. I have met these people. They are from all parties. Many are Republicans. Many are business owners. Others are fishermen, veterans, faith leaders and even former oil industry leaders. They saw that their government respond to their concerns when the Obama administration removed the Arctic and Atlantic seaboards from its offshore drilling plan. In removing Atlantic coastal areas from the plan, the Obama administration cited ""significant potential conflicts with other ocean uses such as Department of Defense and commercial interests, current market dynamics, limited infrastructure, and opposition from many coastal communities."" The Trump administration seems to be ignoring the voices of those communities. Last year, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke promised to ""listen to state and local stakeholders"" as his department's reviewed offshore oil and gas. But this proposal plan tells America that so far, the only stakeholders this administration has listened to are industry lobbyists. Perhaps this will change. There will be a 60-day window for the public to comment on the Interior Department plan. In announcing the proposal, Mr. Zinke said, ""Just like with mining, not all areas are appropriate for offshore drilling, and we will take that into consideration in the coming weeks."" I hope he does. Oil interests are probably hoping that this new plan will discourage those who fought long and hard to protect their coast. But if I know anything about the people I've met over the last couple of years, they're not the type to be discouraged. And by expanding the threat of drilling to nearly all United States waters, this administration faces a tsunami of opposition from businesses, local leaders and activists on all our coasts. This offshore drilling proposal will be very real for many people who might not have been involved in politics before. They are getting involved now. The Trump administration may not have listened to state and local stakeholders yet, but soon the president won't be able to ignore the chorus of voices demanding that he keep offshore drilling out of the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans, and the eastern Gulf of Mexico."
Op-Ed,2018-01-06,"Last May an article in this newspaper asked, “Is Iran a democracy or a dictatorship?” After more than a week of protests in as many as 80 Iranian cities, it’s safe to say we have the answer. Again.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/opinion/finding-the-way-forward-on-iran.html,835," Last May an article in this newspaper asked, ""Is Iran a democracy or a dictatorship?"" After more than a week of protests in as many as 80 Iranian cities, it's safe to say we have the answer. Again. So much was apparent from the speed with which the demonstrations, initially about the rising price of eggs, morphed into calls for ""death to the dictator,"" complete with the burning of images of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. So much was apparent, too, from the force with which the regime cracked down on what it branded ""sedition."" Real democracies don't live in fear of their own people. It's too soon to say whether the protests have been stamped out, at least for now. But it's not too soon to start rethinking the way we think about Iran. For the most part, Western attention focuses on what Iran has — centrifuges, ballistic missiles, enriched uranium — as well as what it does — fund Hezbollah, assist Bashar al-Assad, arm the Houthis, or imprison the occasional British or American citizen. Administrations of both parties have spent most of their Iran energies trying to cajole or coerce Tehran to relinquish and desist, without much success. Not nearly enough attention, however, goes to the question of what Iran is. This isn't just about whether it's a dictatorship. What kind of dictatorship? To get the answer right is to know what kind of pressure can change its behavior or break its back. The conventional wisdom is that it's a dictatorship with democratic characteristics, and that it's riven between hard-liners who want to make it more repressive and militant and reformists who want to make it less. Western policy, according to this analysis, should do what it can to encourage and reward the latter at the expense of the former. But the analysis fails to explain why, for instance, the number of executions in Iran rose under the ostensibly reformist leadership of President Hassan Rouhani. It doesn't account for Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif laying a wreath in honor of Imad Mugniyeh, the Hezbollah terrorist responsible for killing hundreds of Americans. And it doesn't explain Tehran's hyperaggressive foreign policy in the wake of the 2015 nuclear deal, which was supposed to inaugurate its opening to the rest of the world. A better way of describing Iran's dictatorship is as a kleptotheocracy, driven by impulses that are by turns doctrinal and venal. Note how quickly the provincial protesters turned their sights on the supreme leader: Maybe it's because they know better than most how thoroughly he's fleecing them. As Steve Stecklow and his colleagues at Reuters reported in 2013, a supposedly charitable foundation controlled by Khamenei, known as Setad, had assets worth an estimated $95 billion. ""Setad built its empire on the systematic seizure of thousands of properties belonging to ordinary Iranians,"" the Reuters investigation noted. ""The organization now holds a court-ordered monopoly on taking property in the name of the supreme leader, and regularly sells the seized properties at auction or seeks to extract payments from the original owners."" What's true of Setad goes for other tax-exempt bonyad, multibillion-dollar ""charities"" run chiefly for the benefit of their clerical masters. It's true as well of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, estimated to control another 15 percent of the Iranian economy. One of the reasons why easing sanctions on Iran was never likely to soften the regime is that the people who stood to gain from commercial ties with foreign companies are the same people most invested in the preservation of the regime and its system of preferences. There's no trickle-down economy in the Islamic Republic. But it also means that the kleptotheocracy is uniquely vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy. All Islamist movements take the concept of justice (as opposed to freedom) as their organizing political concept, and all of them ignore it at their peril. The Iranian regime's problem is that it has spent nearly 40 years making its hypocrisy plain to all of its people, save those who profit from it. This is an opportunity for the free world to exploit. Ken Weinstein of the Hudson Institute has argued that the U.S. government ""should release details on the billions in stolen assets"" held by the I.R.G.C. and the supreme leader. That — and making sure ordinary Iranians learn about them, one scandalous disclosure at a time — is the right idea. Another right idea, this one from Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, is to once again put Setad, along with its scores of front companies and subsidiaries, under U.S. sanctions for corruption. The Obama administration did such a thing in 2013, only to reverse course as part of the nuclear deal. In 1982, Ronald Reagan praised Poland's Solidarity movement for remaining ""magnificently unreconciled to oppression."" Turns out, it's true of Iranians today. A West that wants to help them can begin by exploiting the internal contradiction that defines the regime that oppresses them and which may yet prove its undoing."
News,2018-01-06,"NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico — Raúl García Miranda wants Carlos Flores’s job. Mr. Flores doesn’t think he deserves it.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/business/economy/nafta-border-truckers.html,1863," NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico — Raúl García Miranda wants Carlos Flores's job. Mr. Flores doesn't think he deserves it. The two men haul goods that travel from Mexico into the United States. Both come from a Mexican border town infested with drug cartels. But Mr. Flores got out. He became a United States citizen, giving him the right to drive through the American heartland and earn good money delivering washing machines and broccoli sent from Mexico. Mr. Miranda, a Mexican national, doesn't have that option. He can make only short trips, back and forth across the border, from a lot on the southern side to truck lots 24 miles to the north. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed in 1993, the United States agreed to eventually let drivers like Mr. Miranda deposit their cargoes anywhere. Then the union representing truckers revolted, staging protests at the border and pressuring the White House to abandon the idea.  So ensued a decades-long cage match, waged by American truckers, clinging to a stronghold of blue-collar work, and their Mexican counterparts, desperate to claim territory they had been promised. In 2015, the Obama administration finally allowed Mexican drivers to seek permission to travel beyond pockets of land along the border. Only a handful now do so. But the fight has entered a new round, with an American president who has shown a special fondness for truckers and their big rigs. The Trump administration has thrown its America First agenda behind the cause in the Nafta negotiations, demanding that Mexico agree to a provision that could, in the future, block its drivers from making deliveries into the middle of the United States. Mexico has rejected that suggestion outright, challenging the fairness of shielding a slice of laborers from low-paid foreign competitors, in a trade deal meant to allow most everything to flow freely across borders. The dispute offers a window into the stakes involved in rewriting, or blowing up, an agreement that has become highly contentious but also extremely lucrative for all sides. It also hints at the impact that market forces — more than rules agreed to on paper — may have on the ways two nations exchange wares. More than $525 billion in goods travel between the United States and Mexico in a year, and most come on trucks. The tension over who gets to profit off that flow can be boiled down to the handoff, from a Mexican to an American, of 64 refrigerators destined for Texas. The journey began on a recent Thursday at a lot in northern Mexico, distinguished by a taco truck and not much else. A group of drivers, all men, formed a line outside a dispatch window at Fema, one of Mexico's largest trucking companies, waiting to find out what they'd be lugging into America. Someone else had brought the trailer filled with LG refrigerators to this spot. Mr. Miranda's job was to take them across the border to a lot in Laredo. He travels this route multiple times a day. The work is rote, but never-ending. Mr. Miranda works up to 18 hours a day, six days a week. ""I lost my family because of this work,"" Mr. Miranda said. He is 36, with a thinning hairline, but could pass for a teenager when he smiles. He has the plaintive look of a man who has spent years appeasing heavily armed men at border checkpoints. This town, Nuevo Laredo, sits just below Texas and right above an area in central Mexico that foreign car and aircraft makers transformed into an international manufacturing hub over the last 30 years.  As trade between Mexico and the United States exploded in the wake of Nafta, new career paths emerged for men like Mr. Miranda. When he took the job, his idea was to pay off the loan on his house and save up enough to send his young son to school. As it turned out, his job took him away from home so much that his wife asked for a separation a few months after he started. His family lives in town, but he worries about how his son is handling growing up in a home with only one parent. ""I didn't think it would be such a sacrifice,"" Mr. Miranda said. Each time he crosses the border, the trucking company pays him around $12, he said. On a good day, he can make the trip four times. When traffic piles up, he can go only once. The line that Mr. Miranda endures on his way into the United States can last more than three hours. A red light flashed as he passed through the border. ""Bad news,"" he said. He had been randomly picked for an inspection at the Customs and Border Protection checkpoint. Normally, even after the border wait, the inspection alone takes three hours. Drivers waiting their turn sprawl out on spartan benches and tables, blistering in the heat. While agents in an air-conditioned office pored over an ultrasound of the inside of his truck, and riffled through his documents, Mr. Miranda stood and watched. The conversation eventually turned to President Trump, for whom Mr. Miranda has a measure of respect. ""He has good things and bad things,"" he said. ""He's protecting his country on the one hand, but he's also making relations bad."" Mr. Miranda got the clearance to head north. He set off on a 20-minute drive to Werner Enterprises, a giant in American freight. When he arrived at the terminal, a pristine repository for shiny blue tractors, he backed his 53-foot trailer ever so gently into an open slot, unhooked his cab and drove off. He dreams of trucking across Texas, through Oklahoma, all the way to Michigan. His weekly pay, he reckons, would triple. ""We are all waiting for a deal where we can drive into the U.S.,"" he said. ""There's a lot of hope."" It might seem more efficient to hire Mr. Miranda to take the refrigerators directly to their final destination. For 20 years, though, the Teamsters union persuaded lawmakers to stop Mexican trucks from driving beyond parcels of land that hug the border from California to Texas. The union and its ally, an association for independent drivers, argued that Mexican truckers would cause fatal accidents, pollute the air with old big rigs and steal jobs from Americans. When President Barack Obama ended the moratorium in 2015, almost nothing changed. Only 38 Mexican carriers were authorized to make deliveries past the border zone, with fewer than 500 drivers — Mr. Miranda not among them. By comparison, more than 30,000 Americans haul Nafta goods from Mexico and Canada. Derek J. Leathers, the chief executive of Werner Enterprises, said there was little appetite among Mexican trucking companies. ""Mexican carriers by and large do not have a burning desire for their trucks and drivers to deliver into the U.S.,"" he said. ""It's a special environment with special expertise required."" Insurance providers charge Mexican carriers higher rates, as they do with any driver lacking a track record on American roads, trucking officials say. There is a constellation of American rules and regulations that don't exist in Mexico. The truckers have to speak some English. And there often isn't anything for Mexican drivers to take back after they drop their trailers off. The United States buys more from Mexican companies than it sells to them. Like foreign airlines, Mexican truckers can't take things between two American locations; they can only go in and out. Returning with an empty trailer means there's probably no shipper paying for that leg of the journey. The fight to keep Mexicans out by law is senseless, Mr. Leathers said, because the market is already weighted against them. ""It's a whole lot of debate and a whole lot of political rhetoric around something that neither side has an interest in doing,"" he said. That hasn't convinced American truckers or their advocates, who have seen what happened to factory jobs and refuse to trust politicians or executives who tell them that all will be well. All the economic obstacles standing in the way of an onslaught of Mexican drivers can be overcome with enough money, they say. ""I could see some private equity group saying: 'Let's buy a trucking company. Let's exploit Nafta,'"" said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon. ""'We are going to enhance the value of this asset by firing all the American workers and replacing them with $2.50-an-hour Mexican drivers.'"" At Werner Enterprises, Mr. Flores hopped into his tractor as soon as he got the word from his bosses. He wove his way through the parking lot, stopping at the trailer that Mr. Miranda had just abandoned and linking it to his cab. He was heading for San Antonio, with the sun setting and spilling blood orange onto the horizon. Mr. Flores's truck blared with an alarm that he couldn't turn off. He turned up the classic rock on the radio to drown out the sound. ""I don't think that's cool that those guys can just come with no papers,"" Mr. Flores said. ""They don't have to pay for training. They don't have to pay for citizenship like me. They come over here and are laughing at us. It's unfair."" When Mr. Flores started driving for Werner, as an employee, he worked himself to the ground and earned a fat paycheck. He spent three weeks on the road, driving from Texas to Canada and back, sleeping at truck stops in between. He would then return for a weekend in Brownsville, Tex., to see his wife and children. Then one day, his 7-year-old daughter's legs swelled up and she stopped walking. A specialist in Houston diagnosed angioedema, an uncurable disease involving swelling of deep layers of skin. Mr. Flores decided to take on a shorter route so that he could spend more time at home. ""When something like that happens, you don't care about making money,"" he said. Now 55, he lives with his family in San Antonio and works as an owner-operator, meaning he bought his truck but has to cover the hefty cost of maintaining it. He doesn't have a personal beef with the trucker who brought the trailer here, he said. Mr. Flores has never met Mr. Miranda, but he, too, was born in Nuevo Laredo. In 1991, he moved to Brownsville and got married. He and his wife earned money by baking and selling traditional Mexican cakes outside offices. It took him a decade to get his citizenship and cost $1,000 for lawyers and fees. It may sound strange that an immigrant like him wants to keep Mexicans off his route. But Mr. Flores sees himself as an American who earned the right to this work. One in every five people in the business of transportation is an immigrant, according to the Pew Research Center. ""Those guys just want to come here, make their money and go home,"" Mr. Flores said. ""I spend my money here. I bought my house. I pay my taxes."" With that, Mr. Flores pulled up to the final checkpoint these refrigerators would pass through that day before winding up in San Antonio. It is the line that Mexican drivers can't cross without a permit — the end of the border zone. An officer held a hand up. ""American citizens?"" The question barely lingered. ""Yes,"" Mr. Flores said, before maneuvering his truck onto the highway, on his way home."
Question,2018-01-06,"The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/reader-center/marijuana-laws.html,1727," The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, long a vocal opponent of the legalization of marijuana, rescinded on Thursday an Obama-era policy that discouraged federal prosecution of marijuana-related crimes in states that had legalized the drug. The announcement came just days after the first retail cannabis shops opened in California, the sixth state to legalize recreational marijuana use. As the tug of war between state and federal authorities continues, we asked readers for their questions about marijuana policy. Two of our reporters — Thomas Fuller, our San Francisco bureau chief, and Charlie Savage, a Washington correspondent — answered some of the 700 questions we received. The questions have been condensed and edited for clarity. What is the federal policy? How will it affect state legalization movements?   What do the federal laws against marijuana actually say? — Rick Goldberg In the Controlled Substances Act, Congress made it generally illegal ""to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance."" There are a range of criminal penalties and restrictions depending on factors like the quantity involved, and how the government has categorized that substance. For years, advocates of cannabis legalization have unsuccessfully urged the federal government to remove marijuana from its Schedule I listing — the category of drugs deemed to be the most potentially harmful and addictive and to lack medicinal value. Others in that category include heroin. — Charlie Savage Are federal prosecutors free to ignore this? I see the word ""discretion"" in every article — presumably they can use their discretion to pursue other things instead. Is this at all likely? — David Dyte, Brooklyn, N.Y. In theory, United States attorneys in federal districts around the country have discretion to continue to focus their resources elsewhere and to not bring marijuana cases. It remains to be seen how President Trump's Justice Department will handle the new policy in practice. — Charlie Savage What is California's policy? Will it be enforced statewide? What are the top differences in California law versus federal law? — Jessica, New Jersey This is an issue in which federal law and state law are completely at odds. The federal government considers marijuana a drug with high potential for abuse and no medicinal value. It puts marijuana in the same category as heroin under the Controlled Substances Act. California, by contrast, made marijuana legal for medical purposes in 1996. And on New Year's Day the sale of recreational marijuana became legal. So there is zero common ground between federal and state law. — Thomas Fuller Doesn't federal law supersede California state law? — Warren N. Miller, Boise, Idaho Both essentially exist in parallel. State statutes govern what sorts of crimes local and state law enforcement officials — like city police and district attorneys — can arrest and prosecute people for, while federal statutes govern the same for federal agents and United States attorneys. In practice, marijuana crimes have largely been handled at the state level. — Charlie Savage Can individual cities in California refuse to allow marijuana dispensaries to operate? And will cities see any of the tax revenue from sales? What specific actions will California take to oppose Mr. Sessions's marijuana stance? — Marissa Pinching, Long Beach, Calif. California law gives cities and counties wide latitude on marijuana regulations. The Board of Supervisors in Kern County voted in October to ban any marijuana-related activity, both cultivation and sale. Cities and counties that do allow marijuana businesses get a share of the tax revenue generated from local sales. — Thomas Fuller What form of ID is generally required to purchase recreational marijuana (specifically in California)? I have read that state driver's licenses are standard. But what about out-of-state visitors, foreigners, etc.? — Chris Larson, Switzerland I reached out to Daniel Yi, the head of communications at MedMen, a company with a chain of dispensaries in Southern California. He said they accept ""any official government issued photo ID, including foreign passports."" — Thomas Fuller What do Congress, the Supreme Court and the IRS have to say about it?  How much tax revenue could be generated if the federal government legalized the sale of marijuana nationwide? — Kevin Atkins, Jackson, Tenn. Let's start with Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana sales. Cannabis tax revenues are well above the state's initial estimates and now exceed alcohol tax receipts. The Colorado Department of Revenue recorded almost $194 million in taxes from cannabis sales in 2016. Alcohol taxes brought in a fraction of that, $44 million, according to the department's annual report. Cannabis also brought in more in tax revenue than cigarette taxes, at $162 million. How does this translate to a national level? The Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank, calculated in a 2016 report that legalization could generate up to $28 billion in taxes at the federal, state and local levels. Their calculation for federal revenues is $7 billion. But all of this seems somewhat pie-in-the-sky; the more aggressive stance toward the drug by Mr. Sessions indicates that national legalization is not coming anytime soon. — Thomas Fuller What does research say about the benefit and harm of marijuana use? As far as I know, tobacco and alcohol may be far more harmful. Is the alcohol and tobacco industry paying politicians to not legalize marijuana because it could potentially be a competitor? Does the industrial-prison complex have anything to do with this? — Tom Tim, Chicago There's a Catch-22 here. Determining a drug's efficacy requires a well-established system of clinical trials. But research on marijuana has been very limited in the United States because the federal government considers cannabis dangerous and of no medical value. Opinions on the health effects of cannabis can be quite polarized. A study in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry found that marijuana was more addictive than alcohol but less than tobacco. Some experts believe that legalization is inevitable but that marijuana should be treated more like tobacco than alcohol — in other words, people should be encouraged to stop using the drug. Marijuana proponents point out that we hear a lot about people dying from opioid and alcohol abuse, including those who die in alcohol-related car crashes, but we don't hear such things about marijuana. Last year, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine took a stab at answering the big questions about marijuana and health. It released a study that said there is conclusive evidence that marijuana helped in the treatment of chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and muscle spasms related to multiple sclerosis. There was moderate evidence that it helped people with insomnia. The dangers? There was substantial evidence, the report said, of a link between pregnant women smoking marijuana and lower birth weights. The report said driving under the influence of cannabis is dangerous and that there was moderate evidence of a correlation between cannabis and ""impairment in the cognitive domains of learning, memory, and attention."" The report's first recommendation: We need more research. — Thomas Fuller How much do you estimate that California will collect in terms of tax revenue directly from the sale of recreational marijuana in California? — Harry Solomon, Naples, Fla. Cannabis customers in Oakland are paying around 38 percent tax on their purchases. In San Jose it's around 35 percent. So a large chunk of legal marijuana sales are going into state coffers. In November 2016, when voters passed Proposition 64, the ballot initiative that legalized recreational marijuana, they were told that legalization would provide tax revenues ""ranging from high hundreds of millions of dollars to over $1 billion annually."" The ballot summary also said legalization would reduce criminal justice costs by tens of millions of dollars a year. It's too early to say whether these estimates were accurate. Only around 100 dispensaries were open in California on New Year's Day but many more are expected to open in the coming weeks and months. One of the first measures of tax revenues will come in May when the California Board of Equalization will release data on first-quarter cannabis collection. Stay tuned. — Thomas Fuller How will California's new law affect the environment and the state's small cannabis growers?  I read an article about detrimental effects to the environment from cannabis cultivation, especially damage to public lands and wildlife in California. Will legalization (and regulation) improve the situation? — David Warren, Roswell, Ga. The environmental effects have been severe in some parts of the state. A study published in 2015 by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife determined that marijuana gardens had depleted a number of creeks and streams during the dry season, imperiling salmon and trout in the waterways. The study relied on satellite images of marijuana gardens in the remote areas of Mendocino and Humboldt Counties. Marijuana is a thirsty plant, consuming as much as six gallons of water a day, about twice as much as wine grapes. Will legalization improve the situation? That's an open question. Growers who become part of the legalized system must abide by strict environmental regulations. But only around 10 percent of growers have signed up to join the system so far according to Hezekiah Allen, the executive director of the California Growers Association. The big question for California regulators is what they are going to do about the 90 percent who continue to grow in the black market. — Thomas Fuller What effects will California's decision to allow large corporate interests to participate in the marijuana markets have on smaller organizations and individuals just getting started in the business? — Richard Buford, Santa Barbara, Calif. This is a major concern for small-scale cannabis cultivators of marijuana in California. When Proposition 64 passed there was a moratorium on large-scale farming. But California's Department of Food and Agriculture removed those limits in November, leading to predictions of a consolidation of the industry. Critics say the cannabis industry in California, which for decades was made up of mostly small growers, could end up looking like the alcohol or tobacco industries. On the other hand, the continued federal ban of the drug could discourage large, publicly traded companies from taking part in the industry. — Thomas Fuller"
Op-Ed,2018-01-06,"Iranians complain about the economy. They always have.

But the numbers aren’t all that bad.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/opinion/irans-protesters-want-one-thing-accountability.html,1123," Iranians complain about the economy. They always have. I heard these complaints every time I visited Iran between 2004 and 2012, and I heard them from both middle-class people and the working poor. That Iranians complain about the economy was also something economists told me: People complain, they said, because they complain. But the numbers aren't all that bad. I never found this assurance very satisfying. The complaints I heard in those days were about missing paychecks, skyrocketing real estate and the price of meat. You could quote numbers about economic growth or declining poverty all you liked. It didn't change people's experience. Iranians expected better than they got. For that matter, Iranians complain about their political system, too. Regional experts will tell you that Iran is not as oppressive or as violent as some of its neighbors. The very fact that Iranians can complain is evidence of this. But Iran is still oppressive, and if you were there, you would instantly know it. Iran is an uncomfortable country, and the impulse to separate the economic from the political malaise risks missing the point. The problems are intertwined — never more so than when economic outcry is met with violent crackdown, as has been the case since protests began on Dec. 28. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the clerical establishment under the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, are the enforcers of political repression as well as the beneficiaries of an economy that has underperformed for everyone else. This fact is surely not lost on demonstrators who object to a budget by calling for an end to the regime. Today's protesters, we are told, come largely from the lower classes and are motivated by economic rage. The nuclear deal, with its promise of sanctions relief that never fully materialized, did not alleviate the longstanding unemployment problem. The 2018 budget — released last month and cobbled together from President Hassan Rouhani's neoliberal agenda and Ayatollah Khamenei's clerical fiat — revealed in stark terms the regime's spending on religious institutions and foreign adventures, even alongside cuts in cash dispersals and increases in fuel prices, and at a time when many provinces face drought and environmental degradation. Accounts of elite self-dealing and embezzlement repeatedly scandalize the public. Maybe these things all add up on the same ledger; maybe they don't. But many Iranians understand that their country has resources their families never see. Taking to the streets is a high-risk activity in Iran. So it is all the more notable that for the first time people are demonstrating without any purchase on the country's political establishment. On the contrary: Even reformist politicians have chastised these protesters and suggested they are serving foreign masters. The protesters, in turn, do not spare any political faction their ire. By contrast, in 1999 and 2009 popular protests were largely orchestrated through the reformist faction, an affiliation that provided the demonstrators with leadership, a civil rights agenda that didn't overflow the bounds of the Constitution, and tactical limits that protesters could breach only at their risk. This current round of protests, by all accounts, are bound by none of these constraints. They reportedly began as a hard-line assault on Mr. Rouhani but quickly acquired an independent momentum and spontaneously spread. There are no leaders to imprison or publicly humiliate, no democratic agenda to tar by association with Western values and no reason for protesters to avoid disruptive tactics or slogans that antagonize the entire ruling system. These demonstrations don't pit elites against one another but citizens against the state. Some of the people I know who were active in the 2009 uprising profess to be frightened today — of chaos and the potential for destructive demagogy. Others call for unity in opposition. If there is one thing Americans should know by now about Iran, it is how little we know it. The Iranian regime, with its heavy-handed censorship and self-isolation, has made sure of this. So has the pitched battle over American foreign policy on Iran, which renders Iran's domestic realities as talking points in a conversation that is really about us. There is an almost embarrassing cone of silence around today's protesters. They live in provincial cities, Tehran reformists don't speak for them and they are not the sorts of people connected with the domestic or international news media. Moreover, their likely demographic has been subject to casual generalizations that turn out to be wrong. For instance, the conventional wisdom inside and outside Iran has long held that the lower and working classes in Iran were clients of the state and the core hard-line constituency. Kevan Harris, a sociologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, conducted a study of welfare recipients and political affiliation that called this assumption into question. It turns out that loyalty is not so easily bought. Welfare recipients are not more politically predictable than other Iranians. And now it seems that when members of this cohort turn up on Iran's streets, after years of being told that there is nothing wrong with an economy that can't keep factory doors open or food on the table, their slogans are more radical than those of the presumptive middle class. Ayatollah Khamenei, for his part, has spent these days of rage composing anti-American tweets, warning of an American plot to dismember the country and comparing President Trump unfavorably with Ronald Reagan. This is both deflection and political savvy. Nationalism is a powerful current in Iranian life, and Mr. Trump is offering Ayatollah Khamenei the gift of a credible straw man — with alacrity, it seems. But American sound and fury mainly serve to obfuscate a domestic quandary. Every decade or so in Iran, protests erupt whose scale, intensity and persistence make global headlines. The ideological punditry flows. We read that the regime is universally hated and about to fall, and then we read that the regime is strong and the oppositionists are marginal people of no account — because, in 2009, they were predominantly middle class, or because, in 2018, they are not. Security forces crack down, the regime doesn't fall, and dissent remains stalwart and pervasive. A political scientist once told me that Iran is the exception that proves the rule: It's the textbook example of the country that meets every precondition for democratic transition but still refuses to change. Iranian protests repeatedly come down to one thing: the accountability of the regime to its people. But Ayatollah Khamenei has buttered his bread on the other side. His power depends on the continued stranglehold of the security state, which he has also made the country's economic center of gravity. So long as this is true, he can't or won't address the root cause of Iran's chronic unrest."
News,2018-01-06,"OXFORD, England — From the comfort of his country estate in Oxford, a distant relative of the Russian literary giant Tolstoy says he has the perfect solution for what ails the United States.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/world/europe/monarchy-us-advantage.html,1436," OXFORD, England — From the comfort of his country estate in Oxford, a distant relative of the Russian literary giant Tolstoy says he has the perfect solution for what ails the United States. America, he declares, needs a monarchy. In fact, Count Nikolai Tolstoy says, more kings, queens and all the frippery that royalty brings would be not just a salve for a superpower in political turmoil, but also a stabilizing force for the world at large. ""I love the monarchy,"" Count Tolstoy, 82, said as he sat in his lush garden behind an expansive stone house. ""Most people think the monarchy is just decorative and filled with splendor and personalities. They do not appreciate the important ideological reasons for a monarchy."" The count is not the only voice advocating rule by royalty. An author and a conservative politician who holds dual British and Russian citizenship, he leads the International Monarchist League and is part of a loose confederation of monarchists scattered across the globe, including in the United States. Their core arguments: Countries with monarchies are better off because royal families act as a unifying force and a powerful symbol; monarchies rise above politics; and nations with royalty are generally richer and more stable. Critics say such views are antiquated and alarming in an era when democracies around the globe appear to be imperiled. The count and his band of fellow monarchists, however, are determined to make their case at conferences, in editorials and at fancy balls. A recent study that examined the economic performance of monarchies versus republics bolsters their views. Led by Mauro F. Guillén, a management professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, the study found ""robust and quantitatively meaningful evidence"" that monarchies outperform other forms of government. Far from being a dying system, the study said, ""monarchies are surprisingly prevalent around the world."" They provide a ""stability that often translates into economic gains""; they are better at protecting property rights and checking abuses of power by elected officials; and they have higher per-capita national incomes, the study said. Mr. Guillén says he was ""shocked"" by the results, which have not yet been published. ""Most people think monarchies are something anachronistic,"" he said. ""They think that modern forms of government are superior and have trouble accepting that monarchies have advantages."" When he presents his findings, ""there is more skepticism in the room than with the average paper,"" said Mr. Guillén, who is not a monarchist. ""It's been an uphill battle."" His findings come as no surprise, however, to monarchists, who aim to preserve existing monarchies and to support royals who live in exile. They believe that countries with exiled royals should return them to the throne, and that nations without monarchies should consider a switch. ""We support the retention and restoration of monarchies anywhere in the world,"" Count Tolstoy said. ""Our goal is to persuade people."" History books, of course, are replete with examples of monarchies that became symbols of repression and rapacious, cloistered wealth. Some were ousted by bloody rebellions (the American and French Revolutions) or collapsed in ruins (the Hapsburg Empire), and many have ruthlessly marginalized whole classes of people. But Count Tolstoy insists that monarchists are not pining for the days of absolute rulers and the divine right of kings, when Henry VIII of England could order up the execution of unwanted wives and political foes. Instead, his group advocates constitutional monarchies, in which a king or queen is head of state and the real power rests with an elected Parliament — much like those in Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain (although demonstrators in 2014 demanded a referendum on the Spanish royal family after King Juan Carlos abdicated). All of those countries, the monarchists note, have relatively strong economies. Mr. Guillén's study shows that since 1900, 22 countries have abandoned royal leaders, while 35 others adopted them. Forms of constitutional monarchies took root, at least for some time, in emerging economies like Malaysia and Thailand. Still, the study noted that some current monarchies lack basic democratic freedoms, including in Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Swaziland. After the Arab Spring, some analysts noted that monarchies like Morocco, Jordan and the Gulf States demonstrated much more stability than countries like Iraq, Libya and Egypt. But Sean L. Yom, a political-science professor at Temple University who studies Middle Eastern governments, said that stability might be fleeting: With some of those monarchies propped up by oil money rather than a love of any royal family, ""monarchies are on their way out,"" Mr. Yom said. ""Those surviving in the Middle East are the very lucky survivors of history, and it is just taking more time,"" he said. ""These countries look so good only because their neighbors look so bad."" Finding people to reject the monarchists' vision is not hard, even in Britain, where Queen Elizabeth II is revered by many. A London-based grass-roots organization called Republic, which wants the country to hold a referendum on the monarchy when the queen dies, says bluntly on its website, ""The monarchy isn't fit for purpose. It is corrupt and secretive."" The group has a clear mandate: ""We want to see the monarchy abolished and the queen replaced with an elected democratic head of state,"" it says. Graham Smith, Republic's chief executive, said that current polls showed about 20 to 25 percent of Britons to be anti-royalty, and that it had been hard to win broader support. ""Our job is to keep raising that number,"" he said, adding that ""public opinion takes time to shift."" As for the Monarchist League, Mr. Smith dismisses it as ""a crank organization."" He said: ""They are going against the general direction of history. You cannot just pluck a family out of obscurity and put them in charge of a country."" Count Tolstoy acknowledges that the International Monarchist League had turned into a ""league of eccentrics"" under its former chancellor, Victor Hervey, who had been jailed for a jewel heist, worked as an arms dealer and sought tax exile in Monaco. It was founded in 1943 on the belief that the monarchies of Eastern Europe could be a bulwark against Soviet expansion. Count Tolstoy took over in the mid-1980s, and says the current members are ""sensible, run-of-the-mill people."" Count Tolstoy has written books on ancient and postwar British history. He has also run, unsuccessfully, as a parliamentary candidate for the far-right U.K. Independence Party in four general elections. When he considers the United States, Count Tolstoy is certain it would be better off without a presidency. ""There is an alternative,"" he wrote in an opinion article for The New York Times before the 2016 election. He noted that neither candidate ""appears to be a Washington or a Lincoln,"" and pointed to a neighbor as an example: Canada, he wrote, ""demonstrates that democracy is perfectly compatible with constitutional monarchy."" "" But being an American monarchist can be a tough sell. The country, after all, was born of rebellion against a British king. Charles A. Coulombe of Los Angeles, a former stand-up comic and a monarchist, said, ""If you say you are a monarchist, there is a strain of disloyalty or treason."" There are no reliable estimates of how many monarchists there are in the United States. But to help disseminate their message, a Washington think tank, the Center for the Study of Monarchy, Traditional Governance and Sovereignty, opened this past year. American monarchists also find ways to help the cause abroad. Thomas R. Hutson, a retired State Department diplomat who was posted in Belgrade, has been advocating the restoration of Alexander, the crown prince of Yugoslavia, as the monarch of Serbia. On his own dime, Mr. Hutson has repeatedly traveled to Serbia to promote the prince, who was born in exile in London and later moved to Belgrade. But Mr. Hutson admits that he is making little headway. ""I tell people I'm a monarchist and the conversation lasts three seconds,"" he said. ""There is resoundingly no interest in him coming back as king. It's a generational thing. The monarchy completely goes by young people who lack of a sense of history."" He insists, however: ""I'm not giving up."" The Rev. Canon Kenneth W. Gunn-Walberg, the rector of St. Mary's Anglican Church in Wilmington, Del., and leader of the Monarchist League's chapter for the Eastern states, said the appeal of monarchies was simple. ""There is style, a mystery and ethos with a monarch,"" he said. ""Presidents come and go. There's continuity, a sense of history with a monarchy."""
News,2018-01-06,"SURAT, India — The immense popularity of Narendra Modi, India’s most dynamic prime minister in decades, has always rested on two legs: Hindu nationalism and his tantalizing promises to build on the country’s go-go economy.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/world/asia/india-modi-economy.html,1859," SURAT, India — The immense popularity of Narendra Modi, India's most dynamic prime minister in decades, has always rested on two legs: Hindu nationalism and his tantalizing promises to build on the country's go-go economy. That second leg is now looking a little shaky. In the last two years, India's consumer confidence has plummeted, construction has slowed, the fixed investment rate has fallen, many factories have shut down and unemployment has gone up. Fingers are pointing at Mr. Modi. Just about all economists agree that two of the prime minister's biggest policy gambles — abruptly voiding most of the nation's currency and then, less than a year later, imposing a sweeping new sales tax — have slowed India's meteoric growth. ""Things have been worsening, worsening, worsening,"" said Himanshu, an economics professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, who uses only one name. Still, the economy here is far from failing. The stock market continues to soar, major rail, road and port projects are unfolding across the country, and foreign investors poured $25.4 billion into India from April to September, up 17 percent from the period in 2016. The government on Friday predicted that the country's gross domestic product would grow by 6.5 percent in the 2017-18 financial year. While that is the lowest number the country has seen in four years, India's economy is one that most countries would love to have. But it does not feel that way to the huge number of Indians negatively affected by Mr. Modi's policies, and the grumbles are growing. So are social tensions, especially those that divide Hindus from Muslims, and upper caste from lower caste. The fear is that Mr. Modi is already beginning to lean more heavily on that first leg of his, Hindu nationalism, now that his economic strategy is losing some of its sheen. With 1.3 billion people, India is the world's most populous democracy. In 10 years, economic forecasters predict that India's economy will climb to third-largest in the world, behind only the United States and China. What happens here matters, and domestically, confidence is strained. How does the election work? Will Modi win? What are the main issues facing India and its 900 million voters? Even in Gujarat, the state considered the strongest of Mr. Modi's strongholds, where people have been cheering his rise for the past 20 years and line up in dusty fields by the thousands just to catch a glimpse of his saffron scarf and groomed white beard, many feel betrayed. The output from the textile industry, a huge employer here and once a healthy exporter, has been cut nearly in half, prompting layoffs and despair. In many of the industrial areas, the happiest merchants are the merchants of scrap, who make their rounds in lurching trucks, scooping up looms, steel spools and other underused machinery for pennies on the dollar. In December, in an election that the entire country was watching because it was seen as a referendum on Mr. Modi's governance, Gujarati voters elected a new State Assembly. Mr. Modi's party maintained its majority but lost 16 seats. The message was clear: Mr. Modi's party was still No. 1, but the man himself was no longer bulletproof. ""Modi hurt our business, and we want to show him that we can hurt him, too,"" said Manish Patel, whose once clackety cloth factory is now completely empty, another Gujarati business that has gone under. Mr. Patel complained that under Mr. Modi, ""It was like we were in first class and now we've been put in 10th class."" So for the first time in his life, Mr. Patel voted for the Indian National Congress, the leading opposition party, not for the Bharatiya Janata Party of Mr. Modi. Here in Surat, a Gujarati metropolis with hundreds of years of storied mercantile history, Mr. Modi's currency policy hit like a sledgehammer. It was November 2016, and when Mr. Modi abruptly announced that large denomination rupee notes were invalid and being replaced with new currency, panic erupted. Manish Patel and his older brother, Dilip, who run the family's cloth business, found themselves scurrying into line at the bank and waiting hours each day, trying to get money. It was never enough, and when the brothers could not pay their loom operators, many walked off. Hundreds of factories had the same problem. The Surat textile traders association said production in this area dropped to 25 million meters a day now from 40 million meters two years ago. It's hard to overstate how central cash is to Gujarat, and India in general. Most laborers, whether they operate looms, drive trucks, wash clothes or haul bricks, are paid in stacks of soft rupee notes, Mahatma Gandhi's face on each one. Even large real estate deals, say for a home that costs the equivalent of $500,000 or $600,000, will be done partly in blocks of rupees, to keep profits off the books. This was what motivated Mr. Modi, who has made fighting corruption a big plank in his platform. He said that by making people turn in old bank notes, he would capture billions of rupees of so-called black money. It has never been made clear how much black money he actually captured, and perhaps he thought he could get away with the enormous disruption because India's economy had been doing so well. It expanded at more than 8 percent annually between 2005 and 2009 and more than 7 percent between 2010 and 2014. But his timing seems to have been bad. Unlike many of the other big economies that turn on exports — such as China's, Japan's or Germany's — India is not nearly as industrialized. Mr. Modi has vowed to change this, launching a Make in India campaign to attract foreign investors. But analysts say that India's labor laws are still too restrictive, imposing all kinds of red tape on factories of more than 100 workers, which discourages businesses from thinking big. ""A manufacturing revolution is nowhere in sight,"" one commentator recently said. India's economy remains substantially influenced by domestic rural demand. And back-to-back droughts in 2014 and 2015 ruined millions of farmers, slowing down overall growth. Then in July 2017, before people had a chance to recover from the currency chaos — which had also hampered consumption, because many Indians simply didn't have any spare cash in their pockets — Mr. Modi moved ahead on another front: the new goods and services tax, or G.S.T. It was the most sweeping tax overhaul India had ever tried, and probably overdue. But many economists and business people questioned Mr. Modi's timing on this as well. Suddenly, with the economy softening, all but the smallest businesses had to file dozens of returns each year, online, paying taxes on everything from yarn to mixed nuts, often at confusing rates. Business owners like the Patels, who had run their factory off a calculator and a paper pad, said they had no idea how to file. ""You need a computer; you need to buy online time; you need to hire someone who knows how to do it,"" Manish Patel lamented. ""All this costs money."" Many small businesses began to suffer from something they did not understand. ""G.S.T., G.S.T., what is this G.S.T.?"" said Bharat Bhai Kavad, who works out of his house in Surat with his wife and daughter sewing lace on garments for a big textile company. ""I didn't know at first what this G.S.T. was, and now it's come from Delhi to Gujarat to Surat to my house."" Because the Kavad family's lace work is unregistered and informal — they get paid a few rupees for each lace they attach — they cannot produce the proper receipts bigger companies need to comply with new tax rules. The Kavads' earnings have been cut in half. This is one point that many people here make: The informal economy feeds the formal; the two are inextricably linked. ""The informal sector is a very important part of the economy, a bridge, a foundation of the economy,"" said Mr. Himanshu, the economics professor. ""And then you attack them?"" Politics are shaped by expectation, and many Indians said they expected more from Mr. Modi. About one million Indians enter the work force every month, and job creation is one of the country's most urgent political priorities. Mr. Modi has come nowhere near his promise of creating 10 million jobs a year. The unemployment rate was 5 percent, the worst in five years, in 2015-16. Some studies show that at best, a few hundred thousand jobs have been created each year under Mr. Modi in major industries such as textiles, transportation and information technology, though this excludes the informal sector, where millions of Indians traditionally work. India's economy still has a lot going for it: It is already huge, and still growing relatively fast. It has an educated work force; a young, working-age population; and a public that craves new technology. Facebook has 217 million monthly active users in India, second only to the United States. Economic growth is projected to be higher next year, and Mr. Modi's supporters say that as India's economy matures, some sort of slowdown was inevitable. And it is not as if his base has fragmented. For every Gujarati business owner who wants to send Mr. Modi an angry message, many others are still with him. This was the area where Mr. Modi built his commanding brand as the state's top politician for 13 years before becoming prime minister in 2014, and where he attracted heavy manufacturing and investment. But for many people here, politics and economics are not connected at the hip. Kailash Dhoot, a textile exporter, said that Mr. Modi's recent policies had wounded his business but that Mr. Modi's party was still his first choice. When asked why, Mr. Dhoot was quick, and curt, with an answer. ""Hindutva,"" he said. And he closed his mouth firmly, signaling the discussion was over. Hindutva is a philosophy adopted by Mr. Modi's party that emphasizes Hindu supremacy. Since Mr. Modi came to power, so-called cow vigilantes have brutalized or killed dozens of people, many Muslim, for slaughtering or trading cows, a venerated animal in the Hindu religion. The hate crimes seem to never end. Analysts fear that if the economy continues to come up short of expectations, Mr. Modi might turn more to what are termed ""communal issues,"" subjects that divide communities based on religion or caste. ""If economic maneuverability is limited,"" said Ashutosh Varshney, a political-science professor and India specialist at Brown University, ""then the communal card, the Hindu-Muslim card, is a massive political temptation."" ""That's what Mr. Modi did in Gujarat,'' Professor Varshney said. ""He twisted every available political possibility into a Hindu-Muslim question."" One example was Mr. Modi's accusations that opposition leaders were in cahoots with Pakistan, India's rival and a nation with a strong Islamic identity, after some opposition leaders met some Pakistani officials at a recent social event. Many people saw those claims as a low blow to stir up Gujarati Hindus, who make up the state's vast majority. ""It didn't used to be like this,"" said Hanif Belim, a taxi driver in Gujarat. But nowadays, he added, ""politicians divide the public and sit on the side and watch them fight."""

Read back issues of The #MeToo Moment here, sign up for the newsletter here, and tell us what you think at nytgender@nytimes.com. The first time I tried on a floor-length gown, I was 12 years old and on the cusp of ""becoming a woman"" — or, at least, parading as one for my bat mitzvah. The dress was an iridescent lavender, with rhinestone-encrusted straps and a tulle-stuffed princess skirt. I would wear it in a room packed with peers, family friends and relatives the following year, an experience so terrifying that a stress-induced flu would swiftly follow. But alone in the dressing room, I already felt seen. That some people wore outfits so spectacular on a regular basis — that they made themselves so visible — was unimaginable to me. I didn't know the half of it then. Those celebrities, whose beauty and elegance and occasional sartorial slip-ups I'd watched on E! for years, contained secrets their camera-ready appearances never let on. They were beholden to agreements unspoken and explicit, ones upon which their careers hinged and which are now, finally, coming to light. At The Times, where I work on the Styles desk, red carpet slide shows are a mainstay of awards season. We watch, pick our personal bests and worsts, and publish images that millions of people then judge for themselves. The photographs, at best, reflect a desire for shiny distractions. But there is a complicity to scrutinizing and ranking these women, too. Their dresses are not a reflection of their own style or their professional achievements. They speak to the larger economy of Hollywood, whose corruption becomes clearer with each turn of the news cycle. Moreover, our habitual participation in the red carpet industrial complex underscores the widely held perception that women's bodies are available for public consumption. So we're switching things up this year. We're sending a Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist, Damon Winter, to document the Golden Globes red carpet as a news event (you can see some of his coverage of Donald Trump here). We will have a slate of reporters watching and listening for smart, critical quotes from celebrities, not about what they're wearing, but about the future they envision for their industry — and the world. We've also published a series of curtain-raiser stories, which contain red carpet observations, as well as critiques and predictions, from journalists at The Times and The New York Times Magazine. Read on. What the Smiles Concealed Red carpet photos from awards shows past can now be seen as ""a metaphor for the difficulty of confronting or rejecting powerful men who harass or assault,"" writes Jodi Kantor, the investigative reporter who, with Megan Twohey, blew open the national dialogue on harassment in Hollywood. The Red Carpet Is Its Own Economy Our fashion critic Vanessa Friedman explores the relationship between fashion brands, celebrities and their handlers. (Hint: There's a lot of money involved.) The Empty Gesture of Red Carpet Protest Jenna Wortham, a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine, questions the value of wearing black as visual protest, especially at awards shows, where the participants have little to risk and publicity to gain. (""It feels completely privileged, and a little complicit, to still participate in the larger system that has condoned sexual violence in their industry,"" she writes. ""Besides, don't they already wear lots of black on the red carpet anyway?!"") Will Awards Season Ever Be the Same? Ms. Kantor wonders if the awards circuit can weather the post-Harvey Weinstein storm, or if it will fall with him. After #AskHerMore and #MeToo, Time's Up Cara Buckley, a Culture reporter and Carpetbagger columnist, explains how women are leading the charge against the industry's culture of abuse. The Outfit as Expression By choosing to wear black on Sunday, the women (and men!) of Hollywood are using fashion to its fullest potential: ""Clothes speak as loudly as many words, and they can be weaponized accordingly,"" writes Ms. Friedman, our critic.

It was a prank, but the message was clear: By entering California, they might as well have been entering foreign territory. And in many ways it feels like that these days, as the growing divide between California and the Trump administration erupted this past week over a dizzying range of flash points, from immigration to taxes to recreational marijuana use. What had been a rhetorical battle between a liberal state and a conservative administration is now a full-fledged fight. Just as Californians were enjoying their first days of legal pot smoking, the Trump administration moved to enforce federal laws against the drug. On the same day, the federal government said it would expand offshore oil drilling, which California's Senate leader called an assault on ""our pristine coastline."" When President Trump signed a law that would raise the tax bills of many Californians by restricting deductions, lawmakers in this state proposed a creative end-around — essentially making state taxes charitable contributions, and fully deductible. And California's refusal to help federal agents deport undocumented immigrants prompted one administration official to suggest that state politicians should be arrested. The clash between California and Mr. Trump and his supporters — between one America and another — began the morning after he won the presidency, when Kevin de León, the State Senate leader, and his counterpart in the Assembly, Anthony Rendon, said they ""woke up feeling like strangers in a foreign land."" Since then the fight has metastasized into what could be the greatest contest over values between a White House and a state since the 1950s and 1960s, when the federal government moved to end segregation and expand civil rights. Back then, of course, the ideologies and values at issue were reversed, as conservative Southerners, under the banner of states' rights, fought violently to uphold white supremacy. In these times it is liberal California making the case for states' rights, traditionally a Republican position. ""It seems like every day brings a new point of contention between two very different types of leadership,"" said Jim Newton, a lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles. And it does not end there: New laws that went into effect on Jan. 1 in California raised the minimum wage, allowed parents to withhold gender on birth certificates and strengthened what were already some of the toughest gun laws in the country by restricting ammunition sales and assault weapons, and barring school officials from carrying concealed weapons at work. Taken together, the measures are the surest signs yet of how California is setting itself apart from Washington — and many parts of America, too. Mr. de León, along with almost the entire leadership of California, has been a bulwark against the Trump administration. Mr. de León introduced the so-called sanctuary state legislation — the California Values Act — that restricts state authorities from cooperating with federal immigration agents, and places limits on agents entering schools, churches, hospitals or courthouses to detain undocumented immigrants. The law went into effect Jan. 1, provoking a prankster — presumably a Trump supporter — to put up those highway signs, and setting off a war of words between California and the administration. The state should ""hold on tight,"" said Thomas Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in an interview on Fox News last week. ""They are about to see a lot more special agents, a lot more deportation officers,"" he said. ""If the politicians in California don't want to protect their communities, then ICE will."" Mr. Homan went on to assail politicians who support the sanctuary policy, suggesting they should be arrested. Darrell Steinberg, the mayor of Sacramento, California's capital, reacted angrily on Wednesday, saying on Twitter that ""they certainly know where to find me."" Also this week, Mr. de León introduced legislation to limit the impact of the new tax bill on Californians by essentially allowing residents to pay their state taxes in the form of a charitable contribution, which could then be deducted when filing federal income tax. Mr. de León also said he was working with Eric H. Holder Jr., an attorney general under President Barack Obama, to push back against attempts to enforce federal marijuana law, which Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Thursday he would allow federal prosecutors to do. ""Whether Jeff Sessions likes cannabis is not the question,"" Mr. de León said. ""The people of California voted overwhelmingly to legalize marijuana for recreational use."" For his part, Mr. Trump is the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to not take a trip to California in his first calendar year in office, not even to visit his golf course in Rancho Palos Verdes, south of Los Angeles, or a mansion he owns in Beverly Hills, or to tour the vast damage left in the wake of a series of wildfires. By contrast, he has made multiple trips to other states hit by natural disasters, including Texas and Florida after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. In California, every state leader is a Democrat, including the governor and the leaders of the State Senate and Assembly. Of the state's 53 members in Congress, only 14 are Republicans, and analysts believe several of them are in jeopardy of losing their seats to Democrats in next year's midterm elections because of opposition in California to Mr. Trump. Still, not every Californian is lining up to join the opposition. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House majority leader, has stood firm with the president, was a strong supporter of the tax bill, and has said he believes there is still an opportunity for Democrats and the administration to come together, particularly on immigration. In an interview with Fox News on Friday, he said, ""I think there is a plan for securing the border, for dealing with chain migration."" He added, ""I think there is a common ground that both sides can get to."" But California's diversity — 40 percent Latino, and with an estimated 2.3 million undocumented workers, according to a Pew Research Center survey — is regarded by many people here as a powerful counternarrative to the Trump administration's anti-immigration policies and the ugly racial incidents and outbursts of white supremacy that have surfaced during his presidency in places like Charlottesville, Va. Beyond demographics and politics, charting its own course is part of the identity of California. ""We are the frontier,"" said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at the University of Southern California. ""Beyond us, there's nothing but ocean."" California is not the only liberal state standing up to the Trump administration. But as the most populous state, with close to 40 million people — if it were a country it would be the world's sixth largest economy, sandwiched between Britain and France — California has been energized in the age of Trump to take the lead in opposing what many here believe is a depressing reversal of American progress. ""California has distinguished itself from the federal government for a long time,"" said Elizabeth Ashford, a political consultant who has worked for Gov. Jerry Brown, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Senator Kamala Harris. ""Certainly Arnold spent a lot of time talking about California as almost a nation-state. And many Californians feel that way."" She continued, ""For Californians and California there's always this concept of a Golden State, a model of what a state can be and achieve."" These days, with the country roiled by a resurgence in white supremacy and nasty fights over immigration and diversity, essentially a battle over American identity, she said, ""there are sharp distinctions that many Californians are drawing between us and them."" Those distinctions may become sharper, as a generational shift in California Democratic politics, driven by leaders like Mr. de León, could tilt the state further to the left. Mr. de León, 51, is mounting a primary challenge to Senator Dianne Feinstein, 84, by positioning himself more to the left — and more stridently opposed to the president — than his rival. Ordinary Californians have found other ways to push back. One of them is Andrew Sturm, a graduate student in visual arts at the University of California, San Diego. Last year, Mr. Sturm was with a friend in Tijuana, Mexico, at a spot near the border where prototypes of Mr. Trump's planned wall had been positioned. ""We were thinking, man, these things look like drive-in movie screens,"" he said. ""We were thinking about how we could do something with them."" The result was a display of political art, in the form of light. One evening this fall at dusk, Mr. Sturm and other activists, working from the Mexican side of the border, erected theater lights and used stencils to project images onto the prototypes — of a ladder, of the Statue of Liberty. ""I felt kind of sick as a U.S. citizen,"" he said, referring to Mr. Trump's immigration policies. ""I didn't want folks in Mexico to think this is how we all feel."""
briefing,2018-01-07,Good morning. ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/briefing/north-korea-jerusalem-golden-globes.html,1226," Good morning.  Here's what you need to know: • President Trump started 2018 with such a furious wave of Twitter posts — threatening North Korea and urging protesters to overthrow the Iranian government, to name just a few — that some worry that America's credibility is at risk. Two things stand out, our chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe writes: How far the tweets deviate from the way past presidents expressed themselves. And how rarely Mr. Trump has followed through on his words. Mr. Trump over the weekend dismissed questions about his mental fitness that were raised in a new book,  calling himself a ""very stable genius."" _____ • North and South Korea start high-level talks on Tuesday aimed at easing tensions and allowing North Korean athletes to participate in the Winter Olympics next month. The talks could lead to a thaw in the tensions over the North's nuclear program, but President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has vowed to take a tough line in negotiations. And for decades, U.S. intelligence officials warned that the North was making progress on a missile that could reach the United States. But the last breakthroughs happened much faster than they had expected. _____ • In India,  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity is eroding as the once-roaring economy cools down. Economists agree that two of Mr. Modi's biggest policy gambles — abruptly voiding most of the nation's currency and imposing a sweeping new sales tax — have slowed India's meteoric growth. Now that his economic strategy is losing its sheen, Mr. Modi may lean even more heavily on Hindu nationalism, a risky gambit as social tensions simmer, especially between Hindus and Muslims and among castes. _____ • President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital is seen by many as the death knell for a  two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And even the Palestine Liberation Organization is asking if that might not be such a bad idea. But Israeli and Palestinian visions of what that single state would look like are mutually exclusive. Separately, the financial ties between Israel and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, continue to deepen, even with Mr. Kushner's diplomatic role in the Middle East. _____ • At almost twice the length of the U.S.-Mexico border, Australia's dingo fence is the longest in the world. The idea is simple: to keep feral dogs and dingoes from getting to sheep farms on the other side of the wire. But new research has raised questions about the fence's environmental impact, and new technology threatens to upend its traditional means of maintenance. Meanwhile, Sydney recorded its highest temperatures since 1939, with western areas hitting 117 degrees Fahrenheit, or 47 Celsius. _____ • The Golden Globes are Sunday night, the first major Hollywood gathering since the explosive revelations last year of sexual assault and harassment. Women attending have been asked to wear black on the red carpet, in solidarity with the #MeToo movement. Above, the actress Andrea Riseborough. In a series of essays, our reporters discuss whether the red carpet will ever be the same after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. The show starts at 8 p.m. Eastern, with Seth Meyers hosting. We'll have live coverage. _____ • Ripple is now the second-largest virtual currency behind Bitcoin. One of its founders even briefly overtook Mark Zuckerberg on the world's richest list with a worth of more than $59 billion. • ""So we're kicking off 2018 with a nightmare."" That was our tech reporter on the emergence of Meltdown and Spectre, two of the worst computer security flaws yet. • Several of Uber's early shareholders, including Travis Kalanick, its former chief executive, were said to be selling large chunks of stock to a consortium led by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate. • Here's a snapshot of global markets. • China and South Korea were searching for 32 sailors, including 30 Iranians, after their oil tanker collided with a freighter off China's east coast late Saturday.

The culprit, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has an extrudable stomach that wraps around the coral to ingest it. When unrest erupted in Iran this month, President Trump used Twitter to directly reach out to anti-government protesters in dozens of towns. Such public outreach is a lot easier than it used to be. A hundred years ago today, President Woodrow Wilson, above, outlined his terms for an end to World War I in a speech meant to appeal to the war-weary people of America's European foes. American newspapers like The New York Times printed the 14-point speech in full, but that did not mean the average German would get the message. A few days later, a report in The Times documented efforts to spread the speech behind enemy lines, after Berlin threatened to execute pilots of planes distributing copies. ""What is now wanted is some kind of flying craft which will travel fifty to a hundred miles or more, dropping propaganda on the way,"" The Daily Chronicle, a British paper, reported. ""Here is a chance for ingenious inventors to improve on the existing facilities for invading the enemy countries with moral munitions and scattering broadcast pamphlets, tracts and pictures.""

Letter,2018-01-07,To the Editor:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/letters/maine-shrimp.html,159," To the Editor: Re ""The End of Maine Shrimp?"" (Food, Dec. 27), about the species' disappearance from the state's warming waters: Some of my fondest childhood memories are of sitting on seaside rocks, eating fried Maine shrimp dipped in tartar sauce or slathered with ketchup. My father, a native-born Mainer, knew how to avoid the tourist lines and the high prices that came along with them. But those traditions I came to know and love are threatened by climate change. In a state where our environment and economy are bound together, it's not just our favored traditions that are threatened, but our very way of life.

News,2018-01-07,"ALIGARH, India — Signs and banners for Paytm, India’s biggest digital payments service, festoon Pooran Singh’s cellphone shop, where people drop in all day to add data or talk time to their prepaid phones.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/technology/india-digital-money.html,1210," ALIGARH, India — Signs and banners for Paytm, India's biggest digital payments service, festoon Pooran Singh's cellphone shop, where people drop in all day to add data or talk time to their prepaid phones. Yet few of these people actually use Paytm at the store, which straddles two dusty streets in this sleepy north Indian city in which tractors jostle with cows for space on the narrow roads. ""People recharge in cash,"" Mr. Singh said, after a young man handed him 20 rupees, about 32 cents, to top up his mother's phone. The scene in Mr. Singh's shop underscores a persistent reality of India's economy: People prefer cash for most routine transactions, despite intensive efforts by the government and global technology companies to lure them onto digital platforms. India's reluctance to give up paper money poses challenges for the firms that are vying to offer electronic payments, including local players like Paytm, which has received financing from the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and American tech companies, like Facebook, Google and PayPal. ""Cash is convenient,"" said Caesar Sengupta, who oversees Google's products for emerging markets. ""It's anonymous. You can use it everywhere."" Even so, tech companies see India's low rate of digital payments as an opportunity. They all cite China, where in just a few years, mobile payments became so popular that it is now difficult to get through the day with cash alone. ""In India, we're going to see a similar rise,"" Mr. Sengupta said in November, shortly after Google introduced Tez, a payments app for India. One reason for tech companies' optimism is that digital payments in India have increased over the past year. The value of transactions using digital wallets, the business on which Paytm was built, rose 64 percent from December 2016 to December 2017. Transactions made with the Unified Payments Interface, a government-backed technology used by Tez and many other mobile apps, went from virtually nothing a year ago to $2.1 billion last month. Leading India's budding payments shift are Paytm and its chief executive, Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Mr. Sharma founded the company seven years ago as a way for cellphone users to pay their bills online. It is now India's largest consumer-payments app, with 302 million account holders and 90 million active users. Customers can use it to buy goods at physical stores, book movie or airline tickets, send money to each other or order items from Paytm's online mall. A transaction requires a quick scan of a merchant's bar code or a few taps on a smartphone, rivaling Apple Pay or Venmo in simplicity. Mr. Sharma aspires to put his company at the center of Indians' financial lives, and he has pledged to spend $1.9 billion over the next two years toward that goal. ""Our truest ambition is for Paytm to be known as the bank for this new-age, digital, mobile world,"" he said in an interview at the company's headquarters in Noida, just outside Delhi. Merchants like Mr. Singh are crucial to Paytm's plans. The company pays Mr. Singh a bounty of 20 rupees for each of the eight or so customers he signs up each month, with additional payments if a newcomer continues to use the service. He earns an additional 18 rupees each time he verifies the identity of an existing Paytm user with his fingerprint scanner, a new requirement imposed by the government on all digital wallet companies. Mr. Singh's phone shop has also become a virtual A.T.M. for Paytm's nascent banking division, which plans to turn 100,000 shops across India into mini-branches where customers can deposit and withdraw cash, get a loan and buy insurance policies. ""We really want to reach the underserved, underbanked customer,"" said Renu Satti, who leads the Paytm bank. Paytm's strategy dovetails with the goals of India's central government. Narendra Modi, who became prime minister in 2014, has sought to recast his country as ""digital India,"" and his government has heavily promoted cashless transactions. In November 2016, Mr. Modi suddenly banned most of India's currency. The edict forced people to exchange their rupees for new notes at banks, setting off a short-term cash crunch and prompting many Indians to consider digital options. Still, the country's cash economy has endured. Only one-third of India's 1.3 billion residents have access to the internet. Of those who are able to go online, just 14 percent make mobile payments at least once a week, according to Kantar TNS, a research firm based in London. Consumer trust is a big issue. Ghani Khan, who was finishing a snack with his wife at Aligarh's lone McDonald's, said that someone had once stolen 3,300 rupees, what would be about $52 now, from his Paytm account. ""People feel scared to use these apps,"" Mr. Khan said. Although he got his money back, he now avoids payment apps, preferring to use cash or his debit card. (Paytm says that most such problems are related to thieves who call users and persuade them to turn over sensitive account data.) Merchants also worry that officials are promoting digital transactions as a way to better track commerce — and collect more taxes. Anusheel Shrivastava, a top Kantar executive in India, said his firm found that 6 percent of mobile phone users made at least one digital transaction a day in 2017, up from 2 percent in 2016. That number is likely to increase further when WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, adds payments to its service in the next few months. Paytm stands out in part because of the 10,000 employees that it has in the field to help new businesses use the service, educate existing ones about new features and troubleshoot problems. There are about six million merchants in its network, from giant multinationals like Uber to tiny neighborhood sweet shops. ""We have to train them, we have to retrain them, we have to visit them,"" said Yashwin Gupta, who oversees a team of 65 Paytm representatives in the region that includes Aligarh. ""That's our daily job."" The job is getting easier now that Paytm is better known. Last month, Mukesh Gupta sought Paytm's help in setting up the service for his toy shop here after 10 to 20 percent of his customers asked to pay with Paytm. ""People like to spend money on more than just needs,"" he said. Aligarh, with 1.2 million residents, is a barometer for Paytm's progress because it's a midsize city, and because Mr. Sharma, the company's chief executive, grew up nearby. On one visit home, he said, he met a Hindi-speaking merchant who did not know how to get money out of Paytm and into his bank. The problem? Paytm's app for merchants was in English, and the icons were not clear enough for those who did not speak the language. Paytm soon developed a Hindi version. In recent months, skeptics have questioned whether Paytm can maintain its growth. The new regulations requiring customer verification could turn off some customers. The company is also spending heavily on incentives, such as giving cash back on certain purchases and free credit-card processing for merchants. Mr. Sharma said such expenses were necessary investments. ""The only way to grow digital transactions is to make them free,"" he said. ""This is a culturally different country being built."""
News,2018-01-08,"CAIRO — The strongest challenger to Egypt’s military-backed leader withdrew from the country’s presidential race on Sunday, with his lawyer saying the government had forced him to drop out.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/world/middleeast/egypt-ahmed-shafik.html,660," CAIRO — The strongest challenger to Egypt's military-backed leader withdrew from the country's presidential race on Sunday, with his lawyer saying the government had forced him to drop out. The candidate, Ahmed Shafik, a former Air Force general who narrowly lost the country's only free presidential election in 2012, was deported back to Egypt from the United Arab Emirates in December, just days after announcing his intention to run in the 2018 election. Shortly after his arrival, Mr. Shafik called a popular television show, on which he denied news reports about his deportation and said that he was reconsidering his bid for president. On Sunday, Mr. Shafik put an end to the guesswork over his candidacy with a terse statement on Twitter, saying, ""After reviewing the situation, I realized I am not the best person to manage state affairs in the coming period."" His exit from the race reinforced popular concerns over the integrity of the presidential election, which is set to take place this spring. Mr. Shafik, 76, could not be immediately reached for comment on Sunday, but one of the lawyers representing him said that the Egyptian government had coerced him into withdrawing by threatening to investigate old corruption charges against him. They lawyer spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the subject's sensitivity. The lawyer's account was broadly confirmed by audio recordings of telephone calls by an Egyptian intelligence officer, which were obtained by The New York Times. During one of those calls, the officer, Capt. Ashraf al-Kholi, cautioned a television presenter against attacking Mr. Shafik on his show because the government was ""still in talks"" with him. ""If he decides to be with us, then he is one of the former leaders of the armed forces, you got it?"" Mr. Kholi said; but if he doesn't, ""we will curse his father's forebears."" President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who rose to power after overthrowing Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist president, in 2013, has yet to announce his candidacy, but he is expected to run, and critics worry that he will try to exclude any real competitors. Two other candidates who have entered the race are currently facing charges that many believe are politically motivated. If they are convicted, they will be ineligible to run. Since returning to Cairo from the United Arab Emirates a few weeks ago, Mr. Shafik has spent most of his time in a suite at a luxury hotel in Cairo, declining to give interviews while Egyptian politicians and ordinary people wondered whether he was under arrest. His relatives and aides said that he was not allowed to speak to anyone nor go anywhere without the permission of Egypt's security agencies. Even though he prospered in the era of Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted from power in 2011 by a popular uprising, Mr. Shafik has a large base of supporters in Egypt. His military record, and name recognition, may have made him a strong candidate. He fought in Egypt's two wars with Israel, in 1967 and 1973, and rose to command the Air Force. As minister of civil aviation, a post he held for a decade beginning in 2001, he oversaw the modernization and development of the national airline and the Cairo airport. In a bid to bolster his support during his last days in power in 2011, Mr. Mubarak promoted Mr. Shafik to prime minister in the hope that he could resolve the crisis brought about by a popular uprising. Mr. Shafik lost the presidential election to Mr. Morsi the next year by only about 2 percent of the vote. To some of his supporters, Mr. Shafik was seen as a candidate who could have helped restore the stability they enjoyed before the Arab Spring erupted. The Egyptian government has been overseeing a harsh crackdown on opponents since 2013. Hundreds have been killed in street protests and thousands jailed. Militant attacks, many by the Islamic State, have multiplied since, dealing multiple blows to the country's economy."
News,2018-01-08,Here’s what to expect in the week ahead:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/business/inflation-consumer-tech-earnings.html,583," Here's what to expect in the week ahead: ECONOMY The Federal Reserve aims to keep inflation rising at an annual rate of 2 percent. That has been the lodestar of monetary policy in the United States for the past 40 years. But a growing chorus of voices inside and outside the Fed think it's time for a change. Interest rates are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future, and the combination of low rates and low inflation leaves little room for the Fed to respond to future economic downturns. Experts have advanced a variety of alternatives, which can be sorted into two broad categories: Replace the 2 percent target permanently, or agree to replace it temporarily when the economy next needs the Fed's help. On Monday, the Brookings Institution will hold a discussion on the alternatives that will include the former chairman of the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke, and the presidents of the Boston Fed and the San Francisco Fed, among other experts. Binyamin Appelbaum TECHNOLOGY At the International CES trade show this week in Las Vegas, thousands of tech and car companies will showcase some of their hottest new innovations: artificial intelligence, self-driving car systems, smart refrigerators, voice-controlled accessories, fifth-generation cellular connectivity and more. Brian X. Chen ECONOMY The European Central Bank on Thursday will publish an account of its monetary policy meeting that was held in December. Analysts will read the minutes even more closely than usual to see if they confirm speculation that an increasingly strong faction on the central bank's Governing Council is in favor of making the current round of monetary stimulus the last. The central bank said last fall that it would cut its purchases of government and corporate bonds in half in January, but promised to keep buying debt at least through September. With the eurozone economy exceeding expectations, many economists think there will be no reason to continue the purchases after that. Jack Ewing BANKING For big American banks, the pleasure of a lower corporate tax rate won't come until after a brief jab of pain: Banks have been warning their investors about a rough fourth quarter as they adjust accounting procedures in response to the new Republican tax plan, which President Trump signed into law late last month. The first quarterly earnings reports are due this week, with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo leading the pack. Wells Fargo has not said how the tax bill will affect its earnings. JPMorgan said last month that it could take a $2 billion hit. Emily Flitter RETAIL The Commerce Department is scheduled to release data on holiday sales on Friday. Many early indications suggest it could have been a strong holiday shopping season, which might bring much-needed relief for retailers struggling to transform their e-commerce businesses. Michael Corkery ECONOMY The American economy is the strongest it has been in a decade, but inflation remains in check. That's good for consumers, but it's something of a mystery for Federal Reserve policymakers. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release data on consumer prices in December. Economists expect it to show that inflation remained low, but will be watching closely for any sign of a pickup, which could prompt the Fed to raise rates more quickly. Ben Casselman"
News,2018-01-08,"WASHINGTON — President Trump will head to Tennessee on Monday to appeal to farmers, a key demographic that helped elect him, as he promotes his tax law and previews a new White House strategy to help rural America.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/us/politics/trump-farmers-agriculture-trade-taxes.html,1500," WASHINGTON — President Trump will head to Tennessee on Monday to appeal to farmers, a key demographic that helped elect him, as he promotes his tax law and previews a new White House strategy to help rural America. But back in Washington, some of the economic policies his administration is pursuing are at odds with what many in the farm industry say is needed, from a potentially drastic shift in trade policies that have long supported agriculture to some little-noticed tax increases in the $1.5 trillion tax law. American farmers are facing some of the most challenging times in a generation. Global prices for their products — including corn, wheat and other commodities — are mired in a multiyear slump, and the rural economy has remained sluggish since the recession. Net farm income has been roughly halved in the last four years, the largest four-year decrease since the Great Depression, the American Farm Bureau Federation says. Many farmers and farm states supported the president, whose campaign made overtures to parts of America that had been left behind economically and felt overlooked in Washington. The farm community has cheered the president's deregulatory agenda, especially a move to rescind tighter regulations on water pollution. Mr. Trump's appearance at the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention in Nashville on Monday will mark the first time in 25 years a president has attended. In his speech to the group, the president is likely to touch on the successful passage of the tax bill and his administration's initiatives to combat opioid addiction, White House officials said in a briefing on Friday. The White House is also expected to release a report Monday on reviving rural prosperity, which will outline goals for helping rural areas, including expanding high-speed internet, health services, work-force training and the use of biotechnology. The report stems from an executive order Mr. Trump signed in April. ""What we often see communicated about rural America is that there are these isolated pockets of despair that are beyond hope or recovery,"" Ray Starling, the special assistant to the president for agriculture, agricultural trade and food assistance on the National Economic Council, said in a briefing Friday. The report makes clear that ""that's not what we believe."" Yet some of the president's economic policies could actually harm the farm industry. New analyses of the tax law by economists at the Department of Agriculture suggest it could actually lower farm output in the years to come and effectively raise taxes on the lowest-earning farm households, while delivering large gains for the richest farmers. And the administration's trade policies continue to be a concern for farmers, who benefit from access to other markets, including by exporting their products. Mr. Trump continues to threaten to withdraw from trade pacts if other countries do not grant the United States a better deal, a position that has put him at odds with much of the farm industry. ""Trade has become an increasingly important and substantial part of the ag economy. So anything that causes a ripple in that can have not just little effects but significant effects,"" said Dale Moore, the executive director for public policy at the Farm Bureau. Indeed, part of the White House report Monday is expected to discuss global markets' importance to rural America. Agriculture has been the biggest beneficiary of pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which have allowed the United States to export grains and meat. In April, when the president came to the brink of withdrawing the United States from the pact, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue helped to dissuade him by showing him a map of the part of the country that would be hardest hit — farming states that also helped to elect Mr. Trump. ""It creates a lot of anxiety across all of agriculture, particularly the U.S. pulling out of Nafta,"" said Kevin Kester, a rancher in California and the president-elect of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Farmers and ranchers like Mr. Kester worry that they are losing ground to foreign competitors, as major markets like Japan, Europe and Mexico push ahead with their own trade pacts. Although Mr. Trump has talked about forging new bilateral deals, the United States does not appear to be close to forming any. American beef exporters are now at a big disadvantage in Japan, Mr. Kester said, after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal that would have included Japan, and Japan signed a free-trade agreement that cut tariffs for Australian beef. ""We're continuing to talk to the Trump administration and urge them to get on the horse and get going with talks with Japan in particular,"" Mr. Kester said. Nations like Canada are also beginning to export goods that have long been a staple of United States exports, such as lobster. Farmers have lobbied the president in recent months to preserve free trade agreements with Canada, Mexico and South Korea. On Thursday, a group of six Republican senators visited the White House to lobby the president on trade. Pat Roberts, the senator from Kansas who led the delegation, said the president had ""really listened to our concerns"" and ""understands the difficulty farm country is going through."" ""I delivered the message that farmers and ranchers need to grow export markets and maintain our status as a reliable supplier, more especially with Canada and Mexico in Nafta renegotiations,"" Mr. Roberts said. Trade analysts said these visits from farm state representatives and the president's trip to the Farm Bureau meeting were most likely the product of Nafta supporters inside the White House, who are trying to influence the president's views on trade. Yet there is no sign yet that these meetings have altered the president's long-held skepticism of Nafta. ""The reports we're hearing is the message is being delivered,"" said Michael Dykes, the president of the International Dairy Foods Association, an industry lobbying group. However, he said, ""we haven't seen anything visible to see that they're taking it on and changing course."" Without existing free trade agreements, many agricultural products would face prohibitively high tariffs as they cross borders. Food is still one of the most protected products under global rules. Without free trade agreements, Mexico could raise its tariffs to up to 75 percent on American chicken and Idaho potatoes. South Korea could raise its tariffs to 40 percent on beef and 36 percent on cheese. ""I believe the president is genuine when he says he wants to take care of the folks in rural America. I think he's also hearing from rural America that, hey, Nafta is critical to agriculture,"" Mr. Dykes said. ""Nafta is woven into the fabric of our business."" Mr. Trump has positioned his tax overhaul, which lowers individual and corporate rates, as an economic salve for rural America, including farmers. The new law won support from farmers, but many warn that its benefits could be blunted by a protectionist approach to trade. Stanley H. Ryan, the chief executive of Darigold, said the tax bill was ""helpful and supportive"" for businesses like his, a century-old dairy producer in Washington State. However, ""to get the full benefits of it, you've got to have market access,"" he said. The Farm Bureau endorsed both the House and Senate versions of the bill, and Mr. Trump signed a compromise measure into law in December. The final version included several provisions the bureau had championed, such as the ability for businesses to immediately deduct the cost of new investments. It also narrowed the number of households affected by the estate tax, a move the bureau praised even though it had pushed to eliminate the tax entirely. But research presented on Friday in Philadelphia, at America's annual mega-gathering of economists, suggests the bill contains downsides for the industry in general and particularly for lower-income farmers. A model of the law's effects on farm households by Siraj G. Bawa and James M. Williamson, of the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service, projects that 70 to 80 percent of the law's benefits will flow to the top 1 percent of farm households by income. The law actually shrinks tax refunds for the lowest-earning 20 percent of farm households, Mr. Bawa said in a session hosted by the Agriculture and Applied Economics Association. The reason stems from a combination of changes in the bill, including its elimination of a tax break for domestic production. ""The lowest quintile is actually getting a tax raise under this,"" Mr. Bawa said. A second paper, from Jayson Beckman and Munisamy Gopinath of the Agriculture Department and Marinos Tsigas of the United States International Trade Commission, projects that the law will reduce American farm production nearly 1 percent for primary agriculture, even though it reduces tax rates on farmers. The reason, in part, is that the tax bill's favorable treatment of other sectors, such as construction and factories, could draw investment away from agriculture. The authors suggest those reductions could be offset — if America could secure better access to foreign consumers through trade negotiations."

""One cannot force one's lifestyle on the future generations,"" Mr. Rouhani said, in remarks reported by the ISNA news agency. ""The problem is that we want two generations after us to live the way we like them to."" In his most extensive comments yet on the protests, Mr. Rouhani said that those people who took to the streets across the country did so because they were seeking a better life. ""Some imagine that the people only want money and a good economy, but will someone accept a considerable amount of money per month when for instance the cyber network would be completely blocked?"" he asked. ""Is freedom and the life of the people purchasable with money? Why do some give the wrong reasons? This is an insult to the people."" Mr. Rouhani, a moderate, has been seeking a relaxation in social controls, but he faces resistance from hard-liners in unelected power centers like the judiciary, vetting councils and the state news media. They want to keep in place the framework of Islamic laws that effectively dictate how people should live, despite enormous changes in Iranian society in the past decade alone. Iran's judiciary and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blame the country's ""enemies"" for the protests in over 80 cities, which started on Dec. 28. They said the actions were organized by the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia with the aim of bringing down the Islamic government. They call the hundreds of protesters who have been arrested ""rioters"" and want all social media to be banned. In a move seemingly unrelated to the protests, but one that gives insight into hard-liners' attitudes, all English classes in elementary schools were banned on Sunday to combat the spread of Western influence. Several political supporters of Mr. Rouhani say that the first protest in the city of Mashhad was actually masterminded by the hard-liners, in an attempt to discredit the government. The Iranian president has twice run for office promising to reinvigorate the economy, but has little to show for it. To make matters worse, his recent budget enraged many by calling for cuts in fuel subsidies and cash payments to the poor, alongside sharp rises in spending for many clerical institutions. But the protesters have also spoken of a host of other problems, including endemic corruption and the government's expensive support for the Syrian government and Shiite groups throughout the Middle East, particularly Hezbollah, the Shiite movement in Lebanon. Seeking to blunt criticism over the economy, Mr. Rouhani stressed the breadth of the protesters' demands as well as their validity. ""The people have demands, some of which are economic, social and security-related, and all these demands should be heeded,"" he said on Monday. He did not directly refer to slogans calling for Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, to step down, but he said that no one was exempt from criticism. ""We have no infallible officials and any authority can be criticized,"" he said. Mr. Rouhani said that the social media platform Telegram, used by over 40 million Iranians but blocked during the protests, would be reopened. The photo-sharing app Instagram, which was also closed, has been partially reopened but is still not usable on mobile devices. ""Everything good has its disadvantages,"" Mr. Rouhani said of social media, ""but one cannot say that, for instance, automobile and motorcycle factories should be completely closed due to the dangers that these have."""
News,2018-01-08,The stock market has surged. Unemployment is at 4.1 percent. ISIS has largely been vanquished from Iraq and Syria. ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/upshot/strong-economies-lift-presidents-trump-seems-an-exception.html,1018," The stock market has surged. Unemployment is at 4.1 percent. ISIS has largely been vanquished from Iraq and Syria.  But despite it all, Donald J. Trump's approval ratings are mired in the upper 30s. No president has had worse ratings at this stage of his term since modern polling began more than three-quarters of a century ago. With President Trump starting the new year with a blizzard of tweets and fresh controversy seemingly every day, there are still debates about whether he is as weak as he looks. After all, he managed to win the presidency with terrible favorability ratings a little over a year ago. Analysts have understandably been cautious about assuming that his weak ratings will doom him or his party again. But it seems clear that Mr. Trump's approval ratings betray significant political weakness. Setting aside the question of how much credit first-year presidents deserve for a strong economy — they have less influence than you might think — President Trump's ratings should be much better. A 4.1 percent unemployment rate, the lowest in 17 years, is more typically associated with a 60-plus-percent approval rating for a first-term president.  Lyndon Johnson is the only other first-term president in the era of modern polling with an approval rating under 50 percent while the jobless rate was below 5 percent. But this came after he'd already been president about four years (having first finished out John F. Kennedy's term) and as the Vietnam War began to drag down his presidency. Mr. Trump started in a far worse position than other incoming presidents. His initial approval rating was in the low-to-mid 40s, while most presidents enter with an approval rating over 60 percent. It was fair to speculate that his approval ratings would gradually rise with the benefit of a strong economy. Perhaps he would even benefit from low expectations, as many suspected he did during the presidential campaign.  But by now the economy would have been expected to lift his approval rating into the 50s, based on an analysis of presidential approval and economic data going back to 1950. This is despite the tendency for presidents' approval ratings to decline during their time in office. If the economy were to overcome Mr. Trump's unpopularity and send his approval ratings up, you would think we would have started to see signs of it. It is certainly possible that the economy — or other good news — will still lift his ratings. But it seems just as likely that Mr. Trump will continue to feel the burden of his time in office. On average, a first-term president's approval rating drops by about a point per quarter after controlling for inflation and unemployment (and controlling for the large bump George W. Bush received after the Sept. 11 attacks). Mr. Trump still has some of the advantages that helped him win despite low favorability ratings in 2016. He appears to maintain the support of his base and fairly high levels of Republican unity. Indeed, his favorability ratings are still higher than they were in the weeks heading into the 2016 election, when they were in the mid 30s. Many pollsters aren't asking the favorability question anymore, but those that do find it roughly equal to his approval ratings (high 30s).  Moreover, his approval ratings among voters might be higher than among all adults; noncitizens may take a survey but are ineligible to vote, and nonwhite and young voters tend to disapprove of the president but have low turnout rates. National data might not be entirely representative of relatively white battleground states and districts, either.  All of this helps explain why many analysts have been cautious about assessing Mr. Trump's low approval ratings. If his ratings are as good or better today than they were when he won and when Republicans kept control of the Senate and the House, the argument goes, why shouldn't they win again? These points are worth keeping in mind, especially if Mr. Trump's ratings were to tick back up into the 40s. But the big difference between today and 2016 is simple: Mr. Trump is now the president, and elections tend to be referendums on the party in power. A president's approval rating is typically a very strong predictor of the results of presidential elections and even a helpful one in congressional elections.  Since 1950, no party has held the House through a midterm election when the president's approval rating is less than 40 percent. The Republican Party's considerable structural advantages in the House would at least give them a shot to survive this time, but the growing Democratic advantage on the generic congressional ballot and the G.O.P.'s weak showings in this year's special congressional elections suggest that the president's approval rating is weighing on the party in exactly the way one would expect. And while Mr. Trump's upset victory in 2016 — defying the pre-election polls that showed Hillary Clinton leading in key battleground states — has given him the sheen of invincibility, his victory was not impressive by most standards.  Fundamental-based models — without taking candidates into account — tended to show that the party out of power was a clear if narrow favorite to win in 2016: The pace of economic growth and President Obama's approval rating were positives for the Democrats, but that wasn't enough for the party to be favored because of the burden of seeking the presidency for a third consecutive term. Mr. Trump had the added advantage of facing Mrs. Clinton, who was under F.B.I. investigation for most of the campaign and ended with the worst unfavorability ratings of any candidate who won a major party nomination other than Mr. Trump, according to Gallup.  Yet in the end, Mr. Trump lost the popular vote by two percentage points, with 46 percent of the vote. It was the second-worst showing since 1948 for the candidate of the party out of power against a party seeking at least a third straight presidential term (after Michael Dukakis in 1988). It was not necessarily a show of strength.  None of this is to say that Mr. Trump's approval ratings can't or won't rise. But at some point, he'll probably need them to."
News,2018-01-08,"HORGOS, China — Except for men with long beards and women wearing veils or jewelry with a crescent moon motif, just about anyone can enter Chinese territory — at least a few miles of it — across a frontier marked only by two thin stripes of paint daubed across the road.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/world/asia/kazakhstan-china-border.html,1352," HORGOS, China — Except for men with long beards and women wearing veils or jewelry with a crescent moon motif, just about anyone can enter Chinese territory — at least a few miles of it — across a frontier marked only by two thin stripes of paint daubed across the road. The stripes — one red, one light blue — demarcate the border between China's restive region of Xinjiang in the far west of the country and Kazakhstan, a Central Asian neighbor. There are no Chinese visa checks, no officious border guards or customs officials, only a detachment of the People's Armed Police, a paramilitary force entrusted with watching out for Islamic-looking dress near the stripes on the road. The visa-free border area is the result of an agreement between China and Kazakhstan that in 2012 established a special economic development zone covering three square miles and comprising territory from both countries. China has set up many special zones over the years, but they are all firmly within its borders and open only to Chinese and foreigners with Chinese visas. ""This is one of a kind,"" said Alexey A. Ivanov, the vice president of the Kazakh side of the zone, which is fenced off from the rest of Kazakhstan and effectively operates as a separate ministate, governed by managers appointed by Kazakhstan's state railway corporation. The unusually relaxed border at what the Chinese call Horgos and the Kazakhs Khorgos is all the more remarkable because it marks the entrance to a tense Chinese region that has been struggling for decades to contain a low-grade but persistent insurgency by militants from a minority Chinese Muslim ethnic group, the Uighurs. Posters written in Russian, a language most Kazakhs can understand, make clear that the area is not entirely at peace. They offer a ""friendly"" warning that bushy beards and Islamic clothing are not welcome in China and include photos of prohibited dress and jewelry. An American diplomat with a hipster-style beard who tried to visit recently got stopped by the People's Armed Police and was let in only after Mr. Ivanov convinced the Chinese that he was not a potential terrorist. A New York Times correspondent with a short beard had no trouble walking across the stripes in the road into China, despite a long history of difficulty obtaining a Chinese visa. The atmosphere is more bizarre than menacing, and none of the people questioned on either side of the border expressed any worries about safety. Shao Yuqun, a Chinese construction worker laboring in the snow, said he was far more anxious about frostbite than Islamist terrorism. Like many Han Chinese living in Xinjiang but originally from the other side of the country, he said he had migrated west because he could earn more than at home. The border-straddling zone, known as the International Center for Boundary Cooperation and located just a few miles from a new Kazakh railway hub for freight trains from China, was meant to become an island of trade-driven prosperity that would showcase Kazakh-Chinese cooperation and help enrich both countries' impoverished border areas. Instead, it has become a study in the wide economic gulf that has opened up between a booming China, which used to look up to the Soviet Union as its ""big brother,"" and struggling former Soviet lands. Compared with most other former Soviet republics, Kazakhstan is faring reasonably well, its economy driven by a highly educated population and large reserves of oil and other natural resources. Ruled by Nursultan A. Nazarbayev for its 26 years of independence, the country has avoided the violent strife that has cursed other former Soviet lands in Central Asia. It is deeply corrupt and hardly a thriving democracy, but it is far less intrusively authoritarian than China. Kazakhstan, which takes pride in its ability, unlike Russia, to deliver results, has big plans for its side of the economic development zone with China, including a racetrack, a local version of Disneyland to be called Happyland, luxury hotels and dozens of entertainment, shopping and conference centers. It also has plans for an airport. So far, however, these exist only in miniature form on a big tabletop model that Mr. Ivanov shows off to visitors. ""Everything is ready to go,"" he said in an interview, noting that Kazakhstan's futuristic new capital city, Astana, had its beginnings just over two decades ago as no more than an architect's model. The Chinese side, meanwhile, is already studded with real buildings, including four big shopping malls flashing neon signs and full of stalls papered with pleas for business in mangled Russian. It had a head start, in that the Chinese portion of the joint zone is connected to an existing city and thus did not need much extra work to get electricity, water and other basic services. The Kazakh side, in contrast, had to be built from scratch, and it shows: The place is a barren, snow-covered wasteland with only a single duty-free shop and a few barely started building sites. Its main attraction for Chinese visitors is a stretch Cadillac limousine offering tours of the desolate landscape. Around two million Chinese enter the zone each year, far more than the number of Kazakhs, but they mostly stay on the Chinese side. Traffic across the barely marked border, at least in winter, flows almost entirely one way. Only a trickle of Chinese pass into Kazakhstan as throngs of Kazakhs pour in the other direction to shop for clothing, toys and electronic goods, many of them counterfeit, in Chinese shops. ""It is not Hong Kong or Shanghai, but it is a great chance for us to see what China is like,"" said Aidos Sarym, a Kazakh political analyst who has visited. The experience, he added, will help calm a widespread fear felt by many Kazakhs of China and its people. While there is not much to see yet on the Kazakh side other than snow, Mr. Ivanov, the deputy director, thinks his desolate domain can still attract waves of Chinese tourists in the future. ""Eighty percent of Chinese don't have passports, and this is the only chance they have to visit a foreign country,"" he said. Kazakhs who cross the border into Horgos are greeted by a giant screen displaying Chinese political slogans that sing the praises of President Xi Jinping of China and his recent 19th Communist Party congress. But all are written in Chinese, so virtually nobody from Kazakhstan has a clue to the exultant message. Before entering the fenced-off special zone, visitors from Kazakhstan have to pass through Kazakh border controls, while those from China pass through Chinese checkpoints at the edge of the Chinese area. Each country trusts the other not to let in anyone who might cause trouble in the visa-free area. On visitors' way out, Kazakh customs officials are supposed to check that they are not carrying more than 50 kilograms, or 110 pounds, of goods from China. The weight restriction was imposed at the insistence of the Russia-dominated Eurasian Economic Union, a customs union of which Kazakhstan is a founding member. Russia worries that goods entering Kazakhstan duty free via the special trade zone will end up flooding Russian markets. Kazakhstan restricts each person to one shopping trip a month, but rampant corruption has made the checks sporadic at best. A long list of Kazakh officials, including police and customs officers, have been arrested over the years for running rackets that help people dodge customs duties. The former director of the Kazakh part of the zone, Vasily Ni, was dismissed after being accused of taking a $1 million bribe. The charges against him were later dropped, to widespread public dismay, as he had been caught on camera taking the money. The Chinese side, too, has been dogged by suspicions of financial shenanigans amid worries that the special development zone, which offers tax breaks to businesses that register there, is becoming a haven for Chinese companies eager to dodge taxes. Officials on both sides, however, insist the whole project is a triumph, with China pitching it as ""the door to Central Asia and a flourishing success."""
News,2018-01-08,"LOS ANGELES — Nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador who have been allowed to live in the United States for more than a decade must leave the country, government officials announced Monday. It is the Trump administration’s latest reversal of years of immigration policies and one of the most consequential to date.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/us/salvadorans-tps-end.html,1451," LOS ANGELES — Nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador who have been allowed to live in the United States for more than a decade must leave the country, government officials announced Monday. It is the Trump administration's latest reversal of years of immigration policies and one of the most consequential to date. Homeland security officials said that they were ending a humanitarian program, known as Temporary Protected Status, for Salvadorans who have been allowed to live and work legally in the United States since a pair of devastating earthquakes struck their country in 2001. Salvadorans were by far the largest group of foreigners benefiting from temporary protected status, which shielded them from deportation if they had arrived in the United States illegally. The decision came just weeks after more than 45,000 Haitians lost protections granted after Haiti's 2010 earthquake, and it suggested that others in the program, namely Hondurans, may soon lose them as well. Nicaraguans lost their protections last year. Immigrant advocates and the El Salvadoran government had pleaded for the United States to extend the program, as it has several times since 2001. A sense of dread gripped Salvadorans and their employers in California, Texas, Virginia and elsewhere. ""We had hope that if we worked hard, paid our taxes and didn't get in trouble we would be allowed to stay,"" said Veronica Lagunas, 39, a Salvadoran who works overnight cleaning offices in Los Angeles, has two children born in the United States and owns a mobile home. But the Trump administration has been committed to reining in both legal and illegal immigration, most notably by ending protections for 800,000 young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, beginning in March unless Congress grants them legal status before then. And despite its name, the administration says, the Temporary Protected Status program, known as T.P.S., had turned into a quasi-permanent benefit for hundreds of thousands of people. The Department of Homeland Security said that because damaged roads, schools, hospitals, homes and water systems had been reconstructed since the earthquakes, the Salvadorans no longer belonged in the program. ""Based on careful consideration of available information,"" the department said in a statement, ""the secretary determined that the original conditions caused by the 2001 earthquakes no longer exist. Thus, under the applicable statute, the current T.P.S. designation must be terminated."" The ending of protection for Salvadorans, Haitians and Nicaraguans leaves fewer than 100,000 people in the program, which was signed into law by President George Bush in 1990. It provides temporary lawful status and work authorization to people already in the United States, whether they entered legally or not, from countries affected by armed conflict, natural disaster or other strife. The homeland security secretary decides when a country merits the designation and can renew it for six, 12 or 18 months. There is no limit to the number of extensions a country can receive. Countries that have received and then lost the designation in the past include Bosnia and Herzegovina, which endured a civil war in the 1990s, and Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia during the Ebola crisis. El Salvador was one of the first countries in the program because of its civil war; that designation expired in 1994. The administration is giving Salvadorans in the program until September 2019 to get their affairs in order. After that, they no longer will have permission to stay in the country, forcing them into a wrenching decision. Ms. Lagunas said that she would remain in the United States illegally, risking arrest and deportation. But she would lose her job of 12 years without the work permit that comes with the protection. Her family would lose medical insurance and other benefits. ""There is nothing to go back to in El Salvador,"" she said, speaking in Spanish. ""The infrastructure may be better now, but the country is in no condition to receive us."" With his protected status, Carlos Jiron, another Salvadoran, started a small contracting business and won bids for big jobs, including to paint federal buildings in the Washington area. ""We have built a life here,"" said Mr. Jiron, 41, who lives with his wife and two American-born children in a four-bedroom house they bought in Springfield, Va. He will have to decide whether to take his children to El Salvador, where he says they would not maximize their potential and would face safety threats; leave them with guardians in the United States; or remain in the country at the risk of arrest and deportation as one of the millions of undocumented immigrants. His 14-year-old daughter, Tania, a fan of Disney movies and hip-hop music, said she could not fathom starting over in El Salvador. ""This is where I was born and am supposed to be raised,"" she said. Temporary protections were granted to Salvadorans who were in the United States in March 2001 after two earthquakes in January and February of that year killed more than 1,000 people and destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes. Over the next 15 years, the George W. Bush and Obama administrations extended the protections several times. In 2016, the final time, the government cited several factors, including drought, poverty and widespread gang violence in El Salvador, as reasons to keep the protections in place. El Salvador has rebuilt since the earthquakes. But the violence — San Salvador, the capital, is considered one of the most dangerous cities on Earth — has inhibited investment and job creation, and prompted tens of thousands to flee. The country's economy experienced the slowest growth of any in Central America in 2016, according to the World Bank. But officials in the Trump administration say the only criteria the government should consider is whether the original reason for the designation — in this case, damage from the earthquakes — still exists. Some lawmakers have introduced legislation to enable people with temporary protection to remain in the United States permanently. At the same time, instability in Venezuela has prompted some members of Congress from Florida to call for protected status for Venezuelans. The government of El Salvador had asked the Trump administration to renew the designation for its citizens in the United States, citing drought and other factors. Money sent home from Salvadorans abroad is a lifeline for many in the country, where four out of 10 households subsist below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. In 2016, the $4.6 billion remitted from abroad, mostly from the United States, accounted for 17 percent of the country's economy. El Salvador's president, Salvador Sánchez Cerén, spoke by phone with Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, on Friday to make one last plea. After Ms. Nielsen's decision was announced on Monday, Mr. Sánchez posted on Twitter, calling it an 18-month ""extension"" of T.P.S. The post prompted a flurry of angry replies accusing him of trying to spin the bad news. Flor Mejia, who works in a day care center on the outskirts of San Salvador, said her family gets by with the help of money sent regularly by her sister and brother-in-law, who recently bought a home and have two children born in the United States. Her parents live in Chalatenango, a rural province in the northern part of the country, and are subsistence farmers, growing corn and beans for the family's food supply. ""It's going to be very difficult for my parents, not having this income anymore,"" Ms. Mejia said. The United States Chamber of Commerce and immigrant advocacy organizations also had urged the administration to extend the protection, noting the Salvadorans' deep connections to America. According to an analysis by one group, the Center for Migration Studies, Salvadoran beneficiaries have 192,700 American-born children; 88 percent participate in the labor force, compared with 63 percent for the overall United States population; and nearly one-quarter have a mortgage. Donald M. Kerwin Jr., the center's executive director, called rescinding protection for Salvadorans a ""baffling ideological decision that is extraordinarily destructive on all ends. They are deeply vested and embedded in the U.S."" In Houston, the elimination of protected status would aggravate a labor shortage already delaying repairs after Hurricane Harvey, said Stan Marek, the chief executive of Marek Brothers, a large construction company with offices across Texas and in Atlanta. At least 29 Salvadorans on his payroll are program recipients. ""During hurricane recovery, I especially need those men,"" Mr. Marek said. ""If they lose their status, I have to terminate them."" But Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restrictions on immigration, said the Trump administration was correctly abiding by the original intent of the program. ""We need to put the 'T' back into T.P.S.,"" he said. ""It has to be temporary. This has gone on far too long."""

Here's what you need to know: • The Trump administration said that nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador who have been allowed to live and work in the U.S. since earthquakes devastated their homeland in 2001 must leave the country. The announcement came after Department of Homeland Security officials said they were ending a humanitarian program known as Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., ignoring pleas from immigrant advocates and the Salvadoran government to extend it. The move had its supporters. ""We need to put the 'T' back into T.P.S.,"" one said. Above, Veronica Lagunas and her two children. _____ • The Chinese authorities warned that an Iranian oil tanker, the Sanchi, that collided with another ship off China's coast could explode and sink. Rescuers were searching for the tanker's crew of 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis. Flames and thick black smoke were seen pouring from the Sanchi in images released by the South Korean Coast Guard and the Chinese state news media. Greenpeace said the accident may become an environmental disaster. _____ • Beijing's regulators are cracking down on Amway, the American marketing giant that found financial salvation in China, growing to more than $2.6 billion in revenue. Now, Amway and other companies that use sales representatives to recruit others below them — in what's called multilevel marketing — face public skepticism, and in some cases investigations. Amway's name in Chinese, an li, has even entered the vernacular to mean to ""promote heavily"" or to ""be brainwashed."" _____ • In Iran, President Hassan Rouhani used the recent nationwide protests to attack his hard-line opponents, saying the people who took to the streets did so because they were seeking a better life. Mr. Rouhani said the protesters objected not just to the bad economy but also to widespread corruption and the clergy-led government's restrictions on personal conduct. Even so, Iran over the weekend banned the teaching of English in primary schools after religious leaders warned that it opened the way to a Western ""cultural invasion."" _____ • A senior BBC News editor for China resigned, accusing the network of operating a ""secretive and illegal"" salary system that pays men more than women in similar positions. The editor, Carrie Gracie, who joined the BBC 30 years ago, said she only recently learned that her male colleagues earned 50 percent more than she did. She was offered a raise, but still not a salary matching her male counterparts. ""I simply want the BBC to abide by the law and value men and women equally,"" Ms. Gracie, above, wrote in an open letter posted online. _____ • A rousing call-to-arms by Oprah Winfrey capturing the #MeToo mood was the highlight of a Golden Globes ceremony that confronted the issues of gender equality and sexual abuse. ""What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have,"" Ms. Winfrey said, accepting a lifetime achievement award.

The Pantone Color Institute, which helps manufacturers select colors for designs, has been naming a color of the year since 2000 (It chose Greenery last year, and Rose Quartz — think millennial pink — shared the title with Serenity blue in 2016). This year the shade is Ultra Violet. ""We wanted to pick something that brings hope and an uplifting message,"" the institute's director, Leatrice Eiseman, told The Times. In ancient times, purple dye was made from the mucus of sea snails in the Phoenician city of Tyre, in what is now Lebanon's Mediterranean coast. Because the color was difficult and expensive to produce, it became associated with power and royalty, from ancient Rome to the kingdoms of Europe. In the 1500s, Queen Elizabeth I decreed that only members of the royal family could wear the color. In 1856, a British chemist, William Henry Perkin, made the color more accessible when he accidentally created a purple dye while trying to concoct a treatment for malaria. More than 160 years later, a color that's rare in nature is about to have its moment. For more on the color purple, read on.

News,2018-01-08,"In Indiana, Missouri and Pennsylvania, President Trump used the same promise to sell the tax bill: It would bring jobs streaming back to struggling cities and towns.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/business/economy/gop-says-tax-bill-will-add-jobs-in-us-it-may-yield-more-hiring-abroad.html,884," In Indiana, Missouri and Pennsylvania, President Trump used the same promise to sell the tax bill: It would bring jobs streaming back to struggling cities and towns. ""Factories will be pouring into this country,"" Mr. Trump told a crowd in St. Charles, Mo., in November. ""The tax cut will mean more companies moving to America, staying in America and hiring American workers right here."" The bill that Mr. Trump signed, however, could actually make it attractive for companies to put more assembly lines on foreign soil. Under the new law, income made by American companies' overseas subsidiaries will face United States taxes that are half the rate applied to their domestic income, 10.5 percent compared with the new top corporate rate of 21 percent. ""It's sort of an America-last tax policy,"" said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College in Portland, Ore., who studies tax policy. ""We are basically saying that if you earn in the U.S., you pay X, and if you earn abroad, you pay X divided by two."" What could be more dangerous for American workers, economists said, is that the bill ends up creating a tax break for manufacturers with foreign operations. Under the new rules, beyond the lower rate, companies will not have to pay United States taxes on the money they earn from plants or equipment located abroad, if those earnings amount to 10 percent or less of the total investment. The Republican vision for the tax plan was to make the United States a more competitive place to do business. Supporters contend that the new rules do not encourage companies to locate overseas. Rather, they say, slashing the corporate rate will make it more attractive to set up shop at home, since many other advanced economies now have higher taxes. And manufacturers do not simply follow their accountants' advice. They consider taxes, but they also look at an array of other factors, including the local talent pool and transportation network, when deciding where to build a new plant. Before the tax overhaul, companies had to pay the standard corporate tax on the money they earned abroad, with a top rate of 35 percent, but only when they brought that income back into the United States. Many corporations responded by keeping their profits abroad indefinitely. A record $2.6 trillion was in offshore accounts as of 2015, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a congressional panel. Republicans argued that the system deprived the American economy of investments that could have financed new ventures and hiring at home. It also meant that many multinationals effectively paid no American tax on their overseas earnings. The new bill, supporters point out, will prevent that from happening on such a large scale in the future. ""It's a vast improvement from what was on the books,"" said Ray Beeman, a tax lawyer at Ernst & Young who worked on a tax reform proposal that was a precursor to the current law when he was counsel to the House Ways and Means Committee, under Republican leadership, from 2011 to 2014. To prevent an exodus of businesses from the United States, the law establishes a minimum tax rate of 10.5 percent every year. Companies will get credit for up to 80 percent of the taxes they pay to foreign governments. But if the total still comes to less than 10.5 percent of the income they earn abroad, they have to make up the difference with a check to the American government. So while companies will now have to pay some tax in most cases, wherever they operate, they will pay much less on what they make abroad than at home. ""Having such a low rate on foreign income is outrageous,"" said Stephen E. Shay, a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School and a Treasury Department official during the Reagan and Obama administrations. ""It creates terrible incentives."" Mr. Shay said the new rule could make a big difference for small and medium-size companies, which make up a vast majority of American businesses. When those companies used to ask him whether to open offices abroad, he advised against it if they needed to bring their cash home. Such companies, Mr. Shay said, now have no reason to resist the temptation to shift some of their operations abroad, since they would end up paying half the rate they would pay in the United States. Some companies may not want to leave the comforts of home for a cut in their tax bill. Plants are expensive — they can cost more than $1 billion to buy and to outfit with the necessary industrial machinery. Manufacturers also gravitate toward stable, affordable locales where they can reach their customers easily and hire skilled workers. ""You may prefer to stay in the U.S., with the protections of our legal system, our infrastructure and our labor force,"" said Steven M. Rosenthal, an expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. On the other hand, for the biggest makers of cars and machines — the kinds of companies that Mr. Trump promised to lure back to the United States — a few percentage points in tax savings can be valuable. ""There are lots of great retail markets out there,"" Mr. Rosenthal said. ""The new rules might yet encourage jobs and factories to be shipped offshore."""
News,2018-01-08,"BENIN CITY, Nigeria — It had been 10 hours since he left Libyan shores, and Desmond Isaac was so close to Italy he felt like he could almost see it. Then, a Libyan Coast Guard vessel appeared and Mr. Isaac, a 32-year-old Nigerian who had sold all of his possessions to make it to Europe, was plucked from his rubber dinghy and taken back to the continent he thought he had escaped.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/world/africa/migrants-nigeria-libya.html,1281," BENIN CITY, Nigeria — It had been 10 hours since he left Libyan shores, and Desmond Isaac was so close to Italy he felt like he could almost see it. Then, a Libyan Coast Guard vessel appeared and Mr. Isaac, a 32-year-old Nigerian who had sold all of his possessions to make it to Europe, was plucked from his rubber dinghy and taken back to the continent he thought he had escaped. Mr. Isaac, whom Libyan officials detained, is one of around 7,000 Nigerian migrants the International Organization for Migration has returned home on chartered flights from Libya since January 2017. Efforts have intensified to bring more migrants home from Libya, an increasingly dangerous transit point many Africans pass through on their way to Europe. A recent CNN video showed what was described as sub-Saharan Africans being sold as slaves in auctions there. The migration organization is planning to fly home a further 20,000 migrants over the next few weeks, many of them Nigerian. And Nigeria has announced that it will begin arranging its own returns. Nigeria has long struggled to stem its outward flow of migrants as the job market struggles to keep pace with its booming population. Now, as masses of migrants return, the government faces a new challenge: what to do with them. ""As I'm sitting here, I'm still angry,"" Mr. Isaac, who left Nigeria in July and was returned in November, said in the parking lot of a run-down motel in Benin City, where the government has temporarily housed returned migrants who are from the area. ""I'm angry because I'm back in this jobless country."" Migrants and refugees who travel through Libya face abuse and exploitation at every turn. They are kidnapped, sold between captors, extorted and sometimes forced into prostitution and unpaid hard labor. Some Nigerian returnees said in interviews that their captors had made them dismember Libyan corpses and remove the bones. Others said they had been forced to unpack containers full of ammunition. Some were locked indoors for months. Those later held in official Libyan detention centers report having been beaten, sexually abused and denied food and medicine by guards. Amnesty International has accused the European Union of complicity in Libyan detention center abuses by supporting the Libyan Coast Guard's increasing efforts to intercept migrant boats. Despite the hardships of the journey, Mr. Isaac is among the recent returnees to Nigeria who do not feel as if they have been plucked from peril. Instead, they feel robbed of the possibility for a better life abroad. The migration organization's flights home back home are taken voluntarily, but economic migrants stuck in detention in Libya often don't feel like they have much of a choice. Nigeria is among Africa's largest economies, but its people still face many daily challenges, including a vast wealth gap, persistent corruption and a poor educational system. For decades, Benin City has served as a hub of human trafficking and a starting point for migration. Though much of the city is run-down, with poor roads and half-finished construction projects, there are expensive houses hidden behind gates, many built by those who had succeeded abroad. Still, poverty is widely on display, and young people in particular hustle in small businesses all day just to survive. Although the migrants are relieved to be out of Libyan detention, many worry that the push to bring them back home will not be followed by a sufficient effort to reintegrate them. Mr. Isaac worked as a truck driver in Benin City before he and two friends traveled to Libya last July, he said. Their ultimate destination: anywhere in Europe where they could find jobs. Those working to return migrants home say their motives are humane, even though many who borrowed money for the journey often find themselves back where they started — and with no way to pay it back. ""It's understandable they might feel annoyed or angry because that's when their debts become due, and suddenly they're wondering, did they do the right thing?,"" said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration. ""But getting people home from rubber dinghies in the sea in winter is far better."" With the support of the European Union, the migration organization is expanding reintegration and returnee support programs, including helping create more small businesses in Nigeria. But the more people they send home, the more overburdened those programs will become. Yinka Omorogbe, attorney general of Nigeria's Edo State, where Benin City is, estimates that up to 80 percent of returnees come from her area. Ms. Omorogbe said that the reintegration programs were a key part of the government's strategy to combat rampant human trafficking and that it planned to fund more of them, even if it continues to rely heavily on aid groups. Part of the strategy is to provide returnees with three-month stipends. ""We are very frugal,"" she said. ""We are doing the best we can."" One 29-year-old woman, who asked that her name not be used because her family and friends did not know what had happened to her abroad, said she had traveled first to Italy, in 2009, thinking she was going to work in a shop. Instead, she was trafficked into prostitution and forced to surrender her earnings to the woman who had brought her there, she said. When the Italian police caught her without papers and deported her, she said, she felt as if all of her hardship had been for nothing, and she immediately headed back. She was caught with false papers in Turkey and returned home. Eventually, the woman said, she signed up to learn catering through a local aid program. Now she makes cakes and doughnuts for events around Benin City and earns enough to rent a small room and save some money each month. Other migrants have had less success. Osas Onaiwu, who was traveling with Mr. Isaac when the Libyan Coast Guard caught them, has a wife and three children to support. He and his friends have already worked in the kinds of occupations that many of the aid groups offer training in — tailoring, catering and hairdressing. He and Mr. Isaac left on the migrant route, he said, because those jobs do not provide enough income for a family to survive in Nigeria. Now, with thousands of men and women like him returning home from Libya, still traumatized by the ordeal and frustrated that they had never made it to Europe, he is anticipating that desperation will drive some to the brink. ""Big crimes will happen,"" he said. ""Boys are now hungry, they're not happy. Men are not smiling. When you have kids, how will you feed them?"" All the while, other people are leaving Benin City to take the same dangerous route through Libya. Some have a hard time imagining they will face the same horrors migrants spoke about when they came home. But it is the success stories told around the city — accurate or otherwise — that keep their hopes alive. One man in Benin City, who asked for anonymity to protect his family from stigma, told the story of a sister who left for Italy in 2002 knowing full well she would work as a prostitute. It took her five years to pay off just half of the debt she owed for a plane ticket to travel there. But after a few years, the man recounted, she met an Italian man who paid off her remaining debts and married her. Soon, he said, she was sending money home. When her first daughter was born an Italian citizen a few years ago, the man said, she named her Osarhieme, which means ""God has given this to me."""
News,2018-01-09,A creator of the iPhone called the device “addictive.”,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/technology/apple-tech-children-jana-calstrs.html,1212," A creator of the iPhone called the device ""addictive."" A Twitter founder said the ""internet is broken."" An early Facebook investor raised questions about the social network's impact on children's brains. Now, two of the biggest investors on Wall Street have asked Apple to study the health effects of its products and to make it easier for parents to limit their children's use of iPhones and iPads. Once uncritically hailed for their innovation and economic success, Silicon Valley companies are under fire from all sides, facing calls to take more responsibility for their role in everything from election meddling and hate speech to physical health and internet addiction. ""Companies have a role to play in helping to address these issues,"" said Barry Rosenstein, managing partner of Jana Partners, an investment firm that wrote an open letter to Apple this weekend pushing it to look at its products' health effects, especially on children. ""As more and more founders of the biggest tech companies are acknowledging today, the days of just throwing technology out there and washing your hands of the potential impact are over."" The backlash against big tech has been growing for months. Facebook and Twitter are under scrutiny for their roles in enabling Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and for facilitating abusive behavior. Google was hit with a record antitrust fine in Europe for improperly exploiting its market power. But until now, Apple had escaped largely unscathed, and concerns about the deleterious effects of excessive technology use have not been among the most pressing matters for Silicon Valley executives. Jana, an activist hedge fund, wrote its letter with Calstrs, the California State Teachers' Retirement System, which manages the pensions of California's public-school teachers. When such investors pressure companies to change their behavior, it is typically with the goal of lifting a sagging stock price. In this case, Jana and Calstrs said they were trying to raise awareness about an issue they cared deeply about, adding that if Apple was proactive about making changes, it could help the business. ""We believe the long-term health of its youngest customers and the health of society, our economy and the company itself are inextricably linked,"" the investors said in the letter. Jana, which is often vilified for its aggressive focus on short-term profits, also said it would be raising a fund this year that would engage in more such campaigns, an effort that could help soften its image. Whatever the motivations, the two large investors are tapping into the growing anxiety among parents about their children's preoccupation with devices, at the expense of activities like reading and sports. ""Over the past 10 years, there's been a bottom-up backlash,"" said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of ""Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other."" ""You see it in things like people not sending their kids to schools that use iPads, and kids telling their parents to put their phones down."" For years, researchers have been sounding the alarm over the ubiquity of mobile phones and social media. A 2015 study by Common Sense Media, a research group that studies technology use, found that more than half of teenagers spent upward of four hours a day looking at screens, and that for a quarter of teenagers, the figure was more than eight hours. In another survey, in 2016, half the teenagers said they felt addicted to their mobile devices. ""These things can be incredibly addictive,"" said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped create the iPod and iPhone. ""It's amazing, but there are a lot of unintended consequences."" A growing roster of prominent technology executives have grown worried about the creations that brought them fame and fortune. Sean Parker, an early investor in Facebook, reflected on the sprawling influence of the social network. ""It literally changes your relationship with society, with each other,"" he said in an interview with Axios in November. ""It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains."" Evan Williams, one of the founders of Twitter, last year lamented the degree to which the messaging service had become a bastion for hateful speech. ""The internet is broken,"" he said. Chamath Palihapitiya, an early Facebook executive and the chief executive of Social Capital, a venture capital firm, said in November that he felt ""tremendous guilt"" about his role in building the social network. ""The short term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works,"" he said. ""No civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation, mistruth. And it's not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem."" By going after Apple, Jana and Calstrs, which together own about $2 billion worth of the company's stock, have selected the tech giant that is perhaps least dependent on its users' time. Because Apple makes most of its money selling hardware, rather than through digital advertising, it theoretically could afford to encourage its users to spend less time with its products. ""Apple's business model is not predicated on excessive use of your products,"" Jana and Calstrs said in their letter to the company. For this reason, said Ms. Turkle, the M.I.T. professor, ""it turns out that Apple is the company best positioned to act."" In a statement, Apple said that the parental controls already on its devices ""lead the industry"" and that ""we think deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them."" ""We take this responsibility very seriously,"" the statement continued, ""and we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations, especially when it comes to protecting kids."" Fears about technology addiction are not new. The BlackBerry, an early smartphone, was nicknamed ""CrackBerry."" Adam Alter, a social psychologist and the author of ""Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked,"" documents instances of internet addiction spanning the globe. But some tech executives now acknowledge that far from being an accident, their products were designed to be addictive. Mr. Parker said that when Facebook was getting started, the thought process was about ""how do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?"" Mr. Palihapitiya said as Facebook was rapidly growing, ""in the back, deep, deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen."" Mr. Fadell said that at the time Apple was designing the iPhone, ""we had no idea this was going to happen."" But, he added, people today are simply spending too much time looking at their phones. ""Now it needs to be addressed,"" he said. ""It's been 10 years in the making."" Even Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook and usually a staunch defender of his company's influence, has appeared more reflective in recent days. ""The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do — whether it's protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent,"" he said in a Facebook post last week. ""My personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues."""

This comes on the heels of the same rulings last year regarding Haitians and Nicaraguans. Salvadorans, however, are by far the largest group of T.P.S. recipients — approximately two-thirds of the remaining beneficiaries. Just like the decision to end the DACA program for nearly 800,000 undocumented childhood arrivals, the T.P.S. announcement is politically motivated and is probably an attempt to satisfy President Trump's anti-immigrant base. Although the choice to end a supposedly temporary program that has nonetheless lasted for 17 years may sound rational, the real-world consequences of such a wide-reaching move will be immediate and severe — and may even contribute to a new cycle of illegal immigration. Many, if not most, are unlikely to voluntarily return to a country that they no longer call home and instead may seek to stay illegally. The widespread fear instilled by this ruling, and the possible deportations to come, will tear apart families and communities. In effect, as of September 2019 there will be a group of newly unauthorized migrants living in the United States equivalent to the population of Salt Lake City. After almost two decades in the United States, Salvadoran T.P.S. recipients have built lives, communities and businesses. In many cities — above all Washington and Los Angeles — they are an important part of the economic and social fabric. They are parents to approximately 192,700 United States-born citizens. Ironically, if T.P.S. recipients are deported, a primary beneficiary will be one of President Trump's most-stated enemies: the MS-13 gang, which he has accused of turning United States communities ""into bloodstained killing fields."" The criminal organization, which is active in both the United States and El Salvador, traces its roots to instability after a wave of deportations from the United States in the 1990s, which El Salvador was ill equipped to receive. It didn't take long for the resulting instability to bounce back to the United States in the form of increased criminal activity and illegal immigration. A similar pattern could repeat itself, as conditions are only marginally better today. The Salvadoran government is already strained in its battle against corruption, crime and violence — including one of the world's highest homicide rates. MS-13 is almost certain to take advantage of the impending disruption as deportees arrive in El Salvador. Worse, young American citizens of Salvadoran origin will be left behind if their parents are expelled, making them more vulnerable to recruitment by criminal groups. This decision also has distinctly negative implications for El Salvador's already sclerotic economy. According to the Inter-American Dialogue's research, remittances account for 17 percent of the country's gross domestic product and a staggering 80 percent of economic growth. Last year, T.P.S. recipients alone sent over $500 million back to El Salvador. While the Trump administration may be tempted to see this as a benefit — preventing money from leaving the country — a sharp reduction in remittances would cripple longer-term United States efforts to build security and prosperity in El Salvador, investing more than $4.4 billion over the past 50 years. An economic downturn will only encourage a new exodus, fueling the cycle of instability and illegal immigration. To be sure, as President Trump has noted, responsibility for the problems with the current situation lies with the T.P.S. program itself. The administration is correct that the designation was intended to be temporary relief after a pair of earthquakes in 2001. In practice, however, past presidents routinely extended the program in part because of longstanding political, economic and security conditions in the country — which would only be made worse by ending the protection. Extending T.P.S. was a way to kick the can down the road and avoid facing real policy choices. Consequently, program recipients became more integrated into United States society every year, progressively raising the human costs of termination. Already there has been pushback on the decision from Democratic-leaning cities, states, members of Congress and other critics hoping for a legislative solution — which is highly unlikely. Even so, in the future Congress should aim to blunt the negative effects of this decision and create a new, more permanent designation for certain migrants from Central America and the Caribbean. Temporary protection is an essential tool to respond to short-term crises and disasters, but in this case — as in Haiti and Honduras — T.P.S. has not been sufficiently adaptive toward longer-term state weakness. The Trump administration's decision to pull the plug only creates more uncertainty and chaos. In doing so, the president has further eroded the United States' standing in Latin America and sowed bad will in significant communities that have contributed so much to this country and clearly embrace its values."
Editorial,2018-01-09,"For ordinary Iranians, the great promise of the 2015 nuclear deal was economic revival. International sanctions would be lifted, foreign investment would flow and the standard of living, crippled by years of ostracism by the United States and its partners, would rise, allowing Iran to once again flourish.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/opinion/iran-unrest-nuclear-deal.html,752," For ordinary Iranians, the great promise of the 2015 nuclear deal was economic revival. International sanctions would be lifted, foreign investment would flow and the standard of living, crippled by years of ostracism by the United States and its partners, would rise, allowing Iran to once again flourish. That hasn't happened, or at least not the way Iranians expected, thus producing conditions that helped make the recent protests — the most serious since 2009 — possible. Over two weeks, thousands of Iranians in more than 80 cities took to the streets to denounce high unemployment, inflation, corruption and the government's habit of spending money on foreign wars while cutting programs at home. As the unrest unfolded, President Trump blamed the 2015 nuclear deal negotiated under President Barack Obama because it required the United States to put millions of dollars back into the hands of a repressive government — money that belonged to Iran but was frozen after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and returned when Iran curbed its nuclear program. It's more plausible that by raising expectations for a better life, the deal opened Iranians' eyes and made them less tolerant when the government fell short. The deal has had a beneficial effect. The economy grew by 7 percent in 2016 and was expected to do so again in 2017, a far cry from the 9 percent shrinkage in the two years before March 2014, when modest sanctions relief took effect. Oil production is nearly at pre-sanctions levels, foreign companies are making new energy investments and Boeing has received orders for commercial aircraft. Nevertheless, growth and investment aren't doing enough to meet the needs of a population mainly too young to remember the Islamic Revolution. While low oil prices are a big factor in Iran's failure to rebound, so are corruption, mismanagement, a weak banking system, a failure to curb money laundering, a flawed rule of law and a record of human rights abuses, including arrests of American-Iranian businessmen, that make foreign companies reluctant to do business there. The hard-line Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and various religious institutions, which control much of the economy, are major impediments to reform. Now that some 22 people have been killed and at least 1,000 detained, the anti-government protests may be petering out without a clear indication of whether they will have a lasting impact. They certainly aren't the end of the struggle among Iranian hard-liners, determined to maintain rigid Islamic laws that dictate how people should live; moderates like President Hassan Rouhani, who advocate social liberalization and engagement with the West; and now, assuming the protesters stay engaged, an angry working class. On Monday, Mr. Rouhani came to the protesters' defense, saying they objected not just to a weak economy but also to widespread corruption and the clerical government's strict policies on personal conduct and freedoms. ""One cannot force one's lifestyle on the future generations,"" he said in remarks reported by the semiofficial ISNA news agency. All this reveals a real struggle for Iran's soul that requires an approach more sophisticated than Mr. Trump's, which would exploit the turmoil to justify reneging on the nuclear deal. That would free Iran to resume nuclear activities and enable new sanctions that would shift Iranian rage from Tehran to Washington. Some American officials and analysts want to go further and overthrow Iran's government. But Iran's future is for the Iranians to determine. The United States needs to be humble about what it doesn't know and cautious about more direct involvement in the country's politics. America has a troubled history with Iran, including overthrowing the country's democratically elected leader in 1953. Wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Vietnam are haunting reminders of America's failures at trying to orchestrate political and social change abroad. The question is not whether but how to help Iranians who favor nonviolent change. The United States, with its Western allies, should, of course, advocate the right of Iranians to seek peaceful political change, condemn the arrests of peaceful protesters and the violence against them, and urge internet companies to make it harder for Iran's leaders to block social media apps like Telegram that are so crucial to organizing and public debate. If he cares about the Iranian people, as he claims, Mr. Trump will also lift the ban on Iranians traveling to America. But the president should also be aware that foolish moves by his administration could empower the most regressive forces and set back reforms that could bring Iran fully into the community of nations."
News,2018-01-09,"WASHINGTON — In the wake of a deep economic crisis and a disappointingly slow recovery, a growing number of experts, including some Federal Reserve officials, say it is time for the Fed to consider a new approach to managing the economy.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/federal-reserve-inflation.html,1290," WASHINGTON — In the wake of a deep economic crisis and a disappointingly slow recovery, a growing number of experts, including some Federal Reserve officials, say it is time for the Fed to consider a new approach to managing the economy. Since the mid-1990s, the Fed has focused on keeping inflation slow and steady, at about 2 percent a year, in the belief that it was the best way to nurture economic growth and avoid painful downturns. Those pushing for a new approach do not agree on the best alternative — the ideas range from minor tweaks to tossing the current rule book — but there is broad agreement that the Fed should seize the moment now, before the next crisis hits. ""Monetary policy has not been as successful as we might like over the last decade,"" Christina Romer, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said this weekend at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Philadelphia. ""Now really is the time for every monetary economist to say, 'Is there something better?'"" The stakes are high: The Fed pursues its goals by raising and lowering borrowing costs to influence economic growth and stability. Effective management allows the economy to prosper: Employment grows, wages rise and people enjoy better standards of living. Mistakes cause recessions. The Fed has faced questions about its methods in the decade since the 2008 crisis, but in recent weeks, officials have shown a willingness to welcome the debate. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said it was time to talk about approach because the Fed is finally wrapping up its response to the last crisis, which entailed unprecedented steps to lower borrowing costs and get financial markets moving. ""The right timing of this debate is really now because the U.S. economy has fully recovered from this recession,"" Mr. Williams said. Patrick Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, told attendees at the economics gathering in Philadelphia that there was an urgent need for more and better research on the available alternatives. ""The most important issue on the table right now is that we need to consider the possibility of a new economic normal that forces us to re-evaluate our targets,"" he said. ""It is a question for the profession itself, and we do need people thinking about this."" The Fed's current approach is known as inflation targeting. It works in large part by training the public to expect a certain level of inflation, disciplining the pricing decisions of businesses and the wage demands of workers. It is, in other words, a self-fulfilling prophecy. The Fed announced in January 2012 that it would seek to keep inflation at a 2 percent annual pace, formalizing its implicit target since the mid-1990s. The rise of inflation targeting reflected a consensus among academics and policymakers that central banks did not have direct control over broader economic performance but did exercise direct control over inflation, and that keeping inflation low and stable was the best way to support growth. Most central banks in developed nations similarly target a low rate of inflation, taking the view that unpredictable increases in prices are economically disruptive. The European Central Bank, for example, aims to keep inflation ""below, but close to"" 2 percent. But the Fed's focus on inflation in the real economy did not prevent asset prices like mortgage-backed bonds from soaring to unsustainable heights before 2008, and concern about keeping inflation low limited the scope of its post-crisis stimulus campaign. Moreover, the combination of low inflation and modest growth has left the Fed with very little room to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates. During past downturns, the Fed lowered rates by an average of five percentage points. But the Fed's benchmark rate currently sits in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. That would make cutting the rate a less effective tool than in previous firefights. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's outgoing chairwoman, has emphasized that the Fed has other weapons in its arsenal. After 2008, the Fed bought large quantities of Treasuries and mortgage bonds and promised to keep interest rates low for years at a time, encouraging borrowing by businesses and consumers. Ms. Yellen is expected to be succeeded by Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor who is awaiting Senate confirmation as the next Fed chairman. Some outside economists say the Fed is putting a brave face on a bad situation. ""We are living in a singularly brittle context in which we do not have a basis for assuming that monetary policy will be able as rapidly as possible to lift us out of the next recession,"" said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary. The proposed alternatives to inflation targeting can be sorted into two categories. The first contains one simple idea: The Fed should permanently embrace higher inflation. The second is full of complicated ideas for temporarily embracing higher inflation during downturns. Olivier Blanchard, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who began his term as president of the American Economic Association at the Philadelphia meeting, said the choice of a 2 percent target had no particular economic logic to recommend it. Raising the target to 4 percent would give the Fed more room to operate without significantly larger economic costs, he said. Many economists, however, are wary of the simple solution. Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, has warned that the costs of dropping a new anchor would be significant. On Monday, at a Brookings Institution conference convened to discuss alternatives to the 2 percent target, Mr. Bernanke dismissed a 4 percent target as politically untenable. ""The Fed is not going to adopt a 4 percent inflation target,"" he said. ""It's just not going to happen."" But Mr. Bernanke has added his name to the list of those seeking an alternative to the current system. Last year, he proposed that the Fed should announce that it would temporarily tolerate higher inflation during future economic recoveries. A mechanized version of that idea, popular in some academic circles, would instruct the Fed to target an alternative economic measure, nominal gross domestic product, or N.G.D.P., which sums inflation and real economic growth. Under a 4 percent N.G.D.P. target, for example, the Fed would aim for a combination of inflation and growth that equaled 4 percent, such as 2 percent inflation and 2 percent growth. During a period of lower inflation, like the last decade, such a target would require the Fed to dictate more aggressive stimulus. Some are skeptical that the Fed can improve the economy by trying harder. Atif Mian, an economist at Princeton University, has argued in his research that high levels of household debt are limiting the impact of monetary policy because many households cannot or will not continue borrow. ""There is this implicit assumption that things will have traction if you just push hard enough,"" Mr. Mian said. ""But what is the mechanism through which this will raise actual G.D.P.?"" Indeed, the Fed and other central banks have not even succeeded in hitting their 2 percent targets in recent years, for reasons that remain unclear. Inflation in the United States has been below that level for the last six years, although most Fed policymakers continue to predict that higher inflation is around the corner. Ms. Romer said more ambitious targets might encourage central banks to try harder to stimulate inflation. In practice, she said, the Fed could have purchased more Treasuries and mortgage bonds as part of its response to the crisis, or even engaged in direct lending to businesses. ""We should not just assume that what we've done for the last 25 years is right,"" she said."
News,2018-01-09,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/travel/wellness-hotels-cruises-airports-2018.html,1106,"  What aspect of the travel industry won't wellness touch in 2018?  Perhaps none.  From hotels and cruises to airports, airlines, safaris and group tours, wellness promises to be everywhere in the world of travel. Five years ago wellness on the road meant heading to a destination spa to embark on a specific program such as weight loss or staying at a hotel with a nice gym; more recently, the concept has evolved to include all categories of travel, and encompasses overall physical and emotional health. The data to support the rising interest in wellness travel abounds.  According to the Global Wellness Institute, a nonprofit organization for the wellness industry, the wellness travel market grew to $563 billion in 2015 from $489 billion in 2013, and is expected to grow another 43 percent to $808 billion between 2015 and 2020. Travelers made 691 million trips with a wellness component, such as healthy eating or fitness, in 2015, 104.4 million more than in 2013.  In addition, in 2016, the luxury travel network Virtuoso launched Virtuoso Wellness, a portfolio of 42 hotels and cruise lines. The company's sales for these wellness partners (Rosa Alpina, in Italy's Dolomites Mountains, and Uniworld River Cruises are examples) were up 20 percent last year compared with sales for the company's other suppliers, which increased nine percent. Beth McGroarty, the research director for the Global Wellness Institute, said that the profusion of wellness programs in travel has redefined the purpose of a vacation. ""Vacations used to be associated with excess. You would have lavish meals, drink a lot and party,"" she said. ""In today's high-stress world, however, people are desperate for rejuvenation and are prioritizing wellness when they have time off.""  Leisure travelers looking to partake in a little — or a lot of — self-care are spoiled for choice, particularly in the hotel space where many of the big brands are incorporating wellness into guest rooms. Westin Hotels & Resorts has a growing roster of properties, including ones in Melbourne and Milan, that will feature WestinWorkout rooms, accommodations where guests have the choice of either an in-room treadmill or stationary bike.  In December, Four Seasons Hotel Los Angeles at Beverly Hills introduced seven wellness rooms in partnership with the wellness real estate company Delos. The amenities include toiletries from the beauty brand Lather that are made with natural ingredients, air purification systems that reduce allergens and promote restful sleep, showers with dechlorinators, and healthy in-room dining menus created in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic. A night's stay in a wellness room starts at $600 —$50 more than regular room rates — and the hotel's general manager, Michael Newcombe, said that the demand for them has been notable. ""Our regular clients asked us to bring wellness into the privacy of their rooms, and these new accommodations were our answer,"" he said. Cruises, too, are increasingly embracing wellness, especially by offering health-focused voyages: The adventure cruise line Linblad Expeditions, for one, in partnership with the exercise and spa brand Exhale, began a series of three- and four-day well-being trips (starting prices from $1,990 a person) in December around Mexico's Baja Peninsula. Guests on the journeys choose from activities like kayaking around the Baja coastline, snorkeling with sea lions and classes led by an Exhale instructor like power yoga and high intensity interval training.  Some travel companies are also offering more itineraries with wellness themes. Intrepid Travel will run 50 wellness-focused group trips this year, compared with 20 in 2017. One addition is the 12-day Golden Triangle: Yoga & Bollywood Edition (from $1,258 a person) in India that includes three days in the city of Rishikesh to practice yoga on the banks of the Ganges.  Intrepid has more wellness trips this year, according to the company's travel director, Leigh Barnes, because the number of travelers who booked them increased significantly in 2017 — in the United States alone, the jump was 88 percent from 2016. ""We're seeing that travelers who traditionally wanted to indulge on a vacation are now searching for trips that help them maintain their personal wellness,"" Mr. Barnes said. In the air travel space, both airlines and airports are stepping up their efforts in numerous ways toward keeping travelers healthy. Singapore Airlines, for instance, recently introduced Deliciously Wholesome, in-flight meals that were designed with the help of a nutritionist and are rich in complex carbohydrates, lean proteins and fiber. The dishes vary by class, but as an example, economy passengers can expect quinoa with ratatouille and chickpeas, and Oriental-style steamed fish.  Delta Air Lines offers guided meditation at its Asanda Spa Lounges in its Sky Clubs at John F. Kennedy International Airport and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Called Deepak Chopra Dream Weaver, the service can be booked for either 30 or 50 minutes, at a cost of $30 and $50 respectively, and is a light-and-sound experience in which fliers sit in a zero gravity chair and listen to a meditation led by Dr. Chopra.  Delta's service is limited to those who have access to Sky Clubs, but all travelers flying through Denver International Airport have the option of practicing meditation and yoga: Since last November, the airport's Concourse A has been home to Yoga on the Fly, a studio with five 60-square-foot rooms that offer iPads loaded with yoga and meditation sessions; fliers interested in trying a session can rent these rooms in increments of 15 minutes (the cost is $1 per minute). Avery Westlund, the company's co-founder and a certified yoga instructor, said she came up with the idea for Yoga on the Fly because her frequent travels left her physically and emotionally exhausted. ""Travel can be a grind, and yoga and meditation are simple and efficient ways to alleviate the stress,"" she said. The company expects to open locations at two more airports in the United States by early 2018.  Airports are a setting where travelers at least have the option to walk as a way to squeeze in some exercise, but traditional safari trips usually involve morning and evening game drives and few opportunities for activity. Now, some safari outfitters are breaking the same-old mold by giving travelers ways to keep fit.  The luxury company Micato Safaris provides its clients with a yoga mat, free weights and a jump rope. Runs through the bush in Kenya with Maasai warriors can also be arranged. And then there's a new 10-day private running safari in Kenya (from $7,850 a person), where travelers visit the high-altitude destinations of Eldoret and Iten to meet and train with elite runners.  ""Our clients were telling us that they didn't want to sacrifice their workouts while they were on vacation,"" said Melissa Hordych, the company's general manager. ""We've tried to help them by giving them creative and fun ways to move."" "

It was circle time, and Kelly was trying to get each of her 13 tiny students to articulate a feeling. ""Good morning, good morning, and how do you do?"" she sang softly to the little boy. ""Jamal's silly! Amir's happy! And how about you?"" Kelly's classroom was known for what one visiting specialist called its ""singsonginess."" The good-morning bit was standard fare, but Kelly also sang her own impromptu ditties throughout the day. She'd found that a good melody could cajole even her most obstinate students into completing dreaded tasks: There was a song about washing hands, and one about cleaning up messes, and another about how shouting and running were for outside only. Most children squealed with delight when their turn came to name a feeling: They offered up happys and sillys with abandon. Even the more bashful ones, who had to be prompted, were visibly thrilled by Kelly's attention, which seemed to beat out a limited toy-dinosaur collection as the class's chief attraction. But not the blond-haired boy. During the opening exercise, in which each child got a turn to dance in the center of the circle to a song of his choosing, he neither picked a song nor danced to the one Kelly offered. Instead, he flung himself at her feet and writhed like a fish out of water, then went completely still in a belligerent game of possum. Now, at least, Kelly had made eye contact. ""How are you today?"" she asked, holding both of his hands in hers as she spoke. ""Are you happy? Angry? Sad? Or silly?"" If any of her students — or ""little friends,"" as she called them — had sung her song back to her just then, Kelly would have answered that she was stressed. Three teachers had called out from work that morning, including the assistant teacher assigned to Kelly's room. Massachusetts state law prohibits the child-to-teacher ratio in full-day preschool classrooms from exceeding 10 to 1, so normally, Kelly had 13 students and one co-teacher. But staff shortages were a common occurrence at Springfield Arbors, where teachers earned $10 an hour on average and staff turnover was high. In practice, there was a lot of juggling: On any given day, students and teachers shuffled from one room to another, combining some classes and breaking others up in an effort to keep each room within the permissible ratio. That day, Kelly would absorb six additional students and one co-teacher from another classroom. The extra little ones didn't trouble her as much as the prospect of being stuck late again. She was supposed to be off by 4 p.m., but most of her kids didn't leave until 5:30, and the teacher who was scheduled to stay late was among those who were out. Of the teachers who were present, all either had children of their own to fetch from day care or night classes to get to at the community college. Kelly had neither. Her own kids were 17 and 20, and she had long since forgone higher education in favor of working. But none of that concerned the blond boy, who was blinking and smiling at her. Kelly kept her own eyes locked on his even as another student — a little girl with a devilish grin and a long dark ponytail — leapt onto Kelly's back and began tugging at her hairnet. ""How are you?"" Kelly asked the boy again. ""Can you tell me a feeling?"" The ponytailed girl was hardly the only one threatening to break the moment open. Someone was crying. Someone else was throwing toys not meant to be thrown and jumping on toys not meant to be jumped on. Someone smelled like poop and needed to be taken into the bathroom and guided through the basics of toilet use. And several someones were demanding things of Kelly specifically — that she hug them, or carry them round the room on her shoulders, or play a special game with just them. The children were ravenous for their teacher. And for each moment that she focused exclusively on the little blond boy, she risked losing the rest of her class to an irrevocable anarchy. To an outsider, it was tough to say which of the children's behaviors were normal for 3- and 4-year-olds and which were signs of bigger issues. Increasingly, classrooms like the one over which Kelly presides are being eyed by social scientists and policymakers as both the place where problems emerge and the safety net that stands the best chance of addressing them. Preschool is often thought of as mere babysitting. But a growing body of research suggests that when done right, it can be much more than that. An effective early-education program can level the playing field for low-income black and Hispanic students relative to their white or wealthier counterparts, so much so that gaps in language comprehension and numeracy can often disappear by the start of kindergarten. And according to at least two longitudinal studies, the very best programs can produce effects that reach far beyond those early years, increasing the rates of high-school completion and college attendance among participants and reducing the incidence of teenage parenthood, welfare dependence and arrests. The community Kelly taught in was low-income by all the standard metrics. Many of her students came from single-parent households — some from teenage mothers, at least one from foster care — and nearly all of them qualified for state-funded child care vouchers. Programs like Springfield Arbors that accepted such vouchers received about $35 a day for each child, enough to cover basics like food and art supplies but not enough to pay for on-site behavioral specialists or occupational therapists. The school did make referrals. By Massachusetts law, all 3- and 4-year-olds are eligible to receive special-needs services at the local public school; there is even a free shuttle to shepherd them back and forth. But the waiting list for those services can be long, and in the winter of 2016, few parents at the school bothered to put their children's names on it. So Kelly kept her own fractured vigil — taking note of which students couldn't control their emotions, or sit still for the life of them, or engage with others in a meaningful way — and giving those students whatever extra attention could be spared. She sometimes imagined the classroom as a bubble, inside which her students were temporarily spared from the hazards of everyday life. Her job, as she saw it, was to hold that bubble open for the ones who couldn't always hold it open themselves. ""Come on, my friend,"" she said now to the little blond boy. ""Talk to me."" The idea that we can deliberately influence the cognitive and social development of very young children is a fairly new one. In the early 20th century, some doctors considered intellectual stimulation so detrimental to infants that they routinely advised young mothers to avoid it. At the beginning of the 1960s, the prevailing wisdom was only slightly less dire. Trying to stimulate a very young mind wasn't considered dangerous so much as pointless, because 0-to-4-year-olds were ""concrete thinkers,"" incapable of theorizing or abstraction. But such thinking began to shift with two seminal preschool experiments: the HighScope Perry Preschool Study, which began in 1962 in Ypsilanti, Mich., and the Carolina Abecedarian Project, which began in 1972 in and around Chapel Hill, N.C. Perry provided free half-day classes and weekly home visits to 58 black children living in a high-poverty district near Detroit. Abecedarian provided 57 children of a similar cohort with full weekday care for their first five years of life, including not only preschool but also health care and social services. Both programs employed highly trained teachers and kept student-to-teacher ratios low. The Perry study also used a curriculum rooted in ""active participatory learning,"" in which cognitive and social skills are developed through educational games that the children themselves initiate and direct. The short-term results of these interventions were mixed. Some of the preschoolers, for example, were more aggressive at the end of the programs than they had been at the start, even if this difference disappeared by second grade. Decades later, however, when researchers went back, they found a surprise. At age 21, the Abecedarian children were half as likely to have been teenage parents and 2.5 times more likely to have enrolled in college than the control group, who did not attend preschool. At 40, the Perry children had higher median incomes than their control-group peers; they were less likely to be on welfare and less likely to have been arrested. Those results were not uniform. For example, while Perry seemed to reduce arrests and increase high-school graduation rates, Abecedarian had no impact on either. But the findings still caused a stir among social scientists and educators: Both programs appeared to have affected the children in ways that could still be seen in adulthood. In the decades since those results were published, the biological and social sciences have radically altered our understanding of early-childhood development. We now know that infants and toddlers have the capacity for complex thought. According to a recent report from the Institute of Medicine, they can understand other people's intentions, reason about cause and effect and intuit the more basic aspects of addition and subtraction. We also know that the earliest years are a period of intense and rapid neural development — M.R.I. studies suggest that 80 percent of all neural connections form by age 3 — and that a child's ability to capitalize on these years is directly related to her environment. Social scientists have shown that, owing to a shortage of books and toddler-friendly conversation, children from families on welfare understand roughly one-third the number of words that their middle-class peers do by the start of kindergarten. Scientists and educators have begun to build on this new understanding, creating pedagogy and designing curriculums around the needs of our earliest learners. But one crucial question remains unanswered: What actually works? What are the defining features of an excellent preschool education? ""There is no empirically based definition of 'high-quality preschool,' "" says Mark Lipsey, a social scientist at Vanderbilt University. ""We throw the phrase around a lot, but we don't actually know what it means."" Part of the problem is that the benefits of a preschool education tend to manifest unevenly. Developmental gains made by the start of kindergarten can be enough to close racial achievement gaps, but those gains often evaporate by third or fourth grade, a phenomenon that education researchers call the fade-out effect. And so far, the longer-term rebounds found in Perry and Abecedarian — in which children who attend good preschools fare better in adulthood than their peers who attend no such program — have been difficult to parse or replicate. In 2017, a group of prominent early-education researchers published a consensus statement declaring that preschool classrooms were a ""black box"" and that much more research was needed before anyone could say with certainty which ingredients were essential to improving long-term developmental trajectories. Amid that uncertainty, though, at least two things seem clear: Children in low-income and minority neighborhoods stand to gain (or lose) the most from whatever preschool system we ultimately establish. And the one-on-one exchanges between students and teachers — what developmental psychologists call ""process quality"" — may well be the key to success or failure. In other words, if preschool classrooms really are crackling with the kind of raw power that can change the course of a life, that power most likely resides in the ability of teachers like Kelly to connect with students like the little blond boy. But if teachers are crucial to high-quality preschool, they are also its most neglected component. Even as investment in early-childhood education soars, teachers like Kelly continue to earn as little as $28,500 a year on average, a valuation that puts them on par with file clerks and switchboard operators, but well below K-12 teachers, who, according to the most recent national survey, earn roughly $53,100 a year. According to a recent briefing from the Economic Policy Institute, a majority of preschool teachers are low-income women of color with no more than a high-school diploma. Only 15 percent of them receive employer-sponsored health insurance, and depending on which state they are in, nearly half belong to families that rely on public assistance. ""Teaching preschoolers is every bit as complicated and important as teaching any of the K-12 grades, if not more so,"" says Marcy Whitebook, a director of the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. ""But we still treat preschool teachers like babysitters. We want them to ameliorate poverty even as they live in it themselves."" The solution to this paradox seems obvious: Hold preschool teachers to the same standards as their K-12 counterparts, and pay them a salary commensurate with that training. But that proposition is rife with intractable questions. Who will pay the higher salaries? How will current teachers rise to meet the new credential requirements? And if they can't or won't, who will take their place? At the heart of those questions is this one: What, exactly, makes a good preschool teacher? Springfield Arbors preschool consists of one long hallway on the ground floor of an assisted-living facility, with several classrooms strung along either side. The surrounding neighborhood, known as Six Corners, is home to a high school (the same one that Kelly attended), a community college and a steady beat of drug- and gang-related violence. Six Corners children live on the down side of what's known in education circles as the achievement gap. According to analysis done by the Massachusetts-based nonprofit Strategies for Children, between 12 and 14 percent of third graders in some Six Corners schools read at or above grade level, compared with between 37 and 43 percent in nearby Forest Park, a neighborhood known for its well-preserved Victorian homes, and as the birthplace of Dr. Seuss, the city's most famous native son. Kelly came to preschool teaching about a decade ago, when the local caterer she was working for abruptly shut down. For a single mother with a high-school diploma, the options in Springfield were limited: Home health aides, retail salespeople and food-service workers all made about the same salary. Receptionists and secretaries made more, but those jobs required office experience, and the work itself sounded dull. Kelly wanted a job helping people. She had only ever worked in food service, but when she found a local preschool with an opening in the kitchen, she saw a chance to pivot. She started by making herself known in the classroom, lingering to help out when she delivered lunches, introducing herself to parents in the hallway, befriending the teachers and asking them about their work. When an assistant-teacher spot opened up, she jumped on it. She considered it a promotion, even though the teacher's salary ($9 an hour) was actually $1 an hour less than what she made as a school cook. For the first year, she split her time between the kitchen and the classroom while she earned her Child Development Associate certification, or C.D.A., which required her to complete a nine-month course that met for four hours every Saturday at the local Y.M.C.A. At first she thought that credential would help her carve a path to some greater edification: a higher degree, maybe, and a higher wage along with it. But those dreams were quickly jettisoned. In 2011, just as she was completing her first class at the community college, an electrical fire tore through the three-family home that Kelly and her two children shared with her grandmother, mother, aunt and cousin. Her relatives' apartments weren't damaged much, but Kelly and her children lost nearly all their possessions. Worse, the fire seemed to usher in a newly dark chapter in her life. In 2012, her younger brother died in a horrific car accident; a year later, her cousin was shot and killed, and her aunt died. Her daughter's boyfriend — the father of her newborn grandson — was also killed, in another shooting. Somewhere in the middle of those heartaches, the preschool she worked at closed, and Kelly moved on to Springfield Arbors. The C.D.A. taught her the basics of lesson planning, class structure and family engagement, but her real training came through trial and error. Kelly's classroom was often chaotic, but parents quickly learned that they could come to her with concerns, even after their children had aged out of her classroom. One mother asked her to step in as foster parent during a particularly tough time. Others hired her to babysit when they picked up night shifts at one job or another, so that Kelly might welcome a given child at 8 in the morning and not return him to his mother until well after 10 or 11 at night. The work was exhausting, but she found she had a knack for it — an instinct for what her students needed, an ability to relate to them and, when all else failed, a willingness to keep trying. One early-spring afternoon, when a rainstorm kept the children indoors during what would normally be playtime, Kelly tried arranging a field trip to the basement hallway — the only substitute playground at Springfield Arbors. But when too many of them fell into tantrum mode at the same time, she changed tack and set up the portable chalkboard at the front of the room. It did not take long for one, then three, then a dozen of the children to notice her chalking letters and gather around. The letter of the week was ""D,"" and she had been teaching the students what words it was used in and showing them how to write and pronounce it. ""Down, over, over,"" she said in a long, slow drawl, as she drew first the spine and then the hump of the letter. She was speaking to one little boy specifically, and when she was done, she handed the chalk to him and held his hand as he repeated her movements. Then she removed her hand and nodded at him to try on his own. At first, the class was enthralled by this demonstration. But then one little boy started screaming. Grandma, an elderly volunteer who sometimes came for an hour or two and mostly sat in back of the room on a small couch, grabbed the boy's arm and yanked him to her side. ""Cut it out,"" she said. ""Come sit!"" The boy yanked his arm back, flopped onto the floor and wailed. Kelly kept her focus on the students at the blackboard. Eventually the screamer ran back over to the circle and forced another little boy off his seat, which made the other boy cry, which distracted the rest of the class and set half of them wandering off, before anyone had made a full D. When nap time came it seemed impossible that any one of the tiny, furious bodies twirling through the room could be stilled long enough to let sleep come, let alone all of them at once. But the sleeping mats were soon laid out across the room, and the children took their cue, except for the little blond boy, who wouldn't lie still. One of Kelly's colleagues sat on the floor near him, urging him to calm himself. ""Relax your body,"" she said over and over, patting his back. But it was no use, so she traded spots with Kelly. Kelly leaned over the little blond boy and made eye contact with him and allowed him to grab at her hands with his. This seemed to do the trick. When he settled in just enough to release his grip, she took her cellphone out and played soft music, just for him, which clinched the deal. By the time all the children fell asleep, Kelly was sitting cross-legged on the floor with four little ones unfurled like flower petals around her. She was rubbing each of their backs in turn with one hand — rub, rub, pat, next; rub, rub, pat, next — while rocking a fifth in her other arm. Her classroom had a total of 19 students just then, and in order for her to grab lunch, the school's cook had to be summoned to sit with the sleeping children. She pulled a pack of noodles from her coat pocket and tiptoed toward the door. ""It's a ramen week,"" she whispered. ""I just spent a fortune on household stuff yesterday, and my son has two basketball games this week."" The high school charged $5 admission to each game, and Kelly rarely missed one, even when it meant skimping on meals. She returned a few minutes later with a bowl of steaming noodles and two co-teachers. As the children snoozed, the three women slipped into a whispered chat. One student's voucher was about to expire, and the student's mother had yet to contact the voucher office to renew it. They debated who was to blame for this looming catastrophe; but how the voucher office worked was a mystery, even to these women who were both mothers and teachers. ""You can't call them,"" one teacher said. ""They never answer. You have to go down there."" ""She must have missed her appointment,"" another added. ""They don't always give appointments,"" Kelly said. ""They never gave my daughter one for my grandson."" One teacher, Miss RJ, was summoned to the office: The nurse at her own children's school was calling to say that both of them were sick. But Springfield Arbors was still short-staffed. So Miss RJ was stuck there, and her own children were stuck with someone else. In the United States, the care of children who have not yet aged into public school has long run on two tracks, separated mostly by household income. The upper-and-middle-income track was designed specifically to engage and nourish young minds at their ripest juncture. The low-income track originated in the social-welfare system; its programs were created not just for children but also for their mothers, who needed to work. As such, they tend to be larger and staffed by teachers with high-school diplomas. They also tend to be chronically underfunded. The last half-century is littered with attempts to merge these two tracks — that is, to make the day cares of the poor more like the preschools of the middle class and wealthy. But those efforts have long been plagued by a deep cultural ambivalence toward both charity and working mothers. When Head Start, the nation's first public preschool, began in 1965 as part of the War on Poverty, its goals were twofold: to provide underprivileged preschoolers the tools they needed to keep up with their better-off peers; and to offer an economic boost for their mothers, some of whom were recruited and trained to work at the centers as educators. The program was part of what would come to be known as the country's biggest peacetime mobilization of human resources, but enthusiasm for it was short-lived. Amid concerns about ""family weakening"" in the 1970s and ""welfare queens"" in the 1980s, funding for early education stalled. Today Head Start serves less than one-third of the nation's eligible students. As part of a wave of reforms about a decade ago, Head Start began requiring half of its lead teachers to hold bachelor's degrees. It's too soon to tell what impact this has had on teaching and learning, but one unintended consequence is that it's harder for teachers like Kelly to find work at the centers. Head Start is not the only program to raise credentialing requirements for preschool teachers. In 1998, as a result of a lawsuit filed by the Education Law Center, an advocacy group for New Jersey public-school children, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered 31 low-income school districts to provide high-quality preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds. Among other things, the court's definition of ""high quality"" included full-day programs staffed by college-educated teachers who earned salaries equal to those of their K-12 counterparts. The resulting program — known as the Abbott preschool program, after the lawsuit that led to the mandate — represents one of the first efforts among education reformers to replicate the models of Perry and Abecedarian and bring them to scale. One recent morning in a brightly colored classroom at Egenolf, an Abbott preschool in Elizabeth, N.J. A 3-year-old girl with soft brown pigtails and a white shirt examined a row of water bottles, each of which had a pine cone submerged in a different liquid, and dictated observations to her teacher, Yamila Lopez Hevia. The cone in the ""cold water"" bottle was closing up. The one in warm water was closing, too — but more slowly. ""And what do we think is going on?"" Lopez asked. ""Why might that happen?"" After a brief pause, the girl pulled up two big words, each of which she had heard from Lopez. The pine cones, she explained, were a-dap-ting to their en-viron-ment. It was the crowning moment to a much larger project that began when the children noticed that it was getting colder out and that the leaves were changing color. Lopez led them through a dialogue about how trees and other plants get ready for winter. From there, they turned their attention to what animals do. Lopez took the class to a local park, where they noticed squirrels collecting nuts and looked for birds who might be getting ready to migrate. In the end, they circled back to themselves, discussing sweaters and warm coats and winter boots. ""We introduced some big concepts,"" Lopez told me when I visited her class recently. ""And it all started with that one simple question: 'What do you see happening around you?' "" The technique was called scaffolding, and it was a key tenet of current preschool pedagogy, which Lopez learned as a student teacher. According to that pedagogy, preschoolers discover the world around them through trial, error and experimentation. They learn by doing things more than by thinking about them. The techniques that educators and developmental psychologists have devised for cultivating this natural tendency are decidedly Socratic. Rather than standing at a blackboard chalking letters or leading a large group in song, they assert, teachers like Kelly and Lopez should pay close attention to what the children themselves are interested in, or puzzled by, and respond to that. Any given moment is ripe with the opportunity to teach in this way, but doing it well requires a suite of disparate skills. A squirrel collecting nuts for the winter might hold a biology lesson; but to offer that lesson, a teacher needs to recognize the moment as it occurs. She also needs a grounding in that discipline and a clear sense of where the student in question sits on the developmental spectrum. ""The bottom line is really individualized intentional teaching,"" says Steven Barnett, co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University. ""And there's specialized knowledge that preschool teachers need that's different even from what kindergarten and first-grade teachers need."" For example, he says, preschoolers are apt to reverse letters. ""It really helps to understand why they do that, if you want to help them get it right,"" he says. ""It's not an isolated thing. Like, let's take my sippy cup. My whole life up to now, my sippy cup is a sippy cup no matter what way I hold it — upside down, sideways, whatever. But now you give me this thing called a d. And I put it down one way and it's a b. And another way and you tell me it's a p. What's with that?"" Barnett and others say that the ability to guide preschoolers through this stage of development takes a college degree. Teachers who don't have rich vocabularies or groundings in math and science can't impart those things to their students, he says. In a 2015 report, the Institute of Medicine agreed. The report argued that holding preschool teachers to lower standards than public-school teachers has fed the perception that the work itself is low-skill and in turn has helped justify policies that keep preschool teachers' wages down and prevent them from growing professionally. But teachers themselves have been divided over the prospect of new job requirements. Many of them migrated to the field precisely because it did not require a higher degree. College — navigating financial aid, carving out the hours for class and homework — takes time and money and know-how. And for those who have been doing the job for years or even decades, the suggestion that they need additional training can feel like an insult. Abbott addressed these issues head-on. It provided intensive college-admissions counseling, including help with financial-aid forms and scheduling. It also covered tuition for teachers in the program and nudged the college programs to bring their classes to the preschools. ""We had the college professors go into the Newark schools and hold their classes there so that the teachers didn't have to travel,"" Barnett says. ""We also paid for substitutes when the teachers needed to go to classes during the day, because we knew that not everybody could do this at night school."" The process was neither cheap nor easy nor fast, he adds. Many teachers struggled through remedial courses and community college before making their way into bachelor's degree programs. All told, it costs $14,000 per child per year, more than twice the national average. Those figures have made Abbott a lightning rod in the debate over public preschool in general and teacher credentials in particular. Critics say that the program is far too expensive given how little it may affect student outcomes in the long term (Abbott studies show fade-out effects, albeit less significant ones than in many other preschool studies). But proponents argue that it's unfair to judge the success or value of such programs by performance in the middle-school or high-school years — in part because there may be rebound effects later on. And in any case, the program works demonstrably well in achieving its primary objective: preparing children for elementary school. It has also helped stabilize the preschool work force. Because Abbott teachers earn solid middle-class salaries — between $55,000 and $57,000 per year on average — staff turnover is less of a problem, which in turn means that classrooms are less chaotic. This latter benefit underscores all the others: A successful preschool teacher needs to make her students feel safe and help them understand their emotions and regulate their own behavior. Children can't concentrate long enough to absorb new ideas or develop new skills if every slight sets them off crying or swinging at other children, or if they feel constantly threatened or mistrustful of their surroundings. And teachers who earn poverty-level wages can't be expected to create consistent and reassuring classrooms. ""Security is an essential foundation for early learning,"" says Whitebook of U.C. Berkeley. ""An older kid might be able to learn about math or history from a teacher they don't like. But a young child, a preschool-aged child, is going to have a very hard time learning anything from an adult that they feel averse to. For very young children especially, you have to meet them where they are, both literally and figuratively, and you have to make them feel safe in that space."" Little of what experts like Barnett and Whitebook espouse would surprise Kelly, who in the time I spent in her classroom seemed always to be on bended knee, talking one child or another through their tears, gently but firmly explaining the reality of other people's feelings or helping them understand the relationships between their physical behavior and its consequences. One day, I watched her spend a full 15 minutes on a small boy in bright orange shorts who had gotten in the habit of tearing through the room at full speed. In the course of a morning, he had knocked two little girls to the ground and destroyed a block city that two other children were building. The assistant teacher had threatened him with suspension from class, to no avail. Kelly, applying the same squat-down-direct-eye-contact treatment that she used on the blond-haired boy, led him through a string of questions: ""What happens when we run?"" ""We go fast!"" ""What else happens?"" ""We ... hit things?"" ""Why do we hit things when we run fast, but not when we walk?"" ""Because ... it takes longer to stop!"" From there they discussed how barreling into a person might make that person feel. Eventually the boy concluded that it was best to save fast running for outside, where there was more space. It was as good a lesson in physics and feelings as any 4-year-old was likely to get, in any school. But later that day, the same little boy found himself puzzling over another riddle of movement and speed. It was recess, and the class was scattered across the narrow strip of wood chips and strewn toys that constituted the Springfield Arbors playground. The boy in orange shorts huddled with three other boys in a cubbyhole at the base of a plastic fort. The group whispered and drew in the dirt with twigs for several minutes before abruptly bursting out across the yard. They took possession of a large rubber ball from some uninterested girls and set about throwing it as high as they could. The boy in the orange shorts took several consecutive turns, throwing the ball higher each time. When it landed atop a tarp that was fastened to the side of the building, the boys exchanged giddy confused looks: Why had the ball landed there instead of on the ground? What should they do next? The boy looked across the playground toward Kelly, but she was busy brokering a time-share deal between two archrivals over the class's only Malibu Barbie. If there was a shortcoming to Kelly's work, it was that her skills were almost always deployed to resolve a crisis or defuse tension, and rarely to nurture some budding curiosity. Kelly didn't doubt the vastness of her students' inner mental worlds; nor did she discount the importance of meeting them where they were or of treating them with frankness and intelligence. In fact, she seemed to grasp those principles intuitively. What she lacked was the support she needed to build on her natural talents or cultivate her own ambitions. One such ambition was taking more of a leadership role at the center. In April 2016, she was unofficially promoted from lead teacher to assistant director — an office job that came with a small raise. But then in June, two teachers quit and another was fired, and she was sent back to the classroom. ""I feel like I can't move forward,"" she told me at the time. ""I keep picking up slack for all these other people moving forward with their careers, and their lives. And I'm stuck."" That feeling had become more pronounced lately, owing to a string of incidents outside the classroom. First was the robbery: When she and her daughter stopped at the bank one evening after work, they were held at gunpoint by a man in a ski mask demanding all the money behind the counter. The entire episode passed in 15 minutes. But while Kelly's daughter compartmentalized it quickly, Kelly replayed it in her head for weeks, enumerating to herself all the ways that trouble had nearly missed them: She did not normally stop at that branch, but had taken a different route home to run an errand. They had been about to leave; Kelly's hands were on the door when the gunman came through it from the other side, thrusting his weapon in her face. He was never caught, but the Springfield Police Department sent the Kelly household a pamphlet on how to deal with the aftermath of a robbery. Then, as summer approached, Kelly received a summons asking her to testify in a murder trial. The actual killing took place in 2013, on her brother's birthday. It was the first of his birthdays since his death, and Kelly and her sister were sitting up in her sister's kitchen, weathering the internal storm that such anniversaries tend to bring, when they heard shots. Kelly looked down from the second-story window to find a gaggle of teenagers, including her nephew, scrambling for cover. She grabbed every glass object she could get her hands on — plates, vases, dishes — and hurled them out the window at the gunman, ducking in between throws to protect herself. When the shooting stopped, she and her sister ran out to the street, where they found one boy down. Kelly gave him CPR, and even got him back to breathing for a few minutes, but he died before the ambulance arrived. In addition to reminding her of that day, the court summons had the effect of putting her children on edge; there had already been more than one shooting in their neighborhood that summer, and it was never good to be the only person standing between an accused killer and a possible life sentence. Kelly prided herself on setting those worries aside when she was at work. But with each fresh calamity, she felt the walls of her own bubble closing in. One late afternoon, as fall tipped into winter, a squirrel perched itself on the ledge just outside Kelly's classroom window and caught the attention of a small boy with milk-chocolate skin and big, round eyes. He pointed at the animal, silently but with gusto. When Kelly walked by, he tugged at the leg of her pants. She scooped him up, rested him on her hip and, for a brief moment, watched with him as the creature scurried up and down a tree at the playground's edge. ""Yes,"" she said. ""That's a squirrel."" The boy continued to point, but it was late in the day, and Kelly was tired and distracted, so the conversation ended there. In the fall of 2017, Kelly and her colleagues received word that Springfield Arbors preschool would change owners this January, and become Bright Futures. No one could say for sure what that meant for the teachers or their students. The anxiety surrounding this change reflected an uncertainty that reached far beyond Kelly's classroom. In the last decade or so, the percentage of children served by state programs has doubled; 43 states and the District of Columbia now have public preschool programs of one kind or another. But that recent progress is now being tempered by federal indifference: The Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has yet to appoint a director of the Office of Early Learning, established under the Obama administration to help facilitate the integration of preschool into the public-education system; and President Trump has eliminated preschool funding increases from his proposed budget. What's more, experts are still divided over what credentials early childhood educators should have. Last year, for instance, the District of Columbia school district took a step toward professionalizing its preschool work force when it declared that all preschool teachers would be required to obtain an associate degree by 2020. The measure met with controversy even among some preschool proponents. One argument holds that preschool teachers with college educations have not been shown to improve students' educational outcomes compared with those who do not have degrees but have been trained in child development. ""The evidence for a B.A. is pretty weak,"" says Bruce Fuller, an education researcher at U.C. Berkeley. ""It probably screens for people who engage in richer language, but the actual training in college — I'm not sure it has any effect."" The other argument is that increasing credential requirements without first raising wages places too much of a burden on already-overtaxed teachers. Mary Alice McCarthy, director of the Center on Education and Skills at the New America foundation, has proffered a different approach: apprenticeships. Like many human-service jobs, she says, teaching is best taught through ""iterative interactions,"" where a person with experience helps a newcomer identify and respond to challenges. And the structure of an apprenticeship may be better suited to teachers who need to work full time while they learn. ""You can't say the goal is to level the playing field for low-income kids,"" McCarthy says, ""and then cut low-income teachers who have been doing this work forever out of the equation."" Amy O'Leary, a former preschool teacher and current campaign director for Strategies for Children, agrees: ""The existing preschool work force is much more diverse than the elementary work force, and we want to preserve that,"" she says. ""If you hire only those teachers who have the means to do it on their own, you displace the existing ones, who often come from the communities they teach in and have their own specialized knowledge of what it is to live in neighborhoods like Six Corners."" A Philadelphia-area community college, a union and a number of local preschools joined forces to make the first attempts at training preschool teachers in this way. The program pairs apprentice teachers with mentors as they progress through a structured curriculum while working in the classroom full time. They get four wage increases over a two-year period, so that by the time they complete the program, which grants them both an associate degree and a journeyman card, they are already earning $2 to $3 more an hour. ""That's a life-changing increase,"" McCarthy says. It's also classroom-changing. The program is still in its infancy, but I spoke with apprentices, teachers and center directors who say that improvements in classroom dynamics and staff turnover, not to mention actual teaching, are already apparent. ""I feel like I've learned more about how their little brains work, and also about the best ways to reach them,"" says Briana Gonsiewski, an apprentice at Spin preschool in Philadelphia, who taught for 10 years before joining the program in 2017. ""Before, I did not see playing on the ground as something structural. Now I get how they are really learning all the time, and I can start to see how to tap into that."" It will take a few years more to say how the apprentice program stacks up against programs like Abbott, or even like Springfield Arbors, and if the teacher training affects student outcomes in any measurable way. And then individual communities will have to decide if the gains are worth the price. ""We have to come to terms with the fact that this is going to cost a lot more money,"" O'Leary says. ""And to accept that, I think we still have to shed a lot of prejudices about working mothers and the working poor, and what it means to help them."" In the meantime, with limited funds, policymakers and educators are caught between competing imperatives: Use the money they have to expand access so that as many students as possible receive some form of early education, or use it to improve quality in specific places like Six Corners, where both the need and potential payoff are greatest. Investing in teacher education, as Abbott or the apprenticeship programs do, means choosing the latter, and that's a tough sell to taxpayers who need child care themselves. ""Politicians are understandably reluctant to tell parents who need to work and who are on the waiting list for subsidies, 'Well, we're not going to expand access this year, because we are putting that money into quality,' "" Barnett says. ""It's true that the lowest-income areas stand to benefit the most from good preschools. But it's not just the very poor that are struggling. The story of inequality is increasingly that the very rich are leaving everyone else behind."" For now, Kelly and hers were making do. Her son was accepted at six of the 10 colleges he applied to. He had qualified for some scholarship money, which would help bring his tuition down, but Kelly was scrambling to come up with the rest. She had found a second job working nights and weekends at Kohl's, and was cutting corners where she could. One such economy was her car: a 2001 Buick Park Avenue, bought from a friend for $700. The engine was solid, but the gas meter was busted, so that you had to pay very close attention to the amount of driving you did relative to the amount of money you had put in the tank, or you'd end up stranded. Kelly learned this the hard way one evening. After a day filled with staff shortages and screaming children, she was heading through Six Corners toward home when the car sputtered to a stop. Both snow and darkness were falling fast, but there was a gas station just two miles up the road. Kelly called her daughter to say she'd be home late. Then she fished a plastic container from the trunk, hunched her back against the cold and set out for the long walk by herself."

Here's what you need to know: • The Trump administration is ending protections for nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador who have been allowed to live and work in the U.S. since a pair of earthquakes struck their country in 2001. The Department of Homeland Security said that because El Salvador's infrastructure had been rebuilt, the Salvadorans no longer qualified for the Temporary Protected Status program. Tens of thousands of Haitians and Nicaraguans have also lost their protected status. • The immigrants face deportation by next year, at which point the U.S. could lose up to a million people, including so-called Dreamers, from its legal work force. We examine the choices before the nation's employers. • North Korea agreed today to send athletes to the Winter Olympics in South Korea next month, a symbolic breakthrough after months of escalating tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear program. The North not only shunned the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul but also tried to disrupt them after talks on co-hosting them fell apart. • The current negotiations, at a border village, could help gauge whether North Korea is willing to moderate its behavior after a year of nuclear and missile tests that have raised fears of war on the Korean Peninsula. • The special counsel, Robert Mueller, told President Trump's lawyers last month that he would probably seek to interview the president, two people familiar with the discussion said. No formal request has been made, and no date has been set. The White House has pledged full cooperation in the investigation into whether the Trump campaign worked with Russian operatives to try to influence the election. Separately, we profiled the former journalist whose firm compiled the notorious dossier about possible links between Mr. Trump and Russia. • And the book that has Washington buzzing is ""altogether fitting, if ultimately, unsatisfying,"" one of our political correspondents writes. Read his review of ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House."" • Oprah Winfrey's rousing speech at the Golden Globe Awards had some Democrats dreaming that she would run for president. Others were skeptical about her prospects. ""We have to show what we stand for,"" one Democratic strategist said. ""Other than 'we all get a car,' what will an Oprah presidency look like?"" • Ms. Winfrey has said she has no  political ambitions. But politicians could learn from her address on Sunday, our chief TV critic writes. (Read her speech here.) • Supporters of the new tax law say it will help American multinationals compete more aggressively overseas. Others see incentives to put factories overseas. • A growing number of experts, including some Federal Reserve officials, say it's time for a new approach to managing the economy. • Apple has been asked by two major investors to study the health effects of its devices and to offer parents more tools to limit children's screen time. • H&M apologized for an image on its online store showing a black child in a sweatshirt that said ""coolest monkey in the jungle."" The item will no longer be sold. • U.S. stocks were mixed on Monday. Here's a snapshot of global markets today. Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • Want to get organized? Try a paper planner instead of apps. • What is holding you back? • Recipe of the day: Make a loaf of zucchini bread for yourself, and another to share. • Partisan writing you shouldn't miss Writers from across the political spectrum discuss questions about President Trump's mental state. • Another title for Alabama The Crimson Tide won its fifth college football championship in nine years, coming from behind to beat the Georgia Bulldogs in overtime, 26-23. Our reporters analyzed key moments from the game, which President Trump attended. • Charges dismissed in ranch standoff Citing the government's missteps in withholding evidence, a Las Vegas judge  dismissed charges against Cliven Bundy and his sons over their armed confrontation with federal agents at their Nevada ranch in 2014. • Brain surgery in 3-D New videomicroscopes are giving surgeons at a Manhattan hospital ""Superman eyes,"" making delicate operations easier to navigate. • A one-of-a-kind job More than 13,000 people applied to visit every destination on our Travel section's annual list of 52 Places to Go.

(We'll announce the winner and the list of destinations this week.) • Readers respond to coverage of Mormon leader Hundreds wrote to say that our recent obituary for Thomas Monson, the president of the Mormon Church, focused too narrowly on politics and controversy and overlooked his contributions to the community. Our obituaries editor addressed their concerns. • Best of late-night TV Several hosts addressed Oprah Winfrey's appearance at the Golden Globes: ""People were immediately calling that speech presidential,"" Stephen Colbert said. ""And a year ago, I would have agreed."" • Quotation of the day ""It's sort of an America-last tax policy. We are basically saying that if you earn in the U.S., you pay X, and if you earn abroad, you pay X divided by two."" — Kimberly Clausing, an economist, describing how the new federal tax law could actually make it attractive for American multinational companies to put more assembly lines on foreign soil. Welcome to the year of purple. The Pantone Color Institute, which helps manufacturers select colors for designs, has been naming a color of the year since 2000 (It chose Greenery last year, and Rose Quartz — think millennial pink — shared the title with Serenity blue in 2016). This year the shade is Ultra Violet. ""We wanted to pick something that brings hope and an uplifting message,"" the institute's director, Leatrice Eiseman, told The Times. In Phoenician times, purple dye was made from the mucus of sea snails in the coastal city of Tyre, in what is now Lebanon. Because the color was difficult and expensive to produce, it became associated with power and royalty, from ancient Rome to the kingdoms of Europe. In the 1500s, Queen Elizabeth I decreed that only members of the royal family could wear the color. In 1856, a British chemist, William Henry Perkin, made the color more accessible when he accidentally created a purple dye while trying to concoct a treatment for malaria. More than 160 years later, a color that's rare in nature is about to have its moment. For more on the color purple, read on.

Op-Ed,2018-01-09,"Gail: Happy 2018, Bret. What’s been your top minute so far? I’m tempted by the president’s announcement that he was not only a genius but “a very stable genius at that.” Yet I’m still sort of fixated on the my-nuclear-button-is-bigger-than-yours tweet.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/opinion/stable-genius-white-house.html,1510," Gail: Happy 2018, Bret. What's been your top minute so far? I'm tempted by the president's announcement that he was not only a genius but ""a very stable genius at that."" Yet I'm still sort of fixated on the my-nuclear-button-is-bigger-than-yours tweet. Bret: Donald Trump's boasting about his ""genius"" reminds me of the old saying: ""Being powerful is like being a lady. If you have to tell people you are, you aren't."" I think we can safely adapt that quip to the subject of being smart. Then again, we can survive an intellectually deficient president. What should really worry us is someone who talks about nuclear weapons the way bratty 6-year-old boys might talk about their Tonka trucks. This is dangerous. It shows he's flippant about the one thing no president can afford to be unserious about. 25th Amendment, hello? Gail: Cynic though I may be, I did not expect to see our right-left conversation morph into a discussion about how the president could be removed from office for mental incapacity. But here we are. It's pretty clear it would be almost impossible to really make that happen, unless Trump starts swinging from the chandelier and throwing rocks at White House tour groups. Bret: I'm not sure that would make much of a difference. Paul Ryan might say it's all about this president's ""unique style"" and Sean Hannity would note that Trump's rocks hit only the liberals in the tour groups. But please continue. Gail: You'd need huge majorities in the House and Senate, plus a cabinet uprising to do the deed, and with Trump's crew they're just as likely to declare him emperor. There was a moment during a congressional hearing when someone asked Ben Carson whether he had been briefed on what his responsibilities would be under the 25th Amendment, and Carson said something along the lines of ""um … no."" God, suddenly I'm imagining Linda McMahon, who's head of the Small Business Administration, giving her colleagues a pep talk on what she learned when she was running that wrestling league …. Bret: You've put your finger on what disturbs me most. We are counting on Trump's cabinet to be the adults in the room, the people who set the boss straight and make sure the Twitter side of his brain doesn't translate into policy or action. But instead of serving as restraints they've become enablers, publicly attesting to Trump's fitness even as they savage him in private as a ""dope"" or ""moron."" Or so we are learning from Michael Wolff's ""Fire and Fury."" I can't remember when a book has ever had quite such an immediate impact on a presidency as this one. Do you think it will do lasting damage to Trump? Or does he shrug this off just like every other previous bombshell? Gail: He's pretty much capable of shrugging off anything in a day or two — remember the attention span issue. The question is whether it's going to mobilize the people who could do something. I'm not seeing Republicans in Congress standing up and saying, ""Look, this cannot continue."" I'd like to see good old Lindsey Graham worrying more about this and less about anti-Trump prejudice in the F.B.I. By the way, according to the book, Trump called me a ""moron"" after I wrote a column asking whether we'd be better off with Mike Pence. Bret: I'm kind of envious of that. He once called me a ""killer,"" but that was to my face, and I think he was trying to be ingratiating. Gail: It was interesting that a would-Pence-be-better column set him off. What proportion of the Republicans in Congress are having that exact same discussion on a regular basis? Bret: I'm not sure how much registers with congressional Republicans these days. They are officially in the business of making excuses and attacking the messenger. By the way, I'm afraid that in the case of Michael Wolff — whose journalistic ethics are, shall we say, of a distinctly creative variety — they'll have plenty to attack. Gail: Well, we're entering a big, big election year. I'm wondering how many Republican candidates are going to stop bragging about tax cuts for long enough to focus on the slightly more critical question of whether we have a mentally unstable person in the White House. What do you think? Bret: Fuhgeddaboudit. The number of Republican candidates who will expressly denounce Trump's behavior is probably less than zero. The only question is the ardor with which they'll express their admiration for and fealty to the president. Then again, one consequence of Wolff's book is that it has pretty much destroyed the political career of one Stephen K. Bannon. That might mean that the G.O.P.'s taste for nominating Roy Moore-like figures may abate, at least for a while. Mitch McConnell must be smiling. Gail: Yeah, in fact, tweeting a grin. Bret: All this being said, I continue to think that Democrats are gulling themselves if they think they can retake one or both houses of Congress merely on the strength of opposition to Trump. Constantly calling the president an idiot is another way of insulting everyone who voted for him and may do more to galvanize them come November than to persuade them to flip their vote. And Democrats will be even less persuasive to voters if the economy continues to perform well, or if middle-class voters see their taxes go down thanks to the tax bill. All of which means that Democrats have to develop a political slogan at least as effective as MAGA. I would humbly suggest MASA: Make America Sane Again. Gail: I can imagine Chuck Schumer having a flag made. But let me ask you a question about the economy. It's been doing very well ever since — ahem — Barack Obama resurrected it. It's been a good ride but people are beginning to question how long it'll last. I'm worried that any artificial heft the economy got from the tax cuts could just hasten the popping of our current balloon. Or, at minimum, make it harder for the government to deal with a recession crisis since there's less revenue coming in, even from the folks who can afford to send it. Bret: Morgan Stanley's Ruchir Sharma had an excellent Op-Ed essay in The Times the other day on the subject of economic forecasting. As he tells it, economic forecasters ""have not predicted a single United States recession since the Federal Reserve began keeping such records a half-century ago, and missed many revivals,"" including the worldwide resurgence in 2017. Which is only to say that the answer to your question about how long the recovery will last is, ¿Quién sabe? Gail: Bret, if we only conversed about things we had solid information about, we would have to spend all our time discussing yesterday's weather. Come on, take a jump. Bret: Let's say the recovery has some legs in it. For starters, it's coming on the heels of seven years of extremely sluggish growth, so the 3 percent growth figures we are seeing now are really a return to normal growth, not a sign of overheating. Also, the recovery is a global phenomenon, reaching from Japan to Europe. And continued growth likely means gradually higher interest rates, which would give the Fed some running room in the event of a recession or a crash. All of which makes me an economic optimist on balance. I think what we really have to worry about is somebody or other banging on that nuclear button. That, and, well, the degradation of our political culture as we begin to accept Trumpian behavior as the new normal. Gail: So to summarize our start of the new year, you are worried about the planet blowing up and the nation's political leadership becoming permanently attached to psycho-tweeting. While I am worried about those two things plus an economic nose-dive, I think our national prospects might improve a tiny bit if the Democrats win the House or Senate or both in November. But you think there's no hope whatsoever for change as long as he who must not be named is still commander in chief. Bret: I was touched and impressed by Nick Kristof's column on Sunday, which pointed out all the things that are going right in this world: ever fewer people living in extreme poverty, ever more people becoming literate and gaining access to electricity and clean water, and so on. It put some of our current political fixations into perspective. Then again, we'd be out of luck and probably out of work as columnists if all we had was good news and progress. So, in that spirit, thank you, President Trump! You're doing wonders for our business. Please keep the tweets, threats and general insanity coming in '18. Gail: On the other hand, how's the family? Bret: Wonderful, thanks. We've been watching your New York snowmageddon from comparatively balmy Germany. Also, you can drive as fast as you want on the autobahn. Ain't nothing like living in a free country."

So it was a surprise when he deftly seized on the Winter Olympics on Tuesday to turn toward diplomacy with Seoul, playing the part of the statesman even while seeking fractures in the seven-decade alliance between South Korea and the United States. After his outreach to Seoul on New Year's Day, Mr. Kim agreed to send a team to compete in the Olympics next month when the Winter Games open in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang. That was followed by an announcement about resumption of military-to-military talks between the two countries — without the United States. All this is a relief to South Korea's leader, President Moon Jae-in, who feared the North would find a way — missile launches, terrorism, a nuclear test — to cast a pall over a sports event meant to highlight the South's emergence as one of the world's most dynamic economies. Few in Seoul or Washington believe Mr. Kim, though an avid sports fan, is motivated solely by the Olympic spirit. The Winter Games also present him with an ideal opportunity to throw a wrench in President Trump's threats of military action if the North does not agree to give up its nuclear program. Along the way, Mr. Kim is looking to get some relief from sanctions that are beginning to bite, and to bring China back to its traditional position — that no one should disturb the status quo, even if that means tolerating a North Korea armed with nuclear weapons. ""This was a very smart move and underscores how we are in a longstanding habit of underestimating the North,"" said Nicholas Eberstadt, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute who has spent decades studying North Korea. ""If they can punch a hole through the maximum-pressure coalition and it starts to leak, it gives them more room and more time to achieve their objective, which is all about the nuclear program."" It is a strategy meant to resonate with many South Korean progressives who argue that defusing tensions on the peninsula has to be Seoul's top priority. And it pointedly excluded the United States, although South Korea insists it will keep the United States in the loop. By leaving bombast out of his speech last week and even appearing before the cameras in a Western-style suit and tie, Mr. Kim clearly wants to be seen as a statesman. Mr. Trump, who has promised to ""totally destroy"" the North if it puts the United States at risk, has already claimed credit for the new tone. The latest United Nations Security Council sanctions, issued last month, were intended to threaten the North's energy supplies and its opportunities to earn hard currency, possibly derailing the North's surprising economic growth. What Mr. Kim is not discussing with the South is the future of his nuclear weapons and missile programs. Many experts fear that is exactly the point: Relief from tightening sanctions or threat of American attack may gave his engineers time to perfect a warhead able to hit the continental United States. The evidence of that came on Tuesday when Ri Son-kwon, the chief North Korean delegate to the talks, protested when South Korea called for the resumption of denuclearization discussions, according to pool reports. And none are scheduled. To drive home the point Mr. Ri said, according to the same reports, ""Our cutting-edge weapons, including our hydrogen bomb and intercontinental ballistic missiles, are not targeting our Korean brothers, China or Russia, but the United States."" Mr. Kim has made no secret of his determination to keep his nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. In his New Year's speech, he described his country's atomic arsenal as the only thing preventing the United States from starting a war on the Korean Peninsula, boasting of the ""nuclear button"" on his desk. That led to Mr. Trump's retort that he has ""a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!"" The mine-is-bigger exchange obscured two more important elements of the speech. Mr. Kim told his people to brace themselves for the effects of sanctions, which have led to fuel shortages and significantly higher prices. It was a rare admission that Mr. Trump's campaign was getting to Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim also urged the South to break ranks with Washington on the issue of sanctions and begin talks about the Olympics. Mr. Moon has been worried about a North Korean disruption of the Winter Games, and his staff members told American officials that South Korea wanted to suspend military exercises with the United States during the Olympics and find a role for the North, which won seven medals in the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro. Senior American officials said they had no choice but to accede to Mr. Moon's appeals. Mr. Trump agreed in a Jan. 4 phone call with Mr. Moon to suspend the military exercises, and said at Camp David over the weekend that ""I'd like to see them getting involved in the Olympics and maybe things go from there."" The Games end in late February. In Washington, it is widely believed that no military action would happen until afterward, in the event that diplomatic routes fail. The Pentagon has drawn up extensive plans, including a punch-in-the-nose strategy against the North that would involve taking out a missile, and a much broader attack on the missile and nuclear sites. But both Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson have argued internally that it would be nearly impossible to contain any retaliation, officials have said. The State Department welcomed Tuesday's talks at the Demilitarized Zone, but Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said South Korean officials ""will ensure North Korean participation in the Winter Olympics does not violate the sanctions."" Both the North and South have engaged in this dance before. Twenty-six years ago, just as the Soviet Union was disappearing, the countries signed a treaty of reconciliation and nonaggression that promised to formally bring an end to the Korean War, keep the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons and re-establish telephone lines, mail and economic exchanges. Most of that agreement has never been realized. But if Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon were to move to re-establishing diplomacy without clear steps by the North toward denuclearization, they would greatly complicate Mr. Trump's military threat and could well undermine the international effort to get China to further tighten sanctions against Pyongyang. ""It gives the Chinese government the chance to do what it wishes to do: Pull back on the pressure that the Americans are intent on building,"" Mr. Eberstadt noted. Any provocation from the North, especially another intercontinental missile test or an atmospheric test of a nuclear weapon, could change that dynamic. And that would work to the advantage of the United States, which knows that testing is critical to Mr. Kim's ambition to prove, beyond doubt, that he can target American cities. The core of the debate in Seoul is whether Mr. Kim's overture is a tactical move, or represents an entirely new strategy. ""His peace offensive is leading to the first steps in a transition from confrontation and rising tensions to easing tensions and peace on the peninsula,"" said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. But if his intent was to divide the South from the United States, Mr. Kim has his moment. South Korea's ethnic nationalism has always been a major factor in its politics; in the late 1980s, there were more protests against the United States' military presence in the South than against the North's threats. And for those South Koreans longing for a thaw after months of tensions, Mr. Kim could hardly have chosen a better way than through sports. Despite the Koreas' longstanding enmity, South Koreans often cheer for the North's athletes in international competition. As early as 1964, the two Koreas discussed fielding a joint Olympic team, an idea that has never worked but has resurfaced over the decades. In 2000, however — the year the two Koreas held their first summit meeting — athletes from both countries marched together at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics. They did so again at the Athens Games in 2004, carrying a blue and white flag representing a unified Korea. Their athletes last marched together at the Asian Winter Games in Changchun, China, in 2007. ""I want to see the same glory again,""  President Moon said in June, suggesting that the two nations march together in Pyeongchang. On Tuesday, South Korean officials said the two sides were close to agreeing that they would do so."
News,2018-01-09,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to attend the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, in the coming weeks, an administration official said on Tuesday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/trump-davos-world-economic-forum.html,898," WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to attend the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, in the coming weeks, an administration official said on Tuesday. In a statement, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the president was looking forward to attending the gathering of world leaders and business executives. ""The president welcomes opportunities to advance his America First agenda with world leaders,"" Ms. Sanders said. ""At this year's World Economic Forum, the president looks forward to promoting his policies to strengthen American businesses, American industries and American workers."" Mr. Trump's planned appearance at an event that is synonymous with wealth and elite prestige comes as he enters the second year of a term he won on a message of economic populism. Presidents have rarely attended the forum in Davos, in part out of a concern that it would send the wrong message to be rubbing shoulders with some of the world's richest individuals. Mr. Trump won the 2016 election in part by attacking elites in the United States and promising to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington of lobbyists, corporate influence and members of the establishment — the very description of those who regularly attend the Davos forum. The event in Switzerland is a global symbol of everything that Mr. Trump's former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, railed against during the presidential campaign and the first seven months in the administration. But Mr. Trump has also spent a lifetime as a real estate mogul and television personality seeking to be accepted by the financial and media elite in New York and around the world. His decision to travel to Davos as president may represent his desire to prove that he has achieved that goal. Some of Mr. Trump's advisers were befuddled by his planned trip, coming a year after his team decided not to send a representative to the 2017 gathering. A year into his term, Mr. Trump's appearance at the forum is certain to highlight the clash between his America First agenda and the more globalist approach of some of America's closest allies around the world. Those disagreements have been highlighted during Mr. Trump's earlier trips abroad, including arguments with European leaders about the need for action to confront climate change. Mr. Trump's visit to Asia last year underscored his disagreements on trade issues with countries in the region. Many of the participants at Davos are sure to embrace the globalist views that Mr. Trump has rejected, providing the potential for dramatic disagreements between the president and others at the meeting. But the event — which often focuses on global economic issues — also will provide Mr. Trump with a platform to boast about the improving American economy, including the rise in the stock market and the low jobless rate. The president has eagerly claimed credit for the economic improvements during his first year in office, and has predicted that the tax overhaul passed at the end of last year would accelerate those trends. The annual economic forum takes place in the resort town of Davos high in the Swiss Alps, bringing together more than 3,000 members of the global elite in what has been described as the world's most high-powered networking event. Those who attend include journalists and columnists, Hollywood celebrities, researchers, corporate chief executive officers and other business titans, and some heads of state. Former President Bill Clinton attended the forum in 2000 and former president George W. Bush attended a meeting of the Word Economic Forum in Egypt in 2008. But former President Barack Obama did not attend the meetings during the time he was in the White House. Founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a German economics professor, the forum has become an annual meeting that includes dinners and over 400 panel discussion sessions, largely about world social and economic trends. Officially, it is an academic conference; unofficially it is a global schmoozefest for the rich and powerful. The conference is still dominated by corporate executives, but the gathering also now attracts world leaders, some of whom use the venue as a way to hold less formal bilateral conversations. Last year, President Xi Jinping of China attended the forum, which began just days before Mr. Trump's inauguration, becoming the first Chinese leader to mingle with the corporate and media crowd in the mountain village. In a speech at the forum, Mr. Xi portrayed his country as a global leader interested in free trade at a time that Mr. Trump was already calling for a turn inward. Mr. Xi challenged the incoming president not to forsake trade with the rest of the world. ""Pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room,"" Mr. Xi said in Davos last year. ""While wind and rain may be kept outside, that dark room will also block light and air. No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war."" The forum has also become a way to be seen with the growing number of global celebrities; last year, it was attended by Matt Damon and Forest Whitaker, the actors, and the singer Shakira. Officials with the World Economic Forum, which takes place from January 23 to 26, said they did not know what dates to expect the president to attend. The White House did not say when Mr. Trump would travel there, or say whether he would make other stops on a broader overseas trips."
