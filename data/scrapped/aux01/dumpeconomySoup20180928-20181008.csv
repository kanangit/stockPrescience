News,2018-09-28,"With awards season approaching, stylists are at fashion weeks, scoping out looks for their clients, readying them to be at their best for months of parading down scads of red carpets. Harvey Weinstein may be banished, but the awards campaign machine he helped create grinds on. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/style/red-carpet-fashion-business-awards-season.html,937," With awards season approaching, stylists are at fashion weeks, scoping out looks for their clients, readying them to be at their best for months of parading down scads of red carpets. Harvey Weinstein may be banished, but the awards campaign machine he helped create grinds on.  Now, a year into #MeToo, and after the emboldened feminist statements made by actresses at the last Golden Globes and in Cannes, has the marketing machinery of the red carpet changed at all? The early answer is no. With an asterisk. The red carpet, of course, has a not-so-secret double life as a klieg-lighted walking advertisement for lavish brands. Many actresses and actors on the carpet get paid to wear gowns, watches and jewels, and can pocket anywhere from an estimated $5,000 to more than $100,000 for their efforts. In the last year, though, the specter was raised, fleetingly, that substance may trump conspicuous consumption in red carpet form. At the Globes in January, A-list women, sheathed in black, seemed less like fashion police fodder than an indomitable army, marching as one under the banner of Times Up, the anti-harassment campaign they had just introduced.  The show of solidarity was echoed a few months later on the red carpet at Cannes, when 82 women linked arms to protest the dearth of women filmmakers the festival had showcased over the years. But recent high-profile red carpets at the Venice and Toronto film festivals and at the Emmys felt like a return to the same old, with actresses swathed in such familiar couture names as Armani Privé, Valentino and Givenchy. At the Emmys, Dakota Fanning was resplendent in a green Dior gown and plum-size emeralds, reportedly weighing 175 carats, from Lorraine Schwartz. For a few red carpet watchers, the ostentation was at odds with the somber messaging behind #MeToo's cri de coeur, but hardly a surprise. Even at the empowered Golden Globes, actors and actresses accessorized with, by one count, more than $20 million worth of wares from the likes of Harry Winston, Bulgari and Chopard.  Though some lucre from the endorsements was diverted to Time's Up — Tiffany & Co. pledged on behalf of everyone wearing its brand, and Forevermark donated $25,000 on behalf of Shailene Woodley — some critics still found the branding exercise in poor taste. ""The whole seriousness of #MeToo — and certainly Ask Her More — is somewhat compromised by these women trooping out in jewels which often match their movie salaries,"" said Bronwyn Cosgrave, a fashion historian who has contributed to red carpet coverage by The New York Times. ""But it's too much of a booming economy to have #MeToo jeopardize it."" Several Hollywood stylists noted that there had been a shift on the red carpet since #MeToo. Their female clients felt more like a tribe, they said, united in common cause. More people were requesting female collaborators and minority designers. And they said that women should not have to account for or defend their sartorial choices, whether or not they're paid to make them. ""The relationships between designers and actresses is more like a happy marriage and less like an arranged one,"" said Erica Cloud, who has styled Mandy Moore, Lake Bell and Sophia Bush, in an email. The sentiment was echoed by Leith Clark, who is Keira Knightley's personal stylist as well as style director-at-large for Harper's Bazaar UK. ""I don't think anything an actor chooses to wear counters Me Too,"" Ms. Clark wrote in a text message. ""It's their choice. I don't think this movement is in any way about setting further rules or restrictions for women."" As for the money stream from endorsement deals, Arianne Phillips, the costume designer and longtime stylist to Madonna, said that celebrities aligned with various charities or causes should trumpet them, and donate the money accordingly. ""We can use that revenue stream in positive ways,"" Ms. Phillips said. ""It's a missed opportunity not to."" While the marketing machine marches on, some insiders said that the red carpet has seen a tonal shift. Four years ago, interviewers were urged to ask actresses about more than their dresses. These days, not asking about sexual harassment or gender equity is the rarity rather than the norm. Perhaps unsurprisingly, several stylists saw nothing wrong with asking someone about who designed her dress, so long as the queries did not end there — especially since, as Ms. Clark said, ""clothes can serve as armor, and a vessel of strength, confidence and grace.""  Ms. Cloud said that designers like Christian Siriano, who dresses women of all sizes, ages and ethnicities, should be celebrated and, she added, ""become the norm."" And Karla Welch, whose clients include Olivia Wilde, Sarah Paulson, Elisabeth Moss and Tracee Ellis Ross, said it was misguided to look to the carpet or symbolic actions taken there, like wearing black en masse, as be-all-and-end-all measures of progress made in the name of #MeToo. The structural inequities in Hollywood have nothing to do with what people happened to put on for a premiere or an awards show, Ms. Welch said. ""It's about your contract, negotiating for an inclusion rider, making sure the female star gets paid as much as the male star, making sure that executives and all the studios give more,"" she said. ""That's where the work is done. The red carpet is the last thing about it."" A question that still hangs about is whether people will ever again opt to put their clients in Marchesa, the label run by Georgina Chapman, Harvey Weinstein's former wife. Ms. Welch said that while she would not rule out the possibility, the question annoyed her nonetheless. ""It's another example of blaming a woman,"" she said. ""Again the woman is suffering for the toxicity of the man."""
Op-Ed,2018-09-28,"ATHENS — In his declared intention to “Make America Great Again,” President Trump appears set on destroying the foundations of American greatness. The multinational organizations and agreements that established peace and stability, and encouraged economic growth for some seven decades, were designed principally by Americans. They organized the world pretty much the way that suited them, and they reaped the benefits of dominating it through a complex network of organizations and treaties. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/opinion/konstandaras-ancient-athens-trump.html,1041," ATHENS — In his declared intention to ""Make America Great Again,"" President Trump appears set on destroying the foundations of American greatness. The multinational organizations and agreements that established peace and stability, and encouraged economic growth for some seven decades, were designed principally by Americans. They organized the world pretty much the way that suited them, and they reaped the benefits of dominating it through a complex network of organizations and treaties.  On a global scale, this post-World War II American hegemony echoed the way that ancient Athens, after leading a victorious alliance of Greek city-states against a Persian invasion, gradually shaped the alliance into an empire. The Athenians of the fifth century B.C.E. took charge of the Greek states' defense, controlled their diplomatic and trade relations, and intervened in their politics. An enigmatic figure from that time known only as the Old Oligarch, because of his blunt critique of democratic Athens, was very clear in his writing about what he did not like about the city's Constitution and its citizens' behavior. Unlike Mr. Trump, however, he understood that the Athenians had gained much by rigging the Greek world in their favor. ""I do not think well of their Constitution,"" he wrote. ""But since they have decided to have it so, I intend to point out how well they preserve it and how they accomplish those other things for which the rest of the Greeks criticize them. One must forgive everyone for looking after their own interests."" In democracy, the Old Oligarch declared, the worst citizens had an equal say and could even be elected to office, at the expense of the city's finest. Furthermore, as the economy boomed through the links of empire, some slaves and foreign residents had even become rich in trade and commerce. Slaves didn't know their place, the Oligarch complained. You could not even beat them in the street. They dressed the way their masters did, and it was impossible to tell them apart. The Athenians, he charged, bullied their allies, turning a defense agreement into an empire in whose center they sat, pulling all the strings. They drew tribute from their allies; they supported democrats against the best citizens to fit Athenian interests.  ""For like is well-disposed to like. Accordingly, the Athenians prefer those sympathetic to themselves,"" the Old Oligarch noted.  With their powerful navy, the Athenians controlled their allies' dealings, from politics to trade. They made their partners use Athenian currency, weights and measures. They obliged the allies to bring their legal issues to Athenian courts, where litigants had to win the favor of Athenian citizens who sat in judgment of them.  ""In this way, the allies have become the slaves of the Athenian people,"" the Old Oligarch charged. Scholars are uncertain of the date of the ""Old Oligarch"" text (originally attributed mistakenly to Xenophon of Athens). It may have been written before 431 B.C.E., when war broke out between Athens and Sparta, and certainly before 404, when the victorious Spartans imposed an oligarchy on Athens, tore down its walls and dismantled its alliance. (Less than a year later, after brutal oligarchic rule and civil strife had made the city ungovernable, the Spartans accepted a return to democracy in Athens.) One year into the war with Sparta, in the prime of his city's democracy and power, Pericles, the great Athenian leader, also expressed a composite view of his state's policies: ""In nobility of spirit, we stand in sharp contrast to most men; for it is not by receiving kindness, but by conferring it, that we acquire our friends,"" the historian Thucydides quoted him as saying at a funeral of war dead.  But Pericles was no softhearted liberal in the modern sense. His pursuit was Athenian greatness — and domestic and foreign policy contributed to this. Before succumbing to a plague that struck Athens during the war, he tried to encourage his fellow citizens.  ""It will be remembered forever, how we of all Greeks held sway over the greatest number of Greeks, how in the greatest wars we held out against our foes whether united or single, and inhabited a city that was the richest in all things and the greatest,"" he declared. Both the grudging respect of a political opponent of democracy and the inspired rhetoric of its champion reveal that Athens had created a network of common interests among its citizens and with its allies, all of which it was able to manipulate to its own advantage. Allied tribute helped fund the glorious temples whose ruins still grace the Greek capital; allied money and ships contributed to Athens's naval might, which, in turn, helped the Athenians dominate their allies. In Thucydides's analysis, it was this rise in influence that provoked Sparta to reassert its authority as the Greeks' greatest power. After Pericles's death, arrogance toward other states and recklessness contributed to Athens's defeat. The Oligarch was given his catchy name a century ago by a prominent classicist, Gilbert Murray, at a time when the word was not synonymous with friends of Vladimir Putin or billionaires funding political campaigns. The name reflected the perennial tension in Athens and other city-states between the rule of the many and the rule of the few. Unlike those who today try to manipulate politics to their ends, the Old Oligarch could appreciate the effectiveness of what he did not like. He knew that the common people had to have economic benefits and a say in the running of the state, because the state depended on them.  ""The people generally are right to have more than the highborn and the wealthy, because it is the people who man the ships and impart strength to the city,"" he wrote. Today, as President Trump tries to roll back health care for a large part of the population, as he invests in domestic division and further economic inequality, as he undermines alliances and the international order, he seems blind to the value of what he does not like, indifferent to the consequences of his actions. Endowed with the immense powers of his office, he lacks the cynical Old Oligarch's understanding of politics. Unlike Pericles, he does not see that power can be enhanced through the projection of kindness. Nikos Konstandaras is a columnist at the Greek newspaper Kathimerini.

The story starts off with the fraught, to say the least, relationship between a Barbadian nanny, Britney, and her former white employers, Brooke and Jay. There are laughs, which become increasingly uncomfortable as … Let's just say that the turns of events won't surprise anyone familiar with this filmmaker, who, since his breakthrough in 1995 with ""Welcome to the Dollhouse,"" has become an unflinching chronicler of suburban America, warts and all — but really, mostly warts. As the New York Times critic A. O. Scott noted in his review of ""Wiener-Dog"" (2016), ""We don't turn to Mr. Solondz for warm affirmations of human decency."" Yet there is something different about ""Emma and Max."" This time, he is bringing his nonjudgmental eye, matter-of-fact dark humor and unerring knack to get under an audience's skin to the stage, where he's making his playwriting debut. ""I had an idea of something I thought could work as a play and not a movie — I don't even know if I can explain how and why, it just felt like a play,"" Mr. Solondz, 58, said in an interview. ""And I thought it would be a kind of adventure, see what kinds of doors it would open, what kind of experiences it might provide."" He reached out to the playwright Thomas Bradshaw, whose own provocative shows, including ""Burning"" and ""Intimacy,"" have elicited both praise and outrage. The two have been friends since 2011, when they participated in a public conversation fittingly titled ""Talking Taboos."" Mr. Bradshaw, a member of the Flea Theater's artistic advisory group, passed the play along to the theater's artistic director, Niegel Smith, and its producing director, Carol Ostrow. They responded positively and set up a couple of table readings. At one, ""some actors pointed out that he's somehow zeroed in on this black experience of loving whiteness, and that's something the culture hasn't talked about in any major ways,"" Mr. Smith said. ""I just thought, 'Wow, this is incendiary.'"" And now, about a year and a half after the script went out, ""Emma and Max"" is having its first preview, on Oct. 1, with Mr. Solondz also at the helm. ""I realized I should just do it myself,"" he said. ""After all, I write and direct my own movies, so why shouldn't I write and direct my own play?"" (Intriguingly, Mr. Solondz portrayed a struggling downtown playwright in his 1989 debut feature, ""Fear, Anxiety & Depression""; the film tanked, after which its author waited six years for a follow-up.) He threw himself into the new project, from the audition process to the creation of the video projections and even the selection of the Barbadian artist Sheena Rose for the show's poster. Throughout, Mr. Solondz was in the peculiar position of being a beginner with considerable experience. It helped that he gradually found helpful equivalencies between his old and new worlds. ""Just as in filmmaking, the camera person is the first hire, the most critical initial hire in theater for me was the set designer,"" Mr. Solondz said, referring to Julia Noulin-Mérat. ""I quickly figured out during the prep period that I needed someone who could help me figure out how to contain this."" Working with the actors came naturally. Zonya Love, who plays Britney, recalled that during rehearsal Mr. Solondz would get scenes started by saying, ""Action,"" and end them with ""Cut."" Ms. Love, 37, bears much of the show's emotional burden, which at times feels like a literal one. ""One of the things I have to do after we rehearse is stretch my back because the weight of who she is pulled me down,"" she said in a telephone interview. Like much of Mr. Solondz's work, ""Emma and Max"" (named after Brooke and Jay's children, who appear in the show only as projections) tiptoes between pathos and satire, between tragedy and the banality of urban life — sprinkled with his acidic humor. During casting, he was particularly receptive to actors who were naturally funny, but when working with them later, he ensured that they did not actively set out to draw laughs. ""Most of my career, I've been asked to do comedy, and it's wonderful, but Todd doesn't want my bag of tricks,"" said Ilana Becker, who plays Brooke, by telephone. ""He said, 'I don't want Neil Simon, I want Fassbinder.' "" Understatement, even a certain detachment have always been key to Mr. Solondz, and they may be the best ways to make the hot-button material he often deals with palatable. ""There is a directness and economy of storytelling that's always present in his work,"" Mr. Bradshaw said in an email. ""He's also quite interested in juxtaposing the public faces of his characters and the turmoil of their inner lives."" That difference is what is fascinating about the enigmatic Britney, a worthy addition to Mr. Solondz's gallery of complicated misfits, outsiders and so-called losers — characters who challenge an audience's expectations of who, and what, deserves sympathy. ""Smugness is lethal,"" said the affable Mr. Solondz (who, in the show, makes the entitled parents the targets of his most pointed satire). ""When I go to a movie, I do want to be provoked. Not in a sensationalistic way, but in the sense that you become more connected to the world. The movies and plays that touch me the most remind me and reassure me of perhaps the illusion that I am not alone."" ""I'm not looking for people to argue about my stuff,"" he added. ""Frankly, some people are of the mind that it's important to have people hate you, that it means you've done something important."" He laughed. ""But I prefer people don't hate me, O.K.?"""
News,2018-09-28,"Aimee Raupp-Temple and her husband, Ken Temple, rented instead of buying a house when they first moved from Brooklyn Heights to Westport, Conn., three years ago, because they weren’t sure they were ready to fully commit to the suburbs.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/realestate/rent-vs-buy-suburban-edition.html,1928," Aimee Raupp-Temple and her husband, Ken Temple, rented instead of buying a house when they first moved from Brooklyn Heights to Westport, Conn., three years ago, because they weren't sure they were ready to fully commit to the suburbs. ""It was a big move — neither of us had ever lived in Connecticut,"" said Ms. Raupp-Temple, 43, an author and acupuncturist.  Renting, it turned out, gave them time to figure out that they loved Westport. And yet, when their lease was up earlier this year, they decided to rent again.  Mr. Temple, 46, works in finance, and he was convinced that home prices, already dropping, would continue to decline. ""Our parents' mentality was, you bought your home and that was your major profit place. Now, I think people are a little more cautious,"" Ms. Raupp-Temple said.  In a real estate market tinged with so much uncertainty, renting at more than $5,000, $8,000 or even $10,000 a month feels like a safer bet these days to a number of people who could well afford to buy in the suburban counties of Fairfield and Westchester, where median sale prices in many towns are above $1 million. Indeed, demand for high-end single-family rentals is up significantly, a trend that dovetails with a decline in sales in New York and across portions of the region.  Many would-be buyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude toward a market softened by uncertainty over the new federal tax law and general uneasiness about the economy, even as mortgage interest rates continue to rise. They are less concerned about shelling out so much money for monthly rent than about making a costly purchase they may later regret. When the Temples and their young son first moved to Westport, they rented a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom home for just under $5,000 a month. The rent was no small sum, but in the city they had been paying more for less: $6,500 for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. Now they are waiting out the market in a rambling older home just over the border in Wilton, at $5,100 a month.  ""There are so many other ways to invest and make money than real estate now,"" Ms. Raupp-Temple said.  In Fairfield County, the volume of single-family rentals was up 13 percent in July compared to a year ago, according to data from the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. In Westchester County, it was up 9.6 percent.  Growth in single-family home rentals over the past few years has been most significant at the high end, agents said. The second-quarter market report from William Pitt/Julia B. Fee Sotheby's International Realty cited ""an exploding rental market"" among high-end properties in the southern part of Fairfield County, in particular.  Data provided by the firm showed that for the first half of 2018, the number of homes that rented for $5,000 or more a month in the county as a whole was up 33 percent, to 268, compared to 2015. That included 61 properties that rented for $10,000 or more, a 35 percent increase over 2015. In pricey towns like Greenwich, New Canaan, Darien and Westport, homes at the lower end of that rental range tend to be older properties with three or four bedrooms and a decent-size yard. Those going for closer to $10,000 usually have at least five bedrooms, mint-condition amenities and large lots or a beach-area location. Westchester also showed growth in high-end rentals, but at a slower pace of just over 12 percent, and almost exclusively in the southern end of the county.  ""I definitely see an increase in interest in rentals in the Bronxville area,"" said Kathleen Collins, an agent with William Pitt. The cost to rent a home in the affluent square-mile village typically runs between $10,000 and $16,000 a month. Nevertheless, Ms. Collins said she had been approached by more agents than usual this year asking whether properties she had listed for sale might instead be available to rent. In at least two cases where agents negotiated rental agreements with Ms. Collins, the clients were seeking rentals because they were relocating from abroad.  To meet this growing demand, more high-end sellers seem to be willing to rent, especially if they can't get the sale price they want. The number of homes offered for rent at $5,000 and up in Fairfield County during the first half of the year was 25 percent higher than five years ago, according to data from William Pitt. In Westchester, inventory was up 18 percent. Homeowners are opting to rent their homes out not just to wait for a stronger market, but also as a way to cut potential losses, said Jaime Sneddon, an associate broker with the New Canaan, Conn., office of William Pitt.  If a homeowner sells a primary residence for less than it was bought for, the loss does not qualify for a tax deduction. But if the homeowner rents the house for at least two years, it can be legally converted to an investment property for tax purposes, and any capital loss when it is sold can be written off against future income. ""Not everybody can afford to do that, but many of my clients have done it this year,"" Mr. Sneddon said. The growing demand for single-family rentals is sparked in part by concern about the financial impact of the new federal tax law, which caps income-tax deductions for property, state and local taxes at $10,000, said Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel. Further fueling anxiety, he said, are the effect of rising interest rates and the ""unclear economic policy"" coming out of Washington.  ""We're going through this era of uncertainty,"" Mr. Miller said. ""And what do buyers do when the near-term seems uncertain? They pause."" In towns where prices have been falling over the past year, there is simply no sense of urgency among affluent buyers, agents said. In New Canaan, for example, where the median sale price is around $1.5 million, property values have declined by 10 to 12 percent over the last 12 months, Mr. Sneddon said. At the same time, the number of sales for the year-to-date is off by about 15 percent.  ""People are just nervous that values will continue to decline, and for that reason, more people are opting to rent, if they are not forced to buy,"" he said.  The suburban rental market has always appealed to people moving to the area for a change of employment, but a hesitancy to buy seems more pronounced in the current uncertain market, with renters hedging their bets in case it turns out they don't stay in their jobs, said Helen R. Cusa, an agent with Halstead. She recently helped a family moving from Los Angeles rent a four-bedroom home, at $10,500 a month, in the Saugatuck section of Westport. Availability of rentals has been higher than usual this year in Westport because of an excess of homes for sale above $2.5 million, she said. Michelle and Jeremy Fine signed a two-year lease in March for a five-bedroom house in the Old Hill section of Westport. The couple, who have two children, ages five and three, had been living in a rented condo in White Plains, and considered buying there, but decided against it. ""The property taxes there are just astronomical,"" said Ms. Fine, 41, who helps out with her husband's education business, ConnectPrep. ""The change in the federal tax law was definitely a factor for us."" Like the Temples, they didn't want to buy in Westport until they had tried it out. ""I don't believe you're spending that much more on rent than you would on a mortgage,"" Ms. Fine said. ""Being in a home you purchased that is not the right fit is a bigger challenge if you have to sell. You have to weigh out what's more important."" Renting a house also gives longtime apartment dwellers time to figure out what they really want in single-family living. Since moving to Wilton, Ms. Raupp-Temple said, she has concluded that an older home is not for her — too much upkeep.  ""And I'm also getting a sense of how much space we need,"" she said. ""I think we would be fine with three bedrooms, two baths. You start to realize what your needs really are."" Insecurity about the market is also turning more sellers into renters, at least in the short term. Todd David Miller, a vice president of sales at the Higgins Group, said that of the $57 million in sales his team has done so far this year, primarily in the towns of Westport and Fairfield, almost all of the sellers have either moved out of state or are renting in the area. Those who are staying in the area are gravitating toward home rentals near the beach. ""These are mainly higher-end transactions, and the majority of them had to sell at a loss,"" Mr. Miller said. ""They don't want to put any more money into real estate right now.""  Leslie Razook, an agent with William Pitt, sees the same trend in the New Canaan and Greenwich markets. Baby boomers who have sold the family house are looking for rental homes in walkable neighborhoods near the center of New Canaan or a block off the Greenwich Avenue commercial district.  ""People are more careful in making these transitional decisions,"" she said. ""Particularly for people who have just sold a house — they don't want to get tied down right away.""  Over the summer, Scott and Nina Ackerman, both 49, decided not to buy immediately after selling the home in Rye, N.Y., where they lived for 17 years. Mr. Ackerman was transitioning out of a career on Wall Street to open Club Pilates studios in Fairfield County, and two of their three sons had gone away to school. But as the couple considered the ample supply of houses for sale in New Canaan and Darien, their preferred towns, they couldn't find exactly what they wanted. ""I felt like, why force the issue of buying when you can rent?"" Mr. Ackerman said.  They are now renting a four-bedroom home in Darien for $7,000 a month. And ""home prices seem to be coming our way,"" he said. ""We made a good sale, and I think we're going to have an opportunity."" Younger couples are also taking their time with those transitions. Harper and Scott Mates spent a year renting a seven-bedroom house in Rye, N.Y., before deciding to buy their own home there this summer. Coming from the city with three young children, they knew they wanted to stay within reasonable commuting distance of their jobs, but weren't certain Rye would be the best choice.  ""We both commute every day,"" said Ms. Mates, 36, who works in private equity. ""Renting afforded us the ability to say, well, actually maybe we want to be in Greenwich.""  Instead they fell for Rye, where the median sale price of a house was just under $2 million in July. As the end of their lease approached in August, they jumped on a five-bedroom house on an acre within a few days of its listing.  Renting for a year didn't necessarily enable them to get a better deal on a house, said Mr. Mates, 39, who also works in finance, but it prevented them from making a costly mistake. ""Spending all this money on rent for a year is a heck of a lot cheaper than buying a place we don't like and having to sell it and move again,"" he said.  And they know they are not alone in their thinking: At a recent play date with children in their oldest child's kindergarten class, the Mates met three other families who had done exactly the same thing.

briefing,2018-09-28, (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/briefing/brett-kavanaugh-elon-musk-night-school.html,1405,"  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote this morning on the Supreme Court nominee, a day after emotional testimony that riveted the nation. Read our article about Thursday's hearing. Two accounts unfolded on Thursday: Christine Blasey Ford, her voice shaking at times, said a drunken Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. He angrily denied the accusation and denounced a partisan ""frenzy"" bent on destroying his nomination, his family and his good name. President Trump praised Judge Kavanaugh, saying that he had ""showed America exactly why I nominated him."" • Highlights: Here are four takeaways from the testimony and video of key moments. • Analysis: Dr. Blasey said she was ""100 percent"" certain that Mr. Kavanaugh was her attacker. He said he was ""100 percent"" certain that he was not. What will senators say? • Lindsey Graham: The South Carolina Republican was particularly incensed during Thursday's hearing. ""What you want to do is destroy this guy's life,"" he yelled at his Democratic colleagues. • Developing: The American Bar Association called for postponing a vote on Judge Kavanaugh until after an F.B.I. investigation. At nearly nine hours, Thursday's hearing was ""a political drama that doubled as a reality show,"" our media correspondent writes. ""It was an interrogation of gender, class and power in #MeToo America. It was a duel of clashing narrators. And it had elements of a major sports broadcast, a showdown between rival squads complete with halftime commentary."" Read more here. • Americans transfixed: We spoke to people around the country. • Two voices: The political and gender divide played out not just in what Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett Kavanaugh said, but in how they said it, our TV critic writes. • Partisan picks: Writers across the political spectrum discuss the hearing. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that the world was at ""the dawn of a new day""  over North Korea. But he added that economic sanctions must continue until the Korean Peninsula was completely denuclearized. • Also at the U.N.: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel told the General Assembly that his spies had found a ""secret atomic warehouse"" in Tehran storing ""massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran's secret nuclear weapons program."" The chief executive of Tesla was accused of fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed a lawsuit on Thursday seeking to bar him from serving as an executive or director of any public company. Last month, Mr. Musk shocked investors by declaring on Twitter that he had ""funding secured"" to take the company private.

Op-Ed,2018-09-28,"GUANGZHOU, China — Earlier this month, Jack Ma announced that he was stepping down as executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the world’s largest e-commerce company. His decision caught many by surprise. At an economic forum in Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin reportedly asked him, “You are still so young. Why are you retiring?”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/opinion/jack-ma-alibaba-china-economy.html,1132," GUANGZHOU, China — Earlier this month, Jack Ma announced that he was stepping down as executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the world's largest e-commerce company. His decision caught many by surprise. At an economic forum in Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin reportedly asked him, ""You are still so young. Why are you retiring?"" Maybe Mr. Ma, 54, knows something that Mr. Putin does not. Two of the three forces, globalization and marketization, that have propelled Alibaba to its current $500 billion valuation are dissipating. The third force, technology, is mired in the trade war between China and the United States, and its prospects in China are now uncertain. Alibaba didn't just transform e-commerce in China; it transformed the entire economy by helping build up the private sector. Mr. Ma's departure from the company now — though he claims to have been planning it for a while — adds to a gathering sense that China's private sector, the engine of the economy, is losing steam — and faith. Alibaba is China's globalization story par excellence. Founded in 1999, the company created a website that allowed people outside China to buy directly from Chinese exporters. At that time, China was opening up but foreign buyers were hampered by their lack of knowledge of Chinese suppliers. Alibaba set up a program called TrustPass, allowing third parties to verify the quality and trustworthiness of Chinese suppliers. This system enabled foreign buyers to bypass the slow and often bureaucratic state-owned intermediaries that typically performed verification, and it eased Chinese companies' access to the global marketplace. Alibaba also tapped international capital markets. The company's founders hailed from modest backgrounds and had little capital, but they benefited from liberal policies that China had put in place as it was negotiating to join the World Trade Organization (which it did join, in 2001). During the company's early years, its leaders turned to foreign suppliers of capital, such as Goldman Sachs, SoftBank and Fidelity Investments. Later on, Yahoo also provided funding. In the early 2000s, Alibaba structured its investment arrangements via what are known as ""variable interest entities."" V.I.E.s are intermediary structures in which foreign firms can invest to acquire contractual rights over revenues generated by Alibaba. They were an innovative solution to help foreigners navigate China's murky legal system while bringing critical financing to Chinese high-tech entrepreneurs. But today globalization is under assault. The Chinese government is enforcing more strictly regulations over V.I.E.s that it had long ignored, creating uncertainty for foreign investors. And the trade war between the United States and China is disrupting Chinese exports, threatening the supply chains of which Alibaba is an integral component. Alibaba has elevated China's private entrepreneurs in another way: by providing direct financing to them. China has a massive banking system, but it is almost entirely organized to support the less efficient state-owned enterprises, leaving China's dynamic private sector chronically short of capital and credit. Alibaba, through its financing operations, has stepped in to provide much-needed capital, especially to China's very small businesses. But Alibaba is operating against broader political and economic headwinds, and China is now reducing the indebtedness of its economy, mostly by cutting credit to the private sector. As a result, according to one analysis in The Wall Street Journal, interest burdens on private companies have risen, whereas they have fallen for state-owned enterprises (and returns on assets, a measure of profitability, have fallen for private companies while rising for S.O.E.s). The government, fearing the instability of shadow banking, is also stepping up controls on independent funding channels. For example, it has tightened regulations on some forms of mobile payment, like those operated by Alibaba. Such financial controls are likely to increase in the future. Under increasingly tight financial and regulatory pressures, China's private sector today arguably is facing the most challenging environment since the early 1990s. According to the chief economist of China Merchant Bank, all 11,000 businesses that went bankrupt between 2016 and the first half of 2018 were private. After liberalizing the economy for nearly four decades, the government appears to be reversing course. By one count, 10 privately owned groups have in effect been nationalized this year, when, strapped for financing because of tightening credit controls, they sold their equity stakes to S.O.E.s. The Chinese government even seems openly hostile toward the private sector. A vice-minister of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security recently said that private enterprises should be ""jointly"" run by private entrepreneurs and workers. The comment smacked of Mao Zedong's justification for nationalizing China's private sector in the mid-1950s. In a recent blog post, one Wu Xiaoping, who identified himself as a ""veteran in China's financial sector,"" argued that China's private sector, having helped ""the state-owned economy in achieving its rapid development,"" should not ""blindly expand"" but instead embrace mixed ownership. The essay caused widespread consternation — even a degree of panic — among Chinese entrepreneurs. In conversations I had in Guangdong, business leaders from various sectors — product design, investment, technology — called the current situation ""dire."" They said they were making far fewer deals, as much as 50 percent less, now than during the same period last year and complained about the toll of increasing taxes. The third leg of Alibaba's growth, technology, is also shakier now than when the company was founded. Technology itself continues to develop rapidly, but both the United States and China want to go it alone. The Trump administration is limiting Chinese investments in American technology. The Chinese government's ""Made in China 2025"" initiative, a vast program to develop advanced manufacturing, curbs foreign participation with equity restrictions and onerous requirements about technology transfer. These are not the conditions that allowed Alibaba to succeed. The company was a pioneer in adopting Western technology and business models — using online commerce, data analytics, website tools — to the Chinese context. Although it is often called China's Amazon, the comparison vastly understates its true significance. Alibaba started out as a business-to-business operation but, really, it gave market opportunities to private entrepreneurs in a statist system heavily stacked against them. Many of these entrepreneurs are located in remote rural regions, and China has a highly uneven distribution of income and production. Income is concentrated in a few metropolitan centers, whereas production is distributed throughout the country. Alibaba connects production in these disparate regions to the sources of market demand and consumption. The links it provides aren't just technological; they are broadly economic. So why is the Chinese government clamping down on the private sector when liberalizing it has served the economy so well? The reasons are varied and complex: rising authoritarianism at home, statism, the trade war. But the effects already are clear, with ominous implications for the entire economy. Could there even be a new Alibaba today?"
News,2018-09-28,Good Friday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/business/dealbook/elon-musk-tesla-sec.html,1527," Good Friday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The S.E.C. has accused the Tesla C.E.O. of fraud over his brief effort to take the carmaker private. Mr. Musk reportedly backed out of a settlement with the agency Thursday morning, adamant that he had done nothing wrong. If the commission convinces a jury that Mr. Musk misled investors, he could be blocked from serving as an executive or director of any public company. That could force him to assume a different position at Tesla. It could also affect his other companies, SpaceX and the Boring Company, were they to go public, and potentially harm their ability to raise money from investors. The S.E.C. lawsuit, filed on Thursday in federal court, said that Mr. Musk had made a false public statement by tweeting that he had ""funding secured"" to buy out Tesla investors. Some legal experts think he has a tough battle ahead: Charles Elson of the University of Delaware called the case ""as straightforward as you can get."" Andrew's take: Mr. Musk will want to prove that his intent wasn't to mislead investors, probably by demonstrating that he had real conversations to take the company private. But his intent is almost beside the point. He can be found guilty simply for being ""reckless."" And naïveté isn't a defense. This is turning into a sad story for Tesla's employees, investors and ultimately everyone who has followed Mr. Musk's efforts to transform the auto and energy industries. Nearly $3.3 trillion worth of mergers have been announced this year, the FT reports. That's the strongest showing for the first nine months of a year since 2007, and puts deal making in 2018 on a potentially record-setting pace. The data suggest that companies still feel confident enough about the economy to strike big deals. Much of this year's activity was driven by giant takeovers like Walt Disney's acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox and T-Mobile's proposed acquisition of Sprint. What remains to be seen is whether trade wars and other economic sandbags will weigh down the M.&A. run. More in M.&A.: The investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners reportedly hired advisers for a potential I.P.O., betting on the M.&A. boom to create investor interest in its offering. In March 2017, State Street Global Advisors, one of the world's largest fund managers, pushed companies to put more women on corporate boards. FactSet has crunched the numbers, and there's a long way to go: • Companies in the Russell 3000 stock index with no female board members declined to 18 percent, from 23 percent. • Companies in which women hold 15 percent of the board seats or less decreased to 47 percent, from 58 percent. • The boards of 22 companies are equally split between men and women, while women make up the majority at 14 companies, up from five. • Just 5 percent of companies in the index are led by women, unchanged from March 2017. The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony struck many commentators as credible, but Judge Kavanaugh's fiery defense may give Republican senators cover to approve his nomination. Google's C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, will meet with Republican lawmakers. He is expected to discuss the company's work in China, its market dominance and allegations of political bias in its search results. The Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish consumer spending data. Spending is expected to have risen 0.3 percent in August, compared to a 0.4 percent rise in July. Personal income is also expected to have grown 0.4 percent. The yield curve is essentially the difference between interest rates on short-term government bonds and long-term government bonds. Every time since 1960 that it has inverted — when long-term rates are lower than short-term rates — a recession has followed. For much of this year, the spread has been at its narrowest level in more than a decade. Many economists believe it will invert next year. But Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, has played down the yield curve's significance as an omen. The curve is ""just one factor that you want to look at"" when setting interest-rate policy, he said. Of the economy as a whole, he added, ""there's no reason to think that the probability of a recession in the next year or two is at all elevated."" Counterpoint: Martin Feldstein, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan and a professor at Harvard, argues in a WSJ op-ed that a long, deep recession is looming — and the Fed has few tools to solve it. SoftBank and other investment firms are reportedly in talks to invest in Bytedance, a Chinese tech company that owns the video service Tik Tok. The deal could value the company at $75 billion, which would make it one of the most valuable venture-backed start-ups around. More from Lulu Yilun Chen, Selina Wang and David Ramli of Bloomberg on why Bytedance is so attractive: Six-year-old Bytedance, which was said to be seeking around $3 billion in the current round, started out by using artificial intelligence to personalize content for users but has successfully branched out into short-video via a service called Douyin, known as Tik Tok abroad. That service had 500 million monthly active users as of July. It also owns the Musical.ly app, which has about 100 million users and is being merged with Tik Tok, the company said in August. One reason for investor caution: With companies like Tencent getting involved in short video, Tik Tok may struggle to grow in a saturated market. Apple's business model is different from those of other tech giants: Instead of generating cash from advertising, it simply sells expensive products. In his latest column, Farhad Manjoo of the NYT considers how that has insulated the iPhone maker from most of the tech industry's troubles in recent years. But he also wonders what might happen if other companies embraced its vision: If Apple's more deliberate business becomes the widely followed norm, we could see an industry that is more careful about tech's dangers and excesses. It could also be one that is more exclusive, where the wealthy get the best innovations and the poor bear more of the risks. The financial crisis ruined Goldman Sachs's reputation in the eyes of the public. Ten years on, it is finally out of the doghouse. Data from YouGov shows that slightly more Americans would feel ""proud,"" rather than ""embarrassed,"" to work at Goldman. That's after the firm spent years trying to rehabilitate its image. But let's not get carried away. On YouGov's reputation scale, which runs from -100 to 100, Goldman crawled into positive territory with a score of 1. Jeffrey Davis has stepped down as C.F.O. of J.C. Penney. Bed Bath & Beyond will keep Victoria Morrison as a director despite investors voting her out. Natalie Baylis is stepping down as head of compliance at GAM, the troubled Swiss investment firm.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Yes, the robots are coming. But they're not as a clever as you are. At least not yet. My name is Cade Metz, and here at The New York Times I cover emerging technologies, which is a fancy term for cool stuff that is probably not as cool as you think it is. My stock example: driverless cars. Driverless cars are very cool. They're a little less cool when they're trying to make an unprotected left-hand turn against oncoming traffic and they just sit there because, unlike human drivers, they don't realize that there comes a time when you just have to go. Much the same applies to robots in general. Last time in this esteemed newsletter, my colleague Steve Lohr warned that automation would change the economy. But as he also explained, jobs are ""more likely to be transformed by digital technology than destroyed by it."" This becomes clear as you look a little closer at the progress of robotics, including everything from the robotic arms that help build stuff in factories to the jaw-droppingly agile machines under development at a company called Boston Dynamics. This past week, I wrote about Boston Dynamics, which runs a semi-secretive lab in Waltham, Mass., about 10 miles outside Boston. Built to move like animals and even humans, its machines are truly amazing (as YouTube watchers will attest). At times, you can't help but think of these mechanical creations as living things. The company will start selling one of them, a doglike robot called SpotMini, in the coming year. But even Boston Dynamics is not quite sure what these robots are actually good for. Robots play tricks on the mind. We tend to think they are more advanced than they really are, perhaps because of science fiction movies or because our brains are wired to believe in bots. This is particularly true when it comes to the biomimetic machines inside a lab like Boston Dynamics. ""When we see a biped that looks like a person or a quadruped that looks like a dog, we project our previous experiences with people and dogs onto these machines. But, in fact, there is nothing inside,"" said Gill Pratt, who worked with Boston Dynamics as an official at Darpa, a research arm of the Defense Department, and is now exploring new forms of robotics as the chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute. ""It is like a hollow doll."" Keep that in mind as you think about any other robot. The week I visited Boston Dynamics, I spent time with about 25 other roboticists — which was not hard in the Boston area. Cambridge breeds them as if they were really smart rabbits. As countless start-ups have emerged from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard over the past two decades, they have spread across Boston, into Somerville and on to Waltham. One company at the leading edge of the real world is RightHand Robotics, which is fashioning ""picking"" robots inside an old post office building in Somerville. Presented with a bin full of stuff, they can grab and pick up individual objects, even if they haven't seen them before. This is just what a company like Amazon need inside its massive distribution centers. But companies like RightHand are still perfecting the art of picking. And the next task — deciding where each object should go — is even harder. Right now, RightHand is leaning on systems that scan the bar code attached to each item. Identifying items without bar codes is harder still. When you consider that Amazon is growing at a tremendous rate, there is no shortage of jobs for good old humans inside those distribution centers. And that won't change for a while. But I will say this: The technology is improving faster than ever before. But enough with the robots. There is more to consider in the here and now: ■ President Trump is kicking his China trade war into overdrive. He says this will maintain American greatness in the face of Beijing's master plan to dominate the technological future. But as our Washington tech correspondent, Cecilia Kang, reports, American tech and telecom companies paint a different picture. ■ The Facebook saga continues, as you knew it would. Our Silicon Valley correspondent Mike Isaac returned from book leave with a scoop: Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, the founders of Instagram, the hugely popular, photo-tastic social network owned by Facebook, are leaving the company. And here is why. ■ No, it's not at Facebook levels yet, but the Google saga is picking up steam. Three weeks ago, Google did not attend a Senate hearing dedicated to Russian disinformation on social media, refusing to send a top executive. But the company was on the Capitol Hill hot seat this pat week, as lawmakers questioned whether Google services are silencing conservative voices. Daisuke Wakabayashi and Ms. Kang reported. ■ Of course, the real issue is Russian disinformation. Check out columnist Kevin Roose's piece on USAReally, a website that is not what it might seem. Hint: It's based in Moscow. ■ Back in the really real U.S.A., Amazon is turning Seattle into one giant tech lab. The company's cashierless grocery store, which opened near the downtown area in January, is now a tourist destination, and that is just one way the company is testing its latest ideas in the Great Northwest. Our Seattle tech correspondent, Karen Weise, took readers on a tour. There are no robots. Yet. Cade Metz writes about emerging technologies for The New York Times.

News,2018-09-28,BERLIN — A three-day state visit to Germany by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was supposed to be aimed at repairing relations at a time of a looming economic crisis at home.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/world/europe/erdogan-turkey-germany.html,1090," BERLIN — A three-day state visit to Germany by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was supposed to be aimed at repairing relations at a time of a looming economic crisis at home. But if Mr. Erdogan was on a charm offensive, Germans seemed to agree that, after just 24 hours in Berlin, it was more offensive than charm. The first thing the Turkish president did? Mr. Erdogan apparently flashed a four-fingered Muslim Brotherhood salute in central Berlin and demanded the extradition of 69 Turkish exiles in Germany, among them journalists and lawyers investigating Mr. Erdogan's government and risking prison at home. Chancellor Angela Merkel was not impressed. Standing stiffly next to the Turkish leader at a news conference in Berlin on Friday, she noted ""deep-seated differences"" between the two countries regarding press freedom and the rule of law, and she insisted that Mr. Erdogan release several political prisoners held in Turkey — including five German citizens. ""I have urged that these cases be solved as quickly as possible,"" Ms. Merkel said, as Mr. Erdogan stared straight ahead. Facing the worst economic crisis in his country in 15 years, the Turkish leader had toned down his anti-Western rhetoric in recent weeks. Only a year ago, he called the German government ""enemies of Turkey."" Turkish officials accused Berlin of deploying Nazi tactics, and Turkish newspapers called German companies in Turkey spies. This week, Mr. Erdogan said, ""We want to completely leave behind all the problems and to create a warm environment between Turkey and Germany — just like it used to be."" But the facade tumbled quickly, as it has tumbled before. Among the names on the extradition list, which was submitted to the Foreign Ministry in Berlin on Monday, according to the Turkish newspaper Yeni Akit, is Can Dundar, the former editor in chief of the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet. Mr. Dundar fled Turkey in 2016 after he was convicted of treason and espionage for reporting a year earlier that Turkey's Secret Service had delivered arms to the Islamic State. His wife remains in Turkey and is not allowed to leave the country. When Mr. Erdogan was informed that Mr. Dundar planned to be at the news conference with Ms. Merkel, the Turkish president threatened to call off the whole thing. In the end, Mr. Dundar said he would not go to ensure that colleagues would have an opportunity to ask Mr. Erdogan critical questions. Asked whether Ms. Merkel considered it a provocation that Mr. Dundar's name was on the extradition list, the chancellor was blunt: ""It's no secret that there is controversy in this case."" Mr. Erdogan, meanwhile, reiterated that Mr. Dundar was ""an agent"" who had published state secrets. Though not holding back her criticism, Ms. Merkel was visibly uncomfortable with a joint appearance that showed clumsy diplomacy not just from the Turkish president but also from a Western power that ultimately has to deal with a budding dictator on Europe's border. At one point during the news conference, a photographer in the front row slipped on a T-shirt with a message of support for journalists jailed in Turkey. The man, a photographer for a Turkish-language news site in Germany, was swiftly removed by security personnel as Mr. Erdogan looked on and smiled. The newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung described the scene as one ""you'd expect more in Erdogan's Turkey."" Ms. Merkel stressed that Germany and Turkey, both NATO members, had many shared strategic interests. She announced a meeting with the leaders of France, Turkey and Russia in October to discuss the situation in Syria, in particular the rebel stronghold of Idlib. ""We have a lot that unites us,"" she said at the news conference, singling out questions of migration and the fight against terrorism. She also expressed hope that Turkey's economic turmoil would abate. ""Germany has an interest in an economically stable Turkey,"" she said. Mr. Erdogan is secure in his newly powerful presidency. But the Turkish economy is in bad shape. The lira has come under severe pressure — losing nearly 40 percent of its value this year — buffeted by high inflation and surging foreign debt. As the lira has fallen in value, Turkish companies have struggled to make debt payments. But if the Turkish president was looking to reassure financial markets, improve business ties and seek political support, he went about it clumsily. A photograph of him driving through Berlin and making what appeared to be the hand sign of Muslim Brotherhood supporters — one used by Mr. Erdogan on previous occasions — was widely shared on German social media. ""It's hard to see how to mock the values of our country more,"" Julian Reichelt, the editor of Bild, said on Twitter. Cem Ozdemir, a Turkish-German lawmaker and longtime Erdogan critic, put it in an interview with the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: ""Erdogan has no intention of changing his spots, despite his attempts at a charm offensive."" Mr. Erdogan's diplomatic approach was reminiscent of his trip to Greece last winter, which went less than swimmingly — the Turkish leader suggested readjusting borders, even before he arrived in Athens. The state visit in Germany is hosted by the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial. It has been met with a wave of criticism. Thousands of protesters, including many of Turkish origin, took to the streets of Berlin near Mr. Erdogan's hotel on Friday afternoon. One banner, held by a Kurdish woman standing near the Brandenburg Gate read, ""Erdogan you're not a leader, you're a dictator."" Another declared, ""Get lost, Erdogan!"" More protests are planned for Saturday in Cologne, where Mr. Erdogan is scheduled to open a new central mosque of one of Germany's largest Islamic organizations. The group, the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs, or Ditib, is financed by the Turkish government and is suspected of disseminating pro-Erdogan propaganda. Several German lawmakers joined the protests rather than attend a state banquet on Friday night. Bijan Djir-Sarai, the foreign policy speaker of the Free Democrats, said he could not dine with Mr. Erdogan ""while German citizens sit in Turkish prisons."" The temperature rose briefly at the dinner when Mr. Steinmeier's criticism of Turkey for pursuing government critics drew a response from Mr. Erdogan. The intellectuals and journalists wanted by the Turkish justice system, Mr. Erdogan said, are ""terrorists"" and Germany is ""protecting them."" Beforehand, Ms. Merkel had defended the decision to host Mr. Erdogan, saying, ""We can only work through our differences if we talk to each other."" But she, too, was conspicuously absent from the state banquet."

The list of topics includes: ■ Worse-than-expected data that could show the economy is slowing. ■ Local government debt risks. ■ The impact of the trade war with the United States. ■ Signs of declining consumer confidence■ The risks of stagflation, or rising prices coupled with slowing economic growth ■ ""Hot-button issues to show the difficulties of people's lives."" The government's new directive betrays a mounting anxiety among Chinese leaders that the country could be heading into a growing economic slump. Even before the trade war between the United States and China, residents of the world's second-largest economy were showing signs of keeping a tight grip on their wallets. Industrial profit growth has slowed for four consecutive months, and China's stock market is near its lowest level in four years. ""It's possible that the situation is more serious than previously thought or that they want to prevent a panic,"" said Zhang Ming, a retired political science professor from Renmin University in Beijing. Mr. Zhang said the effect of the expanded censorship strategy could more readily cause people to believe rumors about the economy. ""They are worried about chaos,"" he added. ""But in barring the media from reporting, things may get more chaotic."" The directive didn't appear to affect run-of-mill daily coverage of economic data, which could still be widely found online in China on Friday. Instead, the directive appeared to be aimed at easing the overall tone. Indeed, another notice sent on Friday instructed online news outlets to remove comments at the bottom of news articles that ""bad-mouth the Chinese economy."" These topics pertain to ""China's economic downturn,"" ""China's stagflation,"" ""new refugees,"" ""consumption downgrading"" and ""other harmful remarks that criticize the development prospects of China,"" according to a copy of the notice reviewed by The Times. Consumption downgrading refers to Chinese consumers looking for ways to spend less. China's propaganda department couldn't be reached late Friday for comment. Negative economic news could undermine the careful message Chinese officials have tried to transmit to the public in recent months. They have said that the country's vast and growing ranks of consumers, as well as China's increasing sophistication in technology and other areas, would help it weather any ill effects from rising American tariffs. At the same time, officials have made moves to juice the economy. The government has loosened restrictions on big but costly local government projects like subways and light rail lines. It has also promised tax cuts for businesses and other efforts to generate more construction. The trade war could certainly worsen the economic climate if it lingers, leading to job losses and even weaker consumer sentiment. But China has more deep-seated economic problems. Officials are trying to clean up huge debts accumulated by local governments. Curbing debt could mean slower economic growth, as it deprives borrowers of the funds they would otherwise spend. China has long maintained a tight grip on the media, though the economy traditionally has been one of the freer domains of reporting. Even after China began more closely managing its economic message following market turmoil in 2015, aggressive journalists have covered the fallout of peer-to-peer online lending schemes and the problems posed by local government debt, among other issues. On paper, China's gross domestic product, its main economic figure, indicates smooth sailing. But the figure is widely doubted, and many economists are forecasting a slowdown to varying degrees. Mark Williams, chief Asia economist of Capital Economics, said the firm expects the Chinese economy to slow down to 5 to 5.5 percent from 6.9 percent last year. Despite the lower forecast, he stressed that it was ""not a weak number"" for the Chinese economy. ""One of the problems is there's a lot of doubt about official Chinese data,"" Mr. Williams said. ""And when they come out with these directives, it just raises more questions."" In the past year, domestic news media have had to write their stories on the economy with a gentler tone, said a journalist covering finance for a Chinese business newspaper, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. Censors have also erased online commentary that contained the phrases ""consumption downgrade,"" taxes, debt and unemployment, according to the Journalism and Media Studies Center at the University of Hong Kong, which monitors censorship on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media service. One post that was removed by censors said: ""The bad news in the market is exploding, pessimistic viewpoints are spreading, many retail investors are in despair."" Another read: ""Will the emergence of robots free up labor or cause unemployment and poverty?"" The scrutiny over economic news adds to a broader pattern of the tightening of control over media since President Xi Jinping came into power in 2012. Particularly online, the Chinese government has centralized and beefed up regulatory agencies that monitor content. Recently, the agencies have come down harder on entertainment news and celebrity gossip, in addition to political and social issues. On Wednesday, Phoenix News Media, a Hong Kong-based outlet with big operations in mainland China, said the Chinese authorities had instructed it to ""rectify"" its news portal, ifeng.com. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's main internet regulator, said that Phoenix had ""disseminated illegal and harmful information, distorted news headlines and shared news information in violation of rules."" Two weeks earlier, NetEase, an online news portal, said it had to suspend updating its financial platform ""because of serious problems."""
News,2018-09-29,"TOKYO — When Hiromi Otsuzuki joined the Japanese software company Isana.net as human resources manager four years ago, she was the only part-time employee.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/business/japan-work-jobs-women.html,1244," TOKYO — When Hiromi Otsuzuki joined the Japanese software company Isana.net as human resources manager four years ago, she was the only part-time employee. Working just 15 hours a week so that she could care for her stepson made Ms. Otsuzuki an outcast in a country that is notorious for the long hours office workers spend at their desks. Her colleagues called her ""part-no obasan,"" or part-time auntie. Despite being a specialist, she was asked to organize bags for recycling. ""Within the company, nobody would accept me,"" Ms. Otsuzuki, 48, said. Things are better now. She is no longer the only part-time worker in the office, and she has been promoted. Judging by the numbers, things are looking up for other mothers in the Japanese work force. According to a government survey released in July, nearly 71 percent of women with children were working, as of Japan's most recent fiscal year, which ended in March. That is the highest level on record, and a 14-percentage-point increase since 2004. But the figures mask some major problems with the quality of work available to working mothers. Under pressure at home to maintain their child-rearing responsibilities, many professionally minded mothers are opting for part-time work. In Japan, that means accepting meager benefits, little job security, few opportunities for advancement and pay that is often so low that women's rights advocates have described it as exploitation. Only one in four mothers in Japan was employed full time in the last fiscal year. ""Every company thinks that opening doors and hiring women is the end goal,"" said Kaori Sasaki, chair of the Committee for the International Conference for Women in Business. ""But actually, that is the starting point."" After graduating from a junior college in 1992, Ms. Otsuzuki spent 19 years in jobs that included secretary and human resources staff member, mostly at the electronics giant Sony and NHK, the national broadcaster. In 2011, she married a man who had a 10-year-old son, and she felt obligated to leave her career and care for the boy. She found life at home more stressful than being at work, and after three years she decided to find a job. ""In Japan, housewives have very high expectation from society and mothers-in-law,"" she said. ""It was too much pressure."" Finding a suitable position proved to be harder than she had anticipated. ""Companies don't value experience, because they have their own way of doing things,"" she said. ""I had to act like a freshman."" Managers who showed an interest in hiring her also insisted that she work full time. But with the continuing tug of household responsibilities, Ms. Otsuzuki preferred fewer, and more flexible, hours. It took Ms. Otsuzuki six months to land the position at Isana.net, with an initial hourly wage that was about 40 percent of what she had earned in her last full-time job. Although Ms. Otsuzuki has managed to strike a balance between home and office, many other working mothers find that the pull between the two makes it difficult for them to stay in jobs. After she had her second child, in 2013, Misa Masuo, a longtime employee of the cosmetics company Shiseido, moved into a position as a saleswoman in a department store that allowed her to work fewer hours. Two years later, she resigned, overwhelmed by her dual duties. At home, she was what is known in Japan as ""one-ope child care,"" or one-person operation. She was expected to go home after work and cook, clean and bathe the children — a task she describes as ""always chaotic"" — entirely on her own. Ms. Masuo's husband, a chef, worked long hours at a restaurant and did little to help with the children beyond ushering them to day care each morning. At work, Ms. Masuo, 39, felt a constant sense of guilt that she was imposing extra responsibilities on her fellow saleswomen, especially during busy shopping hours. ""I was always saying 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry' to colleagues, as I dashed home from work early,"" she recalled. Such challenges frequently derail women's careers and contribute to a gender pay gap that is the third biggest among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's member countries, behind only South Korea and Estonia. ""The quality of jobs given to women is not that high,"" said Machiko Osawa, director of the Research Institute for Women and Careers at Japan Women's University. ""That has to be improved. Then not only are women working but they contribute more."" Severe economic pressures are forcing some change. Managers are experiencing labor shortages amid low unemployment and an aging labor force, making them more willing to accommodate working mothers. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has also made the inclusion of women in the workplace part of his campaign to revive Japan's long-stagnant economy. He has promised better access to child care, and Parliament has introduced legislation that would require large companies to publicly state their goals for hiring women. ""A lot of companies are desperate for workers,"" said Ichiro Masumura, president of BStyle, an employment agency based in Tokyo that specializes in placing female workers in jobs, including through its website, ""shufu-job.jp,"" which translates to housewife-job. Advocates for women, however, contend that more needs to be done. Tougher laws that promote gender equality in the workplace are necessary, they argue, and better training is required to sensitize male executives to the needs of their female staff members. As of now, progress is coming on a smaller scale. Isana Ishitani, who founded Isana.net in 2001, had never considered hiring housewives. But as the company grew, there were important tasks that were best suited to part-time workers. Watching his sister-in-law get pushed out of a software company after having a child also heightened his awareness of the trials faced by working mothers. ""That gave me an idea of what is happening in the work environment and culture in Japan,"" Mr. Ishitani said. ""I thought that was a very good opportunity for a midsize company like us to hire people."" Asked about Ms. Otsuzuki's early experiences at Isana.net, Mr. Ishitani said that when he started hiring part-time workers, he did not want to distinguish between their roles and responsibilities and those of the company's full-time staff members. But he acknowledged that because Japanese workers often see part-time work as suited only for menial or mechanical tasks, ""our idea was not fully understood by our team initially."" ""But I believe now they do,"" he added. Since hiring Ms. Otsuzuki, Isana.net has built a team of eight mothers who work part time — out of about 45 workers in total. Ms. Otsuzuki's status has improved, too. This year, she received a promotion and a pay raise that nearly doubled her hourly income. Even though she still works part time, she also gets the same benefits as a full-time employee. Mr. Ishitani now allows Isana.net employees to bring their children to the office if necessary and to switch between full- and part-time hours to care for children or, as is increasingly the case, older parents. ""We want the employees to work for our company until they retire,"" he said. ""This is an old Japanese idea. In order to do that, people need to adapt to a lot of things in their lives."" In the meantime, Ms. Otsuzuki said, the rest of Japan has no choice but to include people like her. ""Luckily, Japan is so short of workers,"" she said, ""that even 'part-no obasan' are welcome."""
News,2018-09-29,"Sometimes the most important economic events announce themselves with huge front-page headlines, stock market collapses and frantic intervention by government officials.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/upshot/mini-recession-2016-little-known-big-impact.html,2840," Sometimes the most important economic events announce themselves with huge front-page headlines, stock market collapses and frantic intervention by government officials. Other times, a hard-to-explain confluence of forces has enormous economic implications, yet comes and goes without most people even being aware of it. In 2015 and 2016, the United States experienced the second type of event. There was a sharp slowdown in business investment, caused by an interrelated weakening in emerging markets, a drop in the price of oil and other commodities, and a run-up in the value of the dollar. The pain was confined mostly to the energy and agricultural sectors and to the portions of the manufacturing economy that supply them with equipment. Overall economic growth slowed but remained in positive territory. The national unemployment rate kept falling. Anyone who didn't work in energy, agriculture or manufacturing could be forgiven for not noticing it at all. Yet understanding this slump — think of it as a mini-recession — is important in many ways.  It helps explain the economic growth spurt of the last two years. The end of the mini-recession in the spring of 2016 created a capital spending rebound that began in mid-2016, and it has contributed to speedier growth since. Oil prices have reached four-year highs, a major factor in a surge in business investment this year. It helps explain some of the economic discontent evident in manufacturing-heavy areas during the 2016 elections. It offers warnings for where the next downturn might come from, and shows how important it is for policymakers to remain watchful and flexible about unpredictable shifts in the global economy. Most important, the mini-recession of 2015-16 offers a cautionary tale for any policymaker who might want to think of the United States as an economic island. The episode is stark evidence of the risk the Trump administration faces in threatening economic damage to negotiate leverage with other nations on trade and security. What happens overseas can return to American shores faster and more powerfully than once seemed possible. The mini-recession defies neatness. It's a story of spillovers and feedback loops and unintended consequences. But here's a summary: In 2015, Chinese leaders were concerned that their economy was experiencing a credit bubble, and they began imposing policies to restrain growth. These worked too well and caused a steep slowdown. That in turn caused troubles in other emerging nations for whom China was a major customer. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve, finally growing confident that the United States economy was returning to health, made plans to end its era of ultra-easy monetary policy. As the Fed moved toward tighter money, its counterparts at the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were going in the opposite direction. The prospect of higher interest rates in the United States and lower rates in the eurozone and Japan fueled a steep rise in the value of the dollar on global currency markets. That in turn made China's problems worse. China had long pegged the value of its currency to the dollar, so a stronger dollar was also making Chinese companies less competitive globally. When China attempted to reduce this burden by loosening the peg in August 2015, it faced capital outflows, making the economic situation worse. Moreover, across major emerging markets, many companies and banks had borrowed money in dollars, so a stronger dollar made their debt burdens more onerous. Put it all together, and when the Fed moved toward raising interest rates — as it eventually did in December 2015 — it was essentially making financial conditions tighter and therefore slowing growth across big swaths of the world. The slowdown across emerging markets, in turn, meant less demand for oil and many other commodities. That helped cause their prices to fall. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell to under $30 in February 2016 from around $106 in June 2014. The drops in the prices of metals like copper and aluminum, and agricultural products like corn and soybeans, were also steep. That only heightened the economic pain for the many emerging economies that are major commodity producers, such as Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia. Given falling prices and high debt loads among energy producers in the United States, the markets for stocks and riskier corporate bonds came under stress, especially in early 2016. That generated losses for investors and fears about the overall stability of the financial system. Each of these forces has connections to the others. It wasn't one problem, but an intersection of a bunch of them. That made it devilishly hard to diagnose, let alone to fix, even for the people whose job was to do just that. When Federal Reserve officials meet eight times a year to set interest rate policy, their job, assigned by Congress, is to figure out what is best for the United States economy. Their job isn't to set a policy that will be best for China or Brazil or Indonesia. Entering 2015, things were looking pretty good for the United States. Inflation was below the 2 percent level the Fed aims for, but the traditional economic models on which the central bankers had long relied predicted that it would start to rise thanks to a rapidly falling unemployment rate. Even when prices for oil and other commodities started falling in the middle of the year, the Fed's models viewed it as a positive for the overall economy. Sure, some oil drillers and farmers might experience lower incomes, but consumers everywhere would enjoy cheaper gasoline and grocery bills. Although officials spent a lot of time monitoring the global economy, the fact remained that the United States wasn't as dependent on exports as many smaller countries. The 2008 financial crisis had shown how the American and European banking systems were deeply intertwined, but the same couldn't be said of the ties with Chinese banks. In other words, through the summer of 2015 it sure looked to many Fed officials as if the sound move was to start raising interest rates. At the Treasury Department, which is responsible for the United States' currency policies, it seemed well into 2015 that the strengthening dollar was mostly benign. ""There was a sense that the U.S. was doing well and the rest of the world was not doing very well,"" said Nathan Sheets, a Treasury under secretary at the time and now chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income. ""It was driven by strong U.S. fundamentals."" But in late summer 2015, financial markets started to react more violently to the feedback loop of global currencies and commodities. It started to seem as if some of the old rules of thumb — about how a rising dollar or falling oil prices might affect the economy — might not apply. Perhaps the economics models used by forecasters had become outdated, failing to fully account for the ways surging energy production had become more intertwined with the manufacturing sector and the financial markets. ""These things were all interconnected in different ways, and they all cycled back on the same industries and parts of the economy,"" said Jay Shambaugh, a member of the Obama White House Council of Economic Advisers at the time. Still, distilling that complex story into crisp memos for senior officials was no easy task. ""You have to make memos short and to the point in the White House, and it was hard to say what exactly we thought was happening,"" he said. Behind closed doors at the Fed, officials started debating whether this outburst of volatility in markets really posed a risk to the overall economy. Should they stick to their plans to raise interest rates steadily, or slow down? Over two days in October, the debate played out publicly. Stan Fischer, the vice chairman of the Fed, was reluctant to adjust the planned rate increases, not wishing to let swings in financial markets dictate policy. ""We do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path for policy,"" he said in a speech in Lima, Peru, on Oct. 11, 2015. Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor who had worked on international issues at the Treasury, was quite a bit more worried. ""There is a risk that the intensification of international cross currents could weigh more heavily on U.S. demand directly, or that the anticipation of a sharper divergence in U.S. policy could impose restraint through additional tightening of financial conditions,"" she said on Oct. 12 in Washington. Ms. Brainard was right. The vicious circle of a stronger dollar, weaker emerging market growth and lower commodity prices caused spending on certain types of capital goods to plummet starting in mid-2015. Spending on agricultural machinery in 2016 fell 38 percent from 2014 levels; for petroleum and natural gas structures — think oil drilling rigs — the number was down a whopping 60 percent. The oil and gas exploration boom tied to fracking technology came to a halt with energy prices at rock-bottom levels, and with it sales of equipment tied to that boom.  With the fall in domestic capital investment in those industries and with weakness overseas, companies in related industries took it on the chin. Caterpillar, the maker of heavy equipment, had 30 percent lower revenue in 2016 than 2014. In large segments of the economy, by contrast, it was business as usual. Business spending on investments like computers and office buildings kept rising, as did consumer spending. Still, the industrial sector downturn was powerful enough to turn a strong expansion into a weak one. Overall growth fell to 1.3 percent in the four quarters ended in mid-2016, from 3.4 percent in the preceding year. The national economy kept adding jobs. But Harris County, Tex., which encompasses energy-centric Houston and its near suburbs, shed 0.8 percent of its jobs in that span. In Peoria, Ill., hometown of Caterpillar, employment fell 3.2 percent. In effect, this was a localized recession — severe in certain places, but concentrated enough that it did not throw the overall United States economy into contraction. In Williston, N.D., where the economy had been booming for years because of a surge in oil and natural gas drilling on the Bakken oil patch, businesses of all types closed or slashed wages. ""It varies week to week, but every week keeps getting worse,"" Marcus Jundt, owner of a restaurant, the Williston Brewing Company, told CNBC in March 2016. ""We don't know where the bottom is, but we're not there yet."" But it could have been worse. When Janet Yellen assumed leadership of the Federal Reserve in early 2014, she inherited an economy that had been expanding steadily for years, with a great deal of help from the Fed's interest rate policies. Deciding how and when to pull that support — when to raise interest rates, which had been near zero for more than six years — was set to be the defining choice of her tenure. In 2015, with signs that the United States economy was returning to health, she and her colleagues believed it was time to begin raising interest rates. She is a leading labor market scholar who spent a career studying, among other things, how a tight labor market can eventually feed through to inflation. In July of that year, with stirrings of the emerging markets disruption, the unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, not much above the level Fed officials believed was consistent with a fully healthy labor market. Then the turmoil of August began. Ms. Yellen elected not to raise rates in September, waiting for more evidence that the economy was truly on track and that the emerging market troubles wouldn't do too much damage to the domestic economy. But by December she judged that the situation had stabilized enough to raise rates. At the same time, the Fed revealed forecasts indicating that its senior officials expected to raise interest rates four more times in 2016. Within weeks, global markets were sending a message: Not so fast. The dollar kept strengthening, the price of commodities kept falling, and the Standard & Poor's 500 dropped about 9 percent over three weeks in late January and early February. Bond yields plummeted, suggesting that the United States was at risk of recession. In mid-February 2016, the financial leaders of the world's most powerful nations were set to convene in a Shanghai for the periodic G20 summit. With global markets in turmoil, the great question was: Can the officials rein in these forces? The official statement released by the participants in the summit contained multiple nods to the turbulence, acknowledging risks from ""volatile capital flows"" and falling commodity prices. But more important than any words was what followed in the following weeks. Two days after the summit, China lowered its reserve requirement on banks, essentially opening the spigot for more lending. In the months that followed, it would put in tighter controls on the movement of capital outside the country, and seek to tie the value of the yuan less closely to the dollar. Three weeks after the summit, the Fed had another policy meeting. Rather than raise interest rates further as had been envisioned in December, Fed officials declined to raise rates — and steeply reduced their expectations of how much further they would raise rates over the remainder of 2016. Together, these steps were enough to end the vicious cycle. The dollar stopped appreciating and started dropping. Oil prices bottomed out and began a recovery. In the United States, capital spending was growing again by the summer of 2016. Some analysts of financial markets have put a conspiratorial bent on the concerted action from the two sides of the Pacific, speculating that leaders had made a secret deal at the G20 meeting in February 2016. They call it the ""Shanghai Accord""— essentially, that the Fed would hold off on rate increases if the Chinese also took actions of their own. Ms. Yellen said it's not so. She said in an interview that there was an extensive exchange of views and information with the Chinese delegation in Shanghai, but that there were no promises or explicit agreements. ""I realize it looked to much of the world like some kind of secret handshake deal,"" she said. ""This wasn't a deal. This was the global economy and capital markets affecting the U.S. outlook, and the Fed being sensitive to that, taking that into account and its influencing policy appropriately."" The Fed, she said, did what it thought was best for the United States economy without knowing exactly what the Chinese would do. Mr. Sheets, the former Treasury official, also dismissed the idea of some secret agreement. ""It's just not how it works,"" he said. ""There were a lot of meetings. A lot of bilaterals and quadrilaterals. You meet with your counterparts and talk about the global economy and think about the challenges and what might be done. But there was nothing agreed behind closed doors that was not part of the formal statement."" Even if there was no formal secret agreement, the result — leaders of the world's two biggest economies squarely focused on the risks that the situation presented — turned out to be enough. The impact of the global commodity-currency spiral of 2015-16 is evident from a glance at the economic statistics. It is less so in the economic debates of 2018. First, while the Trump administration has claimed full credit for a surge in business investment, the bounce-back from the mini-recession is a major factor. White House economists have presented charts showing a surge starting in the fourth quarter of 2016, when the election took place. But that turnaround began in mid-2016 by most measures, not late 2016 as suggested by the White House's ""six quarter compound annual growth rate"" measure. Second, the mini-recession might well have affected some political attitudes during the 2016 election. While the economy was in pretty good shape for people in large cities on the coasts, 2016 was rough for a lot of people in local economies heavily reliant on drilling, mining, farming or making the machines that support those industries. A poll in October 2016 by an agriculture trade publication, Agri-Pulse, found that 86 percent of farmers were dissatisfied with the way things were going in the United States.  Third, economic policymakers need to display the flexibility to respond to incoming information, even when it doesn't fit their own forecasts or preconceptions. If Ms. Yellen had been more stubborn about sticking to the plan to keep raising rates through 2016 because of her training as a labor market economist, the result might well have been an actual recession. ""She's always learning,"" said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, ""and not so egotistical that she's wedded to one view of the world."" Finally, it shows the global economy is so interconnected that events in Shanghai or São Paulo can cause unpredictable effects in faraway places. In the last year, the Trump administration has been lobbing tariffs at China and other major economic partners to extract more advantageous terms for trade. But the mini-recession warns of the risk of ricochet. Like it or not, the complexity of our global connections means that policy can't just focus on the home front. In 2016, we learned that lesson the hard way, even if not everybody was paying attention."
News,2018-09-29,"DENVER — By nearly any measure, this city is booming. The unemployment rate is below 3 percent. There is so much construction that a local newspaper started a “crane watch” feature. Seemingly every week brings headlines about companies bringing high-paying jobs to the area.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/business/economy/home-prices-housing-market-slowdown.html,1814," DENVER — By nearly any measure, this city is booming. The unemployment rate is below 3 percent. There is so much construction that a local newspaper started a ""crane watch"" feature. Seemingly every week brings headlines about companies bringing high-paying jobs to the area. Yet, Denver's once-soaring housing market has run into turbulence. Sales and construction activity have slowed in recent months. Houses that would once have drawn a frenzy of offers are sitting on the market for days or weeks. Selling prices are rising more slowly, and asking prices are being slashed to attract buyers. Similar slowdowns have hit New York, Seattle and even San Francisco, cities that until recently ranked among the nation's hottest housing markets. The specifics vary, but economists, real estate agents and home builders say the core issue is the same: Home buyers are reaching a breaking point after years of breakneck price increases that far exceeded income gains. ""The local economy is still fantastic, all the fundamentals are there, but obviously wages are not keeping pace,"" said Steve Danyliw, a Denver realtor. ""As the market continues to move up, buyers are being pushed out."" Rachel Sandoval is one of them. An elementary schoolteacher in the Denver Public Schools, Ms. Sandoval earns about $50,000 a year, enough to afford a condominium or a modest house in most markets. But not in Denver, where the median sales price for all homes was $410,000 in August, and where even condos routinely top $300,000 — a price Ms. Sandoval calls ""not even close to feasible."" She said she was scoping out jobs in Texas, where houses are cheaper and pay is higher, and considering leaving teaching in search of a higher salary. For now, Ms. Sandoval, 41, is sharing a one-bathroom rental house with two roommates, a nurse and an adjunct professor. The three stick to a strict schedule to make sure they can all get to work on time. ""We are professionals, we have degrees,"" Ms. Sandoval said. ""This was not the plan."" Nationwide, sales of previously owned homes fell 1.5 percent in August from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Residential building permits were down 5.5 percent over the past year, according to the Department of Commerce. Many economists say the housing market may have turned into a drag on the gross domestic product. The recent slowdown, however, is unlikely to give would-be buyers like Ms. Sandoval much relief. Prices in Denver are still up 8 percent over the past year, according to the S&P Case-Shiller index. That's cool compared to the double-digit gains of a couple years ago, but well ahead of the 6 percent increase in average hourly earnings over the same period. Rising interest rates have also made buying homes more expensive. Few analysts expect an outright decline in home prices anytime soon. That's because, unlike the speculative bubble of the mid-2000s, the recent run-up in prices has been driven primarily by economic fundamentals: People are moving to Denver faster than developers can build places to live. The Denver region has added more than 300,000 residents since 2010, making it one of the country's fastest-growing areas. Introductory economics textbooks suggest that high prices should attract more supply or suppress demand — or both. Inventories of unsold homes have risen in Denver and other markets in recent months, and the real estate site Zillow found that price cuts have become more common. Over all, however, the housing market is not behaving as the textbooks say it should. Inventories remain low despite the recent increases, and new construction is slowing, not picking up. Part of the problem, local real estate agents say, is that the furious pace of price growth has essentially gummed up the market, making homeowners reluctant to sell for fear of being unable to find a new home. Rising interest rates are compounding the problem because would-be sellers do not want to give up their low interest rates, a phenomenon economists call the lock-in effect. Brant and Annie Wiedel spent more than a year trying to get a foothold in Denver's housing market — and they are reluctant to give it up. The couple estimate that they looked at 160 houses before finally closing on a three-bedroom ranch house in Lakewood, a suburb, three years ago. With two children and a third due in January, the Wiedels would like to trade up. With the rise in home prices some renovations, the house they bought for $350,000 could be worth more than $500,000. But the family borrowed at about 3.5 percent three years ago. Today, they would pay closer to 5 percent. ""Even if we just saw houses at the same price, we'd have to pay more"" every month, he said. Ultimately, the key to breaking the logjam is to build more homes. Downtown Denver is crawling with cranes, many of them erecting amenity-filled apartment complexes aimed at young professionals. A drive in almost any direction from downtown reveals freshly built subdivisions with names like Tallgrass, The Enclave and Green Gables Reserve. Most of those new homes, however, will list for more than $400,000. And hardly any builders are selling properties for under $300,000 without government subsidies. Even many home builders worry they are pricing themselves out of the market. ""I see the biggest threat to our business as the affordability challenge, that we are building houses that people can't afford,"" said Gene Myers, chief executive of Thrive Home Builders. The problem, Mr. Myers and other local builders say, is cost. The price of land, building permits and other fees can run close to $150,000 for a single-family lot — before construction. Some of the challenges are specific to Colorado. Quirks in state law, for example, make it easy for condominium buyers to collectively sue builders over construction defects, making developers reluctant to build condos. But other issues are common to many cities. Building materials have become more expensive, in part because of tariffs on lumber and other products that President Trump imposed this year. Labor costs are rising, too, especially for skilled trade workers. Restrictive zoning makes it hard to build denser developments that make cheaper homes profitable for builders. ""They're producing what they can produce,"" said Sam Khater, chief economist for Freddie Mac, the government housing-finance company. ""The problem is, it's uneconomic for them to produce affordable."" This big-city conundrum is spreading. People priced out of San Francisco moved to Seattle and Portland, driving up prices and displacing people who moved to Denver and Austin. Next on the list: Boise, Nashville and other cities offering some of the same attractions at lower prices. Sure enough, the online real estate site Redfin this spring found that Denver had joined Seattle and San Francisco as cities with a ""net outflow"" of users — that is, there were more people on the site looking to leave Denver than to move there. ""City after city is going to face this,"" said Glenn Kelman, Redfin's chief executive. ""At some point, the buyers step back and say, 'Enough is enough.'"" More people are moving to Denver than leaving it, but migration has tapered off in recent years. J. J. Ament, chief executive of Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, said he had seen no sign that rising home prices were making the region less attractive. Last month, VF Corporation, an apparel maker that owns brands like The North Face and Vans, announced it would move its headquarters to Denver from North Carolina, partly because of the area's reputation for outdoor activities. The state also offered $27 million in incentives. ""I wouldn't use the word 'crisis,'"" Mr. Ament said. ""The work force is still willing to move here."" Plenty of people in Denver do use the word ""crisis,"" however. A January report from Shift Research Lab, a local research group, concluded that years of under-building have left the region with a shortfall of tens of thousands of housing units. That shortfall could threaten Denver's growth, said Phyllis Resnick, a Colorado State University economist and one of the report's authors. The skilled workers moving to the area, who have been so important to attracting companies and jobs, want to be able to eat out at restaurants, drop off their dry cleaning and send their children to school, all of which require lower and middle income workers. If they cannot afford to live in the area, Ms. Resnick said, Denver will not retain its allure — and the economy will not keep growing. ""My concern is, at some point it sort of breaks because we can't house the folks that we need to fill out all the economic activity in the region,"" she said. ""I'm not convinced that in the near term it will correct itself just through market forces, unless that's through people moving out."" Local governments and charities are trying to address the problem. The Denver City Council last month voted to double, to $30 million per year, the city's affordable housing fund, which is used to build and preserve homes for low-income residents. Late last year, nonprofit groups announced they had raised $24 million to start the Elevation Community Land Trust, which will buy land to create permanently affordable housing. Another new program aims to help public schoolteachers come up with down payments. To have a big impact, economists say Denver and other cities have to build more homes affordable to middle-class families. That will require persuading communities accustomed to single-family homes to accept condos and townhomes. ""The only way to solve the riddle is through density,"" said Dave Lemnah, co-owner of Lokal Homes, a Denver builder. That's why he is building projects like the Villas at Wheatlands, a 94-unit development in Aurora, east of Denver. Each lot has three attached units arranged like a jigsaw puzzle. Lokal sells the homes for less than $400,000; some go for close to $300,000. One buyer, Angela Kirkland-Vandecar, an aesthetician and a single mother, has spent two years searching for a home she could afford on her roughly $50,000 income. When Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar began her search, she did not want to move to Aurora or to a condo. ""I've now done everything that in the beginning I said I was not going to do,"" she said. But Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar feels good about her decision. Her monthly mortgage payment will be less than her $1,900 monthly rent, and she is happy not to have a lawn to mow. Her daughters, 11 and 13, will have their own rooms, and she will no longer have to store food in the laundry room, as she did in the cramped apartment she had been renting. Walking through her nearly ready house recently, looking for defects, Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar opened a door in the kitchen and paused. A Lokal Homes worker asked if she had found a problem. She shook her head. ""I'm just enjoying my pantry,"" she said."
News Analysis,2018-09-29,"When Mike Fleiss, the creator of “The Bachelor” and “Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?” helped pioneer reality television in the early 2000s, he quickly realized that for any show to work, the audience needed to feel invested. “Whenever you’re developing one of these shows, you have to find stakes — true love or a million dollars,” Mr. Fleiss said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/sunday-review/trump-2020-reality-tv.html,1179," When Mike Fleiss, the creator of ""The Bachelor"" and ""Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?"" helped pioneer reality television in the early 2000s, he quickly realized that for any show to work, the audience needed to feel invested. ""Whenever you're developing one of these shows, you have to find stakes — true love or a million dollars,"" Mr. Fleiss said. These days, Mr. Fleiss does what American TV viewers are doing in record numbers — he sits glued to cable news, watching a panel of experts discuss the latest developments in the sprawling, intricate, unpredictable 24/7 show that is Donald Trump's presidency. ""This is the future of the world and the safety of mankind and the health of the planet,"" Mr. Fleiss told me. He paused. ""I should've thought of that one."" Mr. Fleiss and other TV producers have watched — equal parts entranced and horrified — as Mr. Trump has taken the gimmicks of reality TV that he picked up on ""The Apprentice"" and applied them to daily governance. Flip comparisons of Mr. Trump's White House and his years on ""The Apprentice"" abound, but behind the ""You're fired!"" jokes is a serious case study in mass viewing habits and a president who has made up for his lack of experience in governing with an uncanny grasp of must-see TV. Mr. Fleiss used to joke that at the end of every episode of ""The Bachelor,"" the host should tease the Champagne-fueled finale as ""The most shocking rose ceremony ever!"" On Tuesday, there was Mr. Trump at the United Nations General Assembly, making a roomful of staid diplomats chuckle with the line ""In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country."" (Another favorite: ""The likes of which this country may never have seen before!"") Mr. Trump concludes each episode with a cliffhanger. After a week of teasing a constitutional crisis right after the commercial break, Mr. Trump didn't end up firing (or even meeting with) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, leaving us hanging with a potential meeting set for next week. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Trump used his go-to ""We'll see what happens"" 11 times, according to a Politico tally. At a time when the big-tent TV show seems all but dead and niche shows proliferate (""Marvelous Mrs. Mais-who?"" groaned many Emmy viewers), Mr. Trump has created an unscripted drama that has unified living rooms everywhere. Whether you're rooting for the antihero or cheering for his demise, chances are Trump TV has you under steady — some would say unhealthy — hypnosis. Now, with more than half the country ready to hurl the remote, and the midterm elections presenting the first real opportunity to rewrite the script, the question remains: Why can't we stop watching? Even in the so-called golden age of TV, Mr. Trump hasn't just dominated water-cooler conversation; he's sucked the water right out, making all other entertainment from N.F.L. games to awards shows pale in comparison. ""The Russia probe, Kavanaugh, Avenatti, Rosenstein, Cohen, Flynn, Papadopoulos — we're a wildly creative community, but this is peak TV,"" said Warren Littlefield, who oversaw NBC Entertainment in the era of ""Friends"" and ""The West Wing."" (He says ""The Apprentice,"" a ratings juggernaut, killed quality scripted TV in 2004, when it got the coveted 9 p.m. slot on Thursdays, a move made by his successor, Jeff Zucker, now president of CNN.) Some TV executives say the only way for the Trump show to get canceled is for ratings to fall off — forcing the president to fade into obscurity or an awkward fox trot in a ""Dancing With the Stars"" spray tan. But TV history shows that the most successful series — ""American Idol,"" ""Lost,"" ""The West Wing"" and, yes, ""The Apprentice"" — don't see sharp declines in viewership or talk of cancellation until around Season 6.  By that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely. (In what would no doubt be ""The most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"") As of now, there are no signs of viewer fatigue. Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC. Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" has topped cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights. ""This is a fire that people are being drawn to because it's not something we understand,"" said Neal Baer, show runner of the ABC drama ""Designated Survivor,"" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol. Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of ""Just the Funny Parts: … And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club,"" has another theory. She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election. The driver told her he would be voting for Mr. Trump. Why? she asked. ""He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'"" Ms. Scovell told me. ""There is entertainment value in the chaos."" Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy. Tuning out is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford. And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself on hour six of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of ""deep background"" sourcing for his book ""Fear,"" Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket (""a garment thick with hubris,"" The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy. (I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.) ""Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he is feeding you something every night,"" said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of ""Pawn Stars,"" about the Trump show's rotating cast and daily plot twists (picking a fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un). ""You can't afford to miss one episode or you're left behind."" When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN. He couldn't peel himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance. ""I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back in the day and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'"" Mr. Fleiss told me.

",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/opinion/sunday/childhood-cancer.html,738," Like most of the boys in his San Salvador neighborhood, Gabriel Alessandro Mayorga Hernandez — Gabo, to his family and friends — loves soccer. But in 2014, just before he turned 12, he found himself exhausted by even a short game. Eventually he became too tired to play at all and started having headaches so severe they made him vomit. When he developed chest pains and difficulty breathing, his grandmother took him to the doctor, where X-rays and blood work indicated that he had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or A.L.L., a blood cancer that develops most often in young children.  A decade ago, that might have been the end of Gabo's story. While high-income countries like the United States have made tremendous strides against A.L.L. and a string of similar childhood cancers, those gains have not trickled down to low- and middle-income countries, many of which simply don't have the resources to treat complex diseases. In such places, the blood and fever of leukemia are often mistaken for malaria. And even when doctors do diagnose the disease properly, chemotherapy and radiation are in short supply, and bone marrow transplants nearly nonexistent. The result of those deficits is not surprising, but it is striking. In rich countries, 80 percent of children with diseases like A.L.L. survive. In many poor countries, 80 percent die. That inversion marks one of the greatest health disparities in the world, according to the World Health Organization, which convened a meeting at the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the issue on Friday. ""With childhood leukemia, the single biggest predictor of whether you recover or not is where you happen to have been born,"" says Dr. Carlos Rodriguez-Galindo, executive vice president of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and chairman of its global pediatric medicine department. ""We're talking about many thousands of young children dying every single year of diseases that we have known how to cure for decades."" In El Salvador, Dr. Rodriguez-Galindo and his colleagues have managed to upend that calculus by forging a partnership with the nation's government and its nonprofit sector that has enabled them to pass on the tools of their trade. As a result, El Salvador has had unusual success for a low-income nation: The survival rate for childhood cancers there has increased dramatically, from 5 percent in 1993 to 48 percent today. By the time Gabo got sick in 2014, doctors in San Salvador knew how to diagnose A.L.L., and pediatric oncologists were available to treat it. He received specialized care similar to what he'd get in any high-income country. And he went into remission a month after his diagnosis. This week, St. Jude announced a five-year, $15 million partnership with the World Health Organization, aimed at expanding on that success. The hospital's goal is to cure at least 60 percent of children around the world with the six most common types of cancer, including A.L.L., by 2030, using tools that have long been commonplace in wealthier countries: training and basic equipment for doctors, access to chemotherapy drugs and other technology, and support and follow-up care for patients. The collaboration marks a welcome opening of institutional borders. The W.H.O. rarely teams up with outside nonprofits, despite the obvious benefits of doing so: St. Jude has extensive specialized knowledge that is clearly lifesaving when shared; the W.H.O. has decades of experience working in countries marred by sweeping poverty and enduring violence. Together, they are well equipped to finally close this inexcusable survival gap. But their success will hinge on several other entities. Individual governments need to prioritize noncommunicable diseases like cancer, and work harder to provide universal health coverage; the drug and device industries need to come to the table on pricing — the technology of cancer care is expensive, but it can be made affordable. And wealthier countries need to contribute resources of their own to the effort. Such investments can only strengthen the global economy in the long run: The W.H.O. estimates that every dollar invested in tackling these noncommunicable diseases will generate a $7 return by 2030. If world leaders can recognize that benefit, hundreds of thousands of children around the world may finally have the same chance as Gabo, who received a standing ovation when he addressed the United Nations on Friday. He has long since returned to playing soccer. This fall, he started high school. And he has his whole life ahead of him.

During her second week there, a house guest arrived to visit family and he and Ms. Jow eventually struck up a conversation. When she told him she had broken up with a musician in London, he quickly brought up another musician, his friend Wade Michael, who had just moved to Brooklyn from his native Wisconsin after the breakup of his rock band, American Standard. Mr. Michael, he said, had previously lived in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and had come to New York a bit dazed and confused, hoping to give his music ""one last try.""

""She was very striking with beautiful blonde hair,"" Mr. Michael said. ""Just the way she talked, and the things she talked about, like the world she was a part of in London, those were things that growing up in the Midwest I was very interested in, but never fully understood."" They began spending time together and became an item in March 2012, after a heart-to-heart talk at a Brooklyn bar where Ms. Jow discussed the emotional pain of her breakup in London.

Soon, Sindiso Magaqa was clapping and bouncing behind the wheel of his beloved V8 Mercedes-Benz, pulling into familiar territory just before dark. Minutes later, men closed in with assault rifles. Mr. Magaqa reached for the gun under his seat — too late. One of his passengers saw flashes of light, dozens of them, from the spray of bullets pockmarking the doors. The ambush was exactly what Mr. Magaqa had feared. A few months before, a friend had been killed by gunmen in his front yard. Then, as another friend tried to open his front gate at night, a hit man crept out of the dark, shooting him dead. Next came Mr. Magaqa, 34. Struck half a dozen times, he hung on for weeks in a hospital before dying last year. All of the assassination targets had one thing in common: They were members of the African National Congress who had spoken out against corruption in the party that defined their lives. ""If you understand the Cosa Nostra, you don't only kill the person, but you also send a strong message,"" said Thabiso Zulu, another A.N.C. whistle-blower who, fearing for his life, is now in hiding. ""We broke the rule of omertà,"" he added, saying that the party of Nelson Mandela had become like the Mafia. Political assassinations are rising sharply in South Africa, threatening the stability of hard-hit parts of the country and imperiling Mr. Mandela's dream of a unified, democratic nation. But unlike much of the political violence that upended the country in the 1990s, the recent killings are not being driven by vicious battles between rival political parties. Quite the opposite: In most cases, A.N.C. officials are killing one another, hiring professional hit men to eliminate fellow party members in an all-or-nothing fight over money, turf and power, A.N.C. officials say. The party once inspired generations of South Africans and captured the imagination of millions around the world — from impoverished corners of Africa to wealthy American campuses. But corruption and divisions have flourished within the A.N.C. in recent years, stripping much of the party of its ideals. After nearly 25 years in power, party members have increasingly turned to fighting, not over competing visions for the nation, but over influential positions and the spoils that go with them. The death toll is climbing quickly. About 90 politicians have been killed since the start of 2016, more than twice the annual rate in the 16 years before that, according to researchers at the University of Cape Town and the Global Initiative Against Transnational Crime. The murders have swelled into such a national crisis that the police began releasing data on political killings for the first time this year, while the new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has lamented that the assassinations are tarnishing Mr. Mandela's dream. But Mr. Ramaphosa is struggling to unite his fractious party before elections next year and has done little to stem the violence. His administration has even resisted official demands to provide police protection for two A.N.C. whistle-blowers in the case surrounding Mr. Magaqa's murder, baffling some anticorruption officials. The recent assassinations cover a wide range of personal and political feuds. Some victims were A.N.C. officials who became targets after exposing or denouncing corruption within the party. Others fell in internal battles for lucrative posts. In rural areas — where the party has a near-total grip on the economy, jobs and government contracts — the conflict is particularly intense, with officials constantly looking over their shoulders. Mr. Magaqa's province, KwaZulu-Natal, is the deadliest of all. Here, 80 A.N.C. officials were killed between 2011 and 2017, the party says. Even relatively low-level ward councilors have bodyguards, and many politicians carry guns themselves. ""It was better before we attained democracy, because we knew the enemy — that the enemy was the regime, the unjust regime,"" said Mluleki Ndobe, the mayor of the district where Mr. Magaqa and five other A.N.C. politicians have been assassinated in the past year. ""Now, you don't know who is the enemy,"" he said. More than any other, the death of Mr. Magaqa, the most prominent politician assassinated so far, has focused attention on the deadly scramble within the party that helped bring democracy to South Africa. A rising star in the A.N.C. who had become a national figure, Mr. Magaqa returned to local politics in his hometown, Umzimkhulu. After accusing party officials of pocketing millions in the failed refurbishment of a historic building, Mr. Magaqa and two of his allies were killed in rapid succession. Many others have suffered similar fates. This month in Pretoria, the capital, an A.N.C. councilor who had called for an inquiry into government housing was gunned down while driving her car with her three children. A few months earlier, a party official in a neighboring ward was shot dead near his home after exposing the shoddy quality of public housing. In Mpumalanga, the province of Deputy President David Mabuza, an A.N.C. city council speaker was gunned down in front of his son outside his home after exposing corruption in the construction of a soccer stadium. Here in KwaZulu-Natal, an A.N.C. councilor critical of corruption was shot to death last year while escorting a friend to her car. In March, an A.N.C. municipal manager known to be tough on corruption was gunned down behind a police station by two hit men. And this month, in a rare arrest, an A.N.C. councilor and the son of an A.N.C. deputy mayor were charged in the killing of an A.N.C. official who had led protests against corruption. But few other political figures have been arrested in such killings, adding to a widening sense of lawlessness. ""The politicians have become like a political mafia,"" said Mary de Haas, an expert on political killings who taught at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. ""It is the very antithesis of democracy, because people fear to speak out."" For good reason. After Mr. Magaqa's death, Mr. Zulu, the whistle-blower now in hiding, loudly condemned corruption in Umzimkhulu. The impoverished municipal government spent a large chunk of its budget to refurbish a historic building called the Memorial Hall. But after five years and more than $2 million in public money, the project was a sinkhole of dubious spending, with little to show for it. For breaking the code of silence, Mr. Zulu and another party official are now in grave danger, according to a 47-page report released in August by the Office of the Public Protector, a government authority that investigates corruption. The two whistle-blowers, the report said, fear that ""they may be assassinated at any time."" The Public Protector's office urged the national police to provide security for the whistle-blowers and reprimanded Mr. Ramaphosa's police minister for being ""grossly negligent"" in failing to do so. But the police minister rejected the report and moved to challenge it in court. The Public Protector had a message for Mr. Ramaphosa as well: The president should ""take urgent and appropriate steps"" to protect the whistle-blowers. But Mr. Ramaphosa has not responded. Khusela Diko, his spokeswoman, said the president is consulting his police minister. The government's inaction reflects the A.N.C.'s inability — or unwillingness — to stop the internal warfare because it could expose the extent of corruption and criminality in its ranks, current and former party officials say. ""These allegiances go all the way to the top of the party,"" said Makhosi Khoza, a prominent former A.N.C. politician who works at OUTA, an organization fighting graft. ""That's why the A.N.C. is not interested in this, no matter how many murders there are."" For decades before the end of apartheid, different factions under the A.N.C.'s umbrella — communists, free marketeers, trade unionists, agents in exile — competed with one another, sometimes violently, as they fought white rule. But the recent increase in killings inside the A.N.C. is a potent reminder of how far the party has strayed from creating, in the ashes of apartheid, a political order based on the rule of law. The Public Protector's investigation into the Memorial Hall has frozen the renovation. Umzimkhulu's mayor, Mphuthumi Mpabanga, called the project a ""dream"" that would change ""the lives of the people."" But it has little resonance for many in Umzimkhulu, a vast municipality with pockets of extreme poverty. Margaret Phungula, 60, carries buckets to a muddy stream six times a day for water, adding spoonfuls of chlorine. Shown a photo of the Memorial Hall, she stared blankly. ""They're not thinking of us,"" she said of the town's leaders. ""We're still suffering."" In the arc of the A.N.C., Mr. Magaqa and his friends belong to the generation that includes Mr. Mandela's grandchildren. Too young to have been politically active during white rule, they came of age in a new country — one forged by the party. Their political lives, mirroring the A.N.C.'s post-apartheid trajectory, began with youthful idealism, followed by lost innocence and, ultimately, fratricidal violence. Mr. Zulu, 36, the whistle-blower, always wanted to be an A.N.C. man. His grandmother took part in the A.N.C.-led potato boycott against apartheid in the 1950s, and he felt part of that legacy. In his late teens, he fell in with a group of politically minded young men like himself. One of them stood out immediately: Mr. Magaqa, a skinny, stubborn teenager with a bright smile. The youngest in the group, he quickly became its leader. Mr. Magaqa made a name for himself by leading a strike during high school. When students contributed money for a trip to Cape Town, the principal told them it had been put to other uses. Mr. Magaqa shut down the school for weeks. The early 2000s were a hopeful time for the young men. Their elders in the A.N.C. had gained political freedom for black South Africans, so the young men turned their attention to breaking into an economy still dominated by the white minority. Les Stuta — the second A.N.C. whistle-blower whose life is in danger, according to the Public Protector — was in the group as well. He recounted how they pledged to earn money to help their mothers, who worked as live-in maids for white families far away. ""Guys,"" Mr. Stuta recalled saying often, ""they must come back home."" The young men traveled together across the vast stretches of the rural district to open youth league branches of the A.N.C., borrowing cars or hitchhiking. Finally, in 2004, Mr. Stuta got a car — a beat-up white Ford Escort with a sputtering 1.3-liter engine. The young men stocked it with oil and water to deal with frequent breakdowns along the dirt and gravel roads to remote villages. When Mr. Stuta could not afford to replace the starter for six months, party meetings ended with the young men pushing the car back to life. ""That Ford Escort,"" Mr. Stuta said, ""was everything to us."" By 2006, Mr. Magaqa and his circle got well-paid government jobs in Umzimkhulu. He got a car of his own, with a vanity plate: ""Gogwana,"" the grandmother who had raised him while his mother worked in Johannesburg. When the A.N.C.'s youth league was established in Umzimkhulu, Mr. Magaqa became the chairman, beginning his rapid rise within the league — traditionally a springboard to leadership in the A.N.C. itself. But something nagged Mr. Zulu. Within a few years, the overriding pursuit of positions and money consumed his peers. Suddenly, some were taking kickbacks, drinking rare whiskeys and prodding Mr. Zulu to drop his high-mindedness. Flipping Jesus's teaching, they often asked him: Who can live on principle alone? Soon, Mr. Zulu lost his government job and devoted himself to fighting corruption. But life was very different for his friend. At 27, Mr. Magaqa left the province for the national stage in Johannesburg. He became the A.N.C. youth league's national secretary general, the No. 3 position, in 2011. As soon as he was appointed, he went to a car dealership in a wealthy Johannesburg suburb where he bought an icon of South Africa's moneyed class: a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle, the ML 500 4Matic. Mr. Magaqa raved about it to his friends back home — its V8 engine, the thunderous noise from the twin exhaust pipes. ""He felt like he's got money,"" recalled Phumlani Phumlomo, a childhood friend. How much money Mr. Magaqa made in Johannesburg — and how — were questions Mr. Zulu preferred not to ask. ""I don't know how he acquired his money,"" Mr. Zulu said. ""Remember, he had access to everyone and anyone who's big in the country."" It only lasted a few months. Mr. Magaqa fell in one of the countless shake-ups within the A.N.C. and lost his position. He drove his Mercedes straight back to Umzimkhulu and put most of his money into a minor league soccer team, the Blue Birds. He recruited the best players, lodging them in a big house with cable and PlayStations. When his team won on the road — and it won a lot — he put up the players and coach in a hotel. ""But then his cash ran out,"" said the coach, Mduduzi Ngubane. With his money gone, Mr. Magaqa went back to what he knew best: politics. In his political second act, Mr. Magaqa dove headlong into the issue that defined the A.N.C.: corruption. Jacob Zuma, the party's scandal-plagued leader, was president of the nation, and more than ever, local A.N.C. politicians began killing one another over positions, contracts and jobs. In 2016, when Mr. Magaqa returned to politics, 31 politicians were assassinated, double the number from the year before, according to the tally by researchers. Of that total, 24 were killed in his province. With the backing of regional A.N.C. power brokers, Mr. Magaqa became a councilor in Umzimkhulu and a member of its decision-making body, effectively becoming the leader of an insurgent A.N.C. faction. The sudden return of a political star, someone who could still call on powerful figures in Johannesburg, was seen as an immediate threat to his party rivals in Umzimkhulu. ""He was too ambitious,"" said the municipal manager, Zweliphansi Skhosana. ""That was the problem that he had."" Mr. Skhosana, a former high school teacher, knew Mr. Magaqa all too well. He had taught the young man from 10th grade through 12th grade. The two stood on opposing sides during the strike over money for the Cape Town trip. Now they were facing off again. Regarded as the real power behind Umzimkhulu's dominant A.N.C. faction, Mr. Skhosana still lived next to the old high school, in the area's largest house, surrounded by a concrete wall and electrified barbed wire. Right after joining the council, Mr. Magaqa zeroed in on the troubled renovation of the Memorial Hall. Little had been done to it, and the construction of a new annex was proving to be a disaster. A few councilors had already raised concerns, calling it a classic public works boondoggle designed to siphon money into the pockets of politicians and their allies. Jabulile Msiya, a councilor whose ward included the hall, said she had been excluded from meetings on the project after asking too many questions. Experts unconnected to Umzimkhulu's politics, like Robert Brusse, an architect specializing in heritage buildings, agreed something was wrong. A few weeks after being hired as a consultant for the project in 2016, Mr. Brusse went to see the Memorial Hall for himself. ""As I walked onto the site, I said, 'There's a rat here. This stinks,""' he recalled. The new building behind the Memorial Hall was ""professionally incompetent"" and a ""complete waste of money for what is being produced,"" he said. Mr. Magaqa and his council allies demanded an independent audit — a motion quashed by the A.N.C.'s dominant faction in the municipality. Mr. Skhosana, the municipal manager, dismissed any possibility of corruption. Mr. Magaqa, he said, was simply trying to stir up trouble to gain control over the local government. He waved away accusations by councilors that the contractor had been chosen because of personal connections to a local official. The contractor simply had a ""cash flow"" problem, he said. But the contractor, Loyiso Magqaza, contradicted him in a telephone interview, denying any cash flow issues. ""They can never"" blame me for the project's failure, he said. Mr. Magaqa, stuck in a deadlock with his former teacher, turned to someone his allies said he trusted fully: his old friend, Mr. Zulu. Mr. Zulu had become a known corruption fighter in the province, gathering evidence and sharing it with officials he trusted. So Mr. Magaqa gave him what he described as official documents about the Memorial Hall. The documents, which were reviewed by The New York Times, showed that after the contractor won the renovation contract in 2013, worth $1.2 million, the municipality paid the company and its subcontractor nearly two-thirds of the money, even though the project was far behind schedule. Two years later, after the company and its subcontractor failed to finish, the municipality hired a different contractor for another $1 million. In all, the documents do not unequivocally prove corruption on their own, but they show the municipality spent nearly all of the money it had budgeted for the hall — and ended up with little to show for it. Mr. Zulu said he had grabbed the files and promised to pursue the case with his contacts in the police. But over the following months, Mr. Magaqa brandished the documents in the council and challenged leaders of the dominant A.N.C. faction, leading Mr. Zulu to wonder whether his old friend was also trying to use the issue to his personal political advantage. The council speaker appeared to be moving over to Mr. Magaqa's side, according to the speaker's nephew, Mduduzi Thobela, an old friend who backed Mr. Magaqa during the high school strike. The speaker and Mr. Magaqa had been friendly, and were even related through marriage. Then the killings started. First came the warning: Three bullets pierced the storefront office where the council speaker worked. A few weeks later, the speaker, Khaya Thobela, was sprinkling holy water in a religious rite in his front yard — and was gunned down where he stood. A month later, the councilor expected to replace him, Mduduzi Shibase, was assassinated after opening the gate to his home. He had strongly supported Mr. Magaqa's call for a forensic audit of the Memorial Hall. Ms. Msiya, the councilor who had asked pointed questions about the project, got a worried call from Mr. Magaqa. ""'Where are you? Don't go out. I'm coming,'"" she recalled him saying. He showed her a ""hit list"" he got from a friend in a government intelligence agency, she said. ""'It's going to be me,'"" Mr. Magaqa told her. ""'After me, it's you.'"" On July 13, 2017, a red BMW cased the neighborhood where Mr. Magaqa lived. His neighbors did not recognize the car. It had a license plate from Gauteng, the province where Johannesburg is. Mr. Magaqa, accompanied by Ms. Msiya and other allies, had spent the day in a far corner of Umzimkhulu. But he was in a rush to head back home. The twin killings had shaken him, it was late afternoon, in the dead of South Africa's winter, and the sun would be setting in no time. ""'Let's go, we're not safe,""' he said, recalled Nontsikelelo Mafa, a councilor and close ally. As always, Mr. Magaqa drove his Mercedes himself and hid his gun under the driver's seat. His bodyguard and another A.N.C. politician in the car also carried guns. Talk of the killings soon gave way to more pleasant topics during the 45-mile drive. The car stereo played house music, blasting the Distruction Boyz's ""Omunye,"" an instant hit about a party. The group was planning a party that evening, too, for Ms. Mafa's 27th birthday. By the time they got back, the music had Mr. Magaqa jumping in his seat. They pulled over at a hangout by the main road, where the red BMW had been waiting. Mr. Magaqa spotted the hit men first. ""Don't move,"" he told the passengers in the back seat. Ms. Mafa saw two men with assault rifles approaching and Mr. Magaqa reaching for his gun. Then, the flashes of light. Mr. Zulu's cellphone rang minutes after the shooting. He reached out to senior police officials he trusted. ""The first one hour is decisive,"" he said. But the hit men weren't caught, even though they drove a conspicuous car and had left witnesses: two women in the back seat survived with wounds to their legs. Mr. Magaqa died about eight weeks later — from his injuries, the authorities said. His family insisted he had been recovering and was poisoned. Of the nearly 40 politicians assassinated in South Africa last year, he was the most recognizable. The public broadcaster aired his funeral, five and a half hours long, live from a sports field. Hundreds came, including top A.N.C. politicians and a minister who flew in by helicopter. The speeches were anodyne, or became rallying cries for the party. But Mr. Zulu had none of it. At a service beforehand, he said Mr. Magaqa had been killed for revealing corruption inside the party. Today, fearing for his own life, Mr. Zulu sleeps in a different place every night. Two bodyguards, hired by his extended family, shadow him at all times. The three big men squeeze into his compact Volkswagen, which sinks a few inches every time they get in, as Mr. Zulu wages his one-man crusade against corruption. ""The A.N.C. is like an ocean that will cleanse itself,"" he said, repeating it so often that he seemed to be trying to convince himself. He, too, says he is fighting for what President Ramaphosa calls a ""new dawn"" for the nation. So why, he asked, has Mr. Ramaphosa remained silent on the Public Protector's recommendations to provide him with security? ""I've been living like a hunted animal,"" Mr. Zulu said. In an empty, roofless room, wrapped in heavy blankets against the cold, Mr. Magaqa's mother spoke about the promises A.N.C. officials made after her son died. His Mercedes sat in a corner of the backyard, riddled with bullets. She was still waiting for the A.N.C. to solve the killing, to take care of her son's four children, or even to fix his broken cars. ""Especially the Mercedes,"" she said. ""It's destroyed our family, especially me. Each and every day, I see it, and everything comes back."""

In honor of the anniversary, there have been approximately 1,000,000,000 pieces reflecting on the 2008 financial crisis and its effects. Many have suggested, rightly, that the political fallout continues to shape our world today. But as far as I can tell, surprisingly few have focused on the long-run economic effects. What's odd about this relative neglect is that even a cursory look at the data suggests that these effects were huge. It's true that U.S. unemployment is back below what it was before the crisis; although it's not widely realized, euro area unemployment is also way down, not quite to eve-of-crisis levels but well below its pre-crisis average. But in both cases we've returned to sort-of full employment at a much lower level of real GDP than informed people projected we'd reach before the crisis struck. I am, of course, not the first or only person to make this observation. Antonio Fatás and Larry Summers have been banging on this drum for years, as has Larry Ball. But it seems worth pointing out to a (slightly, maybe) larger audience the sheer extent to which the future is not what it used to be, speculating a bit about why and how that may have happened, and talking about its implications for future policy. 1. From the Great Recession to the Great Shortfall Economists use the term ""potential output"" to refer to the maximum amount an economy can produce without inflationary overheating. This concept plays a central role in monetary policy, and some role in fiscal policy too. As I'll explain in a bit, the theoretical underpinnings of the concept look weaker now, in the light of post-crisis experience, than they used to. But for now, let's just note that a number of agencies, from the U.S. Congressional Budget Office to the International Monetary Fund, routinely produce estimates of current potential output and projections of future potential output. To be clear, these are model-based estimates, not actual data. And one possible story is that the models are all wrong, that we're looking at a construct that has nothing to do with reality. But as I said, these models matter for policy. So what do we find if we compare pre-crisis projections of potential output over the decade ahead to current estimates? The answer is, a huge downgrading of estimates of economic capacity on both sides of the Atlantic. Figure 1 compares CBO's 10-year projection of potential U.S. real GDP as of January 2008 with what it now thinks happened. The downgrading of the estimate is huge – more than 11 percent as of 2018. One way to say this is that the U.S. economy is as far below pre-crisis expectations now as it was in the depths of the Great Recession, even though we have supposedly recovered from the crisis. Figure 2 shows comparable estimates for the euro area, from Fatás. We see a similar downgrading of prospects, but even bigger. This massive decline in GDP from what we used to expect, a full decade after the financial crisis, is a huge story – call it the Great Shortfall — that gets overlooked in the usual focus on short-term growth rates. What might explain it? 2. Three stories about the shortfall: happenstance, hypochondria, and hysteresis One possible story about the way the Great Shortfall followed the Great Recession is that post hoc wasn't propter hoc: the economy's potential is far less than people expected it to be a decade ago, but the reasons for the downward bend in the long-run growth curve have little to do with the financial crisis – they just happened to kick in roughly at the same time. That is, the roots of the growth slowdown lie in things like technological disappointment (there's a new iPhone; who cares?) and social change leading to a lower share of the population participating in labor markets (opioids or video games, take your pick) that would have happened even if there had been no Great Recession. This story is in effect, though not explicitly, the narrative underlying actual economic policy: the Fed and other central banks, which are the real actors in macroeconomic policy under current conditions, don't act as if they're very worried that a future recession might depress the economy not just in the short run but permanently. Fiscal authorities, to the extent that they think coherently about these issues at all – i.e., outside the current U.S. administration – also take the path of future economic potential mostly as a given. To be fair, CBO's projections try to take the incentive effects of tax policy and the effects of deficits on investment into account, but these are small change compared with what you would need to link the Great Recession to the massive downgrading of long-run growth projections. What's the evidence against this view? The most compelling evidence, cited by both Fatás/Summers and Ball, is that the size of the Great Shortfall varies a lot between countries – and the countries whose estimated economic potential has taken the biggest hit are precisely the countries that had the biggest slumps in the economic crisis. Indeed, the relationship between output decline in the crisis and the fall in long-run potential GDP is pretty much one-for-one. Figure 3 shows the most extreme case, Greece, comparing actual and potential GDP as estimated by the IMF. As everyone knows, Greece has suffered a huge, Depression-level slump. According to the IMF, however, around half that slump is a decline in capacity rather than reduced utilization of capacity. And even this understates the change in projections, because it's not just the future that isn't what it used to be, but the past. In Figure 3, Greece is shown as having had a drastically overheated economy, operating far above sustainable levels, in 2007 and 2008. But few people said that at the time. In fact, the IMF's own estimate as of early 2008 was that in 2007 Greece was operating only 2.5 percent above potential, compared with its current estimate of 10.7 percent for the same year. What's going on? The IMF's method for calculating potential GDP basically reads any sustained slump as a decline in potential output relative to previous expectations, and this interpretation of decline affects both its projections of the future and its interpretation of the past: if it concludes that potential output in 2010 was really low, the IMF marks down its estimates of potential in previous years too. Which brings me to a second possible explanation of the Great Shortfall: maybe it exists only in the minds and models of policymakers (or, actually, their technical experts), and isn't a real thing at all. That is, the belief that our economic potential has fallen far below previous expectations doesn't represent an actual economic ailment, but instead reflects policymakers' hypochondria. After all, how is potential output calculated? The details are complex, but basically such calculations rely on one or both of two theories: that slumps and booms are always short-lived, and/or that inflation is an ""accelerationist"" process. Suppose, first, that you start from the assumption that deviations of actual GDP from potential GDP tend to be eliminated over the course of a few years at most, with the economy surging after slumps and stagnating or shrinking after booms. In that case, you believe that the average difference between actual and potential GDP will be roughly zero over any extended period, which means that you can get an estimate of potential GDP by taking actual GDP and applying some kind of statistical method that smooths out the fluctuations. Suppose, alternatively, that you believe – as most mainstream economists did not long ago – in some version of Milton Friedman's ""natural rate"" hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, an economy running above potential output will experience not just inflation but accelerating inflation, while an economy with persistent slack will experience ongoing disinflation, with the inflation rate falling continuously and eventually turning into accelerating deflation. If this hypothesis is true, you can in effect infer where we are relative to potential by asking what's happening to inflation: if it's stable, the economy is producing roughly at potential. In the light of post-2008 experience, however, it's clear that both of these theories are wrong. When interest rates hit zero, it's far from clear why or how the economy will quickly recover, since the usual way we bounce back from a slump – the central bank cuts interest rates, boosting spending – can't happen. Meanwhile, thanks in part to the reluctance of employers to cut wages even in the face of high unemployment, even obviously depressed economies seem at worst to experience low inflation, not an ongoing slide into accelerating deflation. Given these realities, consider how estimates of potential output will respond if an economy suffers a big decline in overall demand that persists for a number of years. Because the economy remains depressed for a long time, statistical methods that don't allow for this possibility will falsely interpret a sustained slump as a fall in potential GDP. Because inflation, while it may decline a bit at first in a slump, typically remains stable thereafter, models that try to infer potential output from changes in inflation will also conclude wrongly that the economy is operating near potential. So is the Great Shortfall something that exists only in policymakers' minds, when the real story is that there's still a huge amount of excess capacity? It's certainly a possibility worth considering. And I'm reasonably sure that when it comes to Greece in particular, the huge decline in estimated potential output is exaggerated. I simply don't believe that after a 25 percent decline in real GDP, almost none of it made up by recent growth, and with 20 percent unemployment even now, Greece is only 2 percent below potential – which is the IMF's estimate. But this is a harder story to tell for the U.S. or the euro area as a whole. The simple version of the hypochondria hypothesis would be that officials misinterpret high unemployment as a structural problem when it's actually a demand problem. But at this point neither the U.S. nor the euro area has high unemployment by historical standards. Everyone knows the U.S. story; Figure 4 shows the euro area unemployment rate, which while higher than the U.S. rate is also now low compared with pre-crisis norms. It's true that many people argue that the unemployment rate has become a misleading measure of labor market slack, that the job market isn't as good as the standard measure indicates. But as Figure 5 shows, even broader measures like labor-force participation of prime-age adults aren't down all that much, and they were on a declining trend even before the crisis. So even a ""hidden unemployment"" story won't explain the hugeness of the Great Shortfall – that is, it's not enough to make what we see consistent with a story that claims that it's all, still, about massively inadequate demand. Which brings us to the third story, which is that the Great Recession itself damaged potential output, largely by reducing productivity. The idea that recessions cause ""hysteresis,"" permanently or quasi-permanently reducing the economy's capacity, has been around at least since a famous 1986 paper by Olivier Blanchard and Larry Summers. Blanchard and Summers were thinking in terms of unemployment: their claim was that slumps in Europe had permanently raised the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation. But you can come up with various stories about how a big slump could hurt long-run prospects in other ways, for example by depressing business investment, including spending on R&D. If that sounds a little vague, that's because it is. Fatás, Summers, and others argue that there has been a lot of hysteresis, and my instinct is to agree with them; but I'm not aware of work that pins down the channels through which this is supposed to have happened with any precision. We really need people to do this work, because if hysteresis is the real story, if the Great Recession caused the Great Shortfall, it has huge implications for the future. 3. Why the Great Shortfall matters Nobody wants to go through a repeat of the Great Recession, which is a reason to pursue policies that both reduce the likelihood of another financial crisis and increase our ability to respond if one happens. Hence financial regulation, expanded ability to seize troubled financial institutions (so as to be able prop them up without bailing out stockholders and executives), and so on. Some of us have also argued for a higher inflation target, which would leave more room to cut real interest rates when the next slump comes. If the Great Recession really did cause the Great Shortfall, the urgency of such measures is much greater. Using conventional measures, the Great Recession and the depressed economy that lingered for years thereafter cost the U.S. something like 15 percent of a year's GDP. If the decline in long-term economic prospects was also caused by the slump, this cost rises to something much bigger – possibly more than 70 percent of a year's GDP so far, and much more to come. Beyond that, as Fatás and others have argued, a link between short-run economic weakness and long-run prospects makes a huge difference to our assessment of policies in response to crisis. If monetary policy has run out of room, the case for fiscal stimulus becomes much stronger. And the argument against the austerity policies that many countries adopted instead when interest rates were still near zero and unemployment very high becomes overwhelming. In fact, as Fatás says, an austerity mindset risks creating a ""doom loop,"" in which fiscal contraction leads to a decline in economic prospects, worsening the budget outlook, leading to even more contraction. Greece has slashed spending, at huge social cost, but been rewarded – at least according to the official estimates – with a drastic decline in future prospects, so that its debt outlook looks barely better than it did before the cuts. So the Great Shortfall – the long-term shadow on the economy apparently cast by the Great Recession – is a huge issue. It deserves more attention, with maybe less focus on the few months of credit crunch after Lehman fell.

Each group was advised by an expert in business or academia. Following are the topics, quotes from the panel leaders and three takeaways from each.  More stories from The New Rules Summit Special Report. ""This whole idea of a glass ceiling is the wrong metaphor, because glass seems easily shatterable. It's more like a concrete ceiling. What has gotten us here isn't going to get us to where we want to go. We haven't yet invented the practices we need to go from here to there,"" Molly Anderson, founder and chief executive of Exponential Talent LLC The importance of top leadership in this field cannot be overstated. Business leaders need to rethink what it means to take risks when advancing women to the top. It's not ""taking a risk on a woman."" It's making it a priority and changing the system. The risk here isn't making a mistake on one person by perhaps putting them in a role too early, the risk is losing out to other business leaders on a whole talent pool because you didn't tap into it. The only way to get policymakers to make legislative change around this is to get more women and allies to run for office. This means not only encouraging people to run but also teaching them how to do so, so they have a seat at the table. Political leaders must also get more people to vote. This means figuring out how to make it easier to vote, whether that means moving the voting day to a weekend day or encouraging voting by mail. Individuals need to have personal agency and recognize that their career and future are their own, taking an active role in it and responsibility for it. You've got to be asking for opportunities and rethinking how you are asking for feedback. Trying new approaches if a previous approach did not work. This also means taking responsibility to support other women in the work force. This could be mentoring or sponsoring others, or rewriting the rules of what you have control over. Just because someone in that role previously traveled on weekends doesn't mean that's the way it has to be done. Wherever we are in the scope of management, we can change the rules and set precedents and be transparent about it. ""There's a huge gap between intention and action. There are those who don't want to do the right thing. But there are people who want to do the right thing and don't get around to it, much like voting or healthy eating."" Iris Bohnet, Roy E. Larsen professor, academic dean and co-director, Women and Public Policy Program, Harvard Kennedy School  Don't let the work of calling out unconscious bias fall to the same people over and over: Assign a rotating role such as ""process czar"" in meetings so that everyone internalizes and is accountable for enforcing expectations about not interrupting colleagues or not echoing ideas without giving credit. Consider how technology can help: Once you've established expectations for how meetings will be conducted, include those expectations or a link to them in every meeting invitation that goes out, and send immediate follow-up surveys to assess how inclusive meetings or other activities truly were. Emphasize transparency in processes, incentives and outcomes. Make sure that potential outcomes of policies are considered through a variety of diverse lenses, and eliminate or adjust policies that lead to preferential outcomes for certain groups. For example, expand definitions of family care to account for unconventional support structures. Insist on inclusive budgeting, so that resources are proportionally allocated based on outcomes. Restrict the donations you accept to groups and individuals who promote outcome-focused inclusivity. In the workplace, try to flag biased behaviors in the moment, or shortly thereafter, and support others who call out co-workers for biased behaviors. To be able to assess your own biases and recognize them in others, take responsibility for to educating yourself, rather than waiting for your employer to provide training. Taking an active role in civic life is also necessary to create systemic change. Vote in elections, run for office and lobby in favor of policies that could have a wider impact. ""Progress on gender equality in corporate America is slow, we desperately need more women in boardrooms. Women are needed in these positions not only to enhance corporate performance but also to advocate for equal pay, fair promotions and help safeguard against sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace."" Debra L. Lee, the former chief executive and chairman emeritus of BET Networks Chief executives must make it a priority to promote diversity among their leadership and on boards. Companies should aim for women and minorities to make up half of their board members — given the makeup of the nation and most companies' consumers — and they should implement term limits, as the lack of turnover on boards is a big reason they remain so homogeneous. The search criteria for new directors should be broadened, and bigger slates featuring younger people, women and minorities should be offered over all. State governments should require public companies to have women on their boards because quotas — while they may provoke tension at first — work. California legislators recently passed a bill that would require public companies in the state to have at least one female director by the end of next year or face financial penalties. (Several European countries also have quotas.) Individuals can urge institutional investors and companies to hold boards accountable on diversity and personally invest in companies with diverse boards. Women and minorities seeking board positions at large public companies can build their profiles by serving on the boards of nonprofit organizations, particularly on audit committees. ""It's easy to think we're doing this work just for someone else but this has everything to do with you, your family, your children if they're a boy or girl. This work is about all of us."" Jeff Barth, senior director of Men Advocating Real Change at Catalyst We talk often about the power of mentorship. We talk less about the importance of reverse mentorship: being open to guidance and seeking feedback from people who are junior to you on all sorts of matters, including gender equality. Accepting open and honest feedback from women or employees from underrepresented groups helps elevate their voices and promote a culture of inclusion. This process can also help in redefining the sort of qualifications and credibility that are often subconsciously shaping managers' choices for potential candidates for hire or promotion, and sometimes biasing those choices toward men. The levers of government can be a powerful tool for influencing the sort of employment policies that shape gender relations. Policymakers can do so directly through raising the bar via legislation in areas like parental leave, and indirectly, by demanding certain standards from the companies that contract with the government. A focus on mandatory paid parental leave, for men and women, would give both a chance to not have their roles defined for them. Biases aren't bad or evil. We all have them. Recognizing and embracing our biases is crucial to understanding how they influence us. Listening to others' perspectives is the first step toward confronting your own biases. This may at times put you in an uncomfortable place. Embrace that discomfort and the idea that you may have blind spots that you haven't considered. And then engage those blind spots by inviting women and underrepresented people to speak. ""The sad truth about this is it's a problem where it's happening every day to too many people. I think we can make some progress, but it requires understanding. It's a really, really big problem to solve."" Marianne Cooper, sociologist at Stanford University's VMware Women's Leadership Innovation Lab When leaders take a stand, sexual harassment tends to occur less. Company leaders should establish a culture in which talking about sexual harassment is encouraged, and not punished. This does not mean simply including language in the employee manual. Every employee should understand what sexual harassment is, and there should be a system for people to immediately call out troubling behavior. For example, a ""red-yellow-green"" color system for categorizing behavior as acceptable or problematic could increase awareness and halt bad behavior in the moment. Education is crucial to changing a culture in which sexual harassment is allowed or dismissed as ""boys will be boys,"" or as girls' being seen as overly sensitive. And that training needs to happen at a young age. About half of girls report experiencing sexual harassment in school. Policymakers should establish sexual harassment education beginning as early as kindergarten and continuing through high school, based on research and what will be effective. If you see something, say something: Every person can take action by speaking up — when you experience sexual harassment or when you observe it. If you witness an incident in a meeting that strikes you as problematic, pull the woman (or man) aside afterward and ask, ""Are you O.K.?"" It's also important to understand hierarchy and be cognizant of your own privilege; the chief executive of a company will be better positioned to call out bad behavior than a first-year associate. If you are in a position of power, use it to benefit others who could face repercussions for speaking out. ""Sometimes pay disparity happens in organizations because people really haven't even looked. You have to look at your numbers. And then, the accountability piece is, you have to explain them."" Hannah Riley Bowles, co-director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard Kennedy School  To address the gender pay gap, companies need to be transparent and accountable concerning their pay and hiring practices. But companies should not be penalized for what this data shows. Instead, they should be encouraged to make progress. Employees should also understand how their earnings compare to industry standards. They also should not be afraid to ask for transparency about how their salary compares to colleagues or face retaliation for these questions. The United States could consider adopting Britain's gender pay-gap policies. These regulations require companies with 250 or more employees to publicly disclose salary data and any wage gap based on gender. It could be beneficial to require companies to adopt flexible work policies. Individuals should have conversations with three people inside and outside their organization regarding compensation. They should seek out situations where people feel the most comfortable and are the most likely to be transparent. Then, they should use these discussions to determine, to the best of their ability, how much their peers are being paid. Additionally, they should take advantage of online databases and consult with their companies' human resources departments to determine the general salary range for their position. ""Our solutions have to be that every woman is not dealing with it individually. It's not only a personal issue, but a social good. We have to come up with collective solutions."" Lori Nishiura Mackenzie, executive director of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University To ensure that consistent and fair opportunities are provided to parents over the course of their careers, corporate managers from the executive level down have a responsibility in recognizing that a variety of current managerial, technological and cultural norms must change. To begin, organizations must offer paid leave to all employees seeking family or medical leave. Additionally, work (including tasks, titles and organizational structure) can be structured so that it benefits working parents as well as the organization. Flexible schedules, or investments in telecommuting technologies, could assist in this. Finally, policies alone won't work. Working parents and their needs should be supported, regardless of gender — and that support should be publicly communicated — by both female and particularly male executives. Policy directed toward working parents often starts and stops at maternity leave offered immediately after a child's birth. That benefit should be expanded to both parents and primary caregivers, with added incentives to encourage parents concerned to take the time. But policymakers should also consider that parenting doesn't stop after infancy. Offering reliable universal child care, aligned with the workday, could assist in supporting working parents and working economies. Finally, policies against parental discrimination, not just gender discrimination, should be instituted and enforced. For individuals, one change of perception is vital: In the office, on the factory floor or anywhere work is done, the working parent must be considered the norm, not the exception. That is reality. If you are a parent, being open about your own joys and struggles will help normalize parenthood. It's all right to choose to prioritize your family. Finally, appreciate what skills and values a co-worker can bring as a parent, such as strong time management, flexibility and desire to build strong relationships. ""Continuing to admire the problem is no longer an option. These are industrywide problems and they require industrywide solutions."" Barbara Whye, chief diversity and inclusion officer at Intel Use data to get know who your people are beyond gender, with an eye toward solutions for a more equitable work culture. Do not put the burden of creating a more inclusive work space on the minority employees. Instead, deploy allies to be ambassadors within their own circles. Encourage ""ally events"" to expand conversation beyond identity groups. Create opportunities for safe spaces in which dialogue and open discussion can grant employees the opportunities to air issues, and for others to ask questions and learn how to be better colleagues. Rather than looking for the ""best person for the job,"" consider the best person for the team, focusing on richer diversity of perspectives. To build a more inclusive culture, it is incumbent upon policymakers to look at each decision through an intersectional lens (one that takes into account the unique barriers to equality facing people of color, disabled people and neurodivergent people, LGBTQ+ people and those of different socioeconomic backgrounds). Advance legislation guaranteeing equality in pay and salary transparency. Political leaders must become champions of bipartisan conversations around actionable solutions to problems beyond those that affect only their own demographics. Stop expecting underrepresented people to be the change agents. We need our political leaders to take the onus off the marginalized to enact cultural change. Speak up for those whose voices are not centered in conversations having to do with power and decision-making. Be willing to learn, and from what you learn, teach. Accept that every person is on a continuum of learning about experiences beyond their own. Call out misunderstanding, stereotyping and small-minded thinking in the spaces you occupy, not with anger or irritation, but rather by providing space for a more nuanced conversation about identity. You are the best catalyst for change within your own demographics. ""You do have to have a leader that is committed. It is really hard to make change unless your C.E.O. wants to make change. what we're missing is the critical gap between commitment and action."" Julie Sweet, chief executive officer — North America, Accenture  Accountability is key to making sure that company leaders include women, minorities and persons with disabilities in making decisions and developing strategy. This can be done through methods like regular audits or tying diversity metrics to bonuses and benefits. Company leaders should ensure that women and minorities are included in decision-making. They should consistently encourage staff members to speak up about whether or not initiatives are being implemented sufficiently, then make corrections when necessary. These conversations can be difficult, but sometimes those are the most necessary ones to have. Incentives are sometimes a necessary policy addition to promote inclusion. Benefits like tax credits or breaks for small businesses that are developing systems that successfully create a culture of inclusion can help advance the mission. Individuals can support inclusion in the workplace, by being positive role models, leading by example and embracing mentorship. Take time to welcome and meet with people who don't look like you, and attend affinity meetings for communities you aren't a part of. Your presence at these gatherings can show your commitment to working together. Take the opportunity to learn and grow from these conversations, and use your voice to amplify others in situations where they may not have the same level of privilege as yourself. It's important to know that even if you are a member of an underrepresented group, you can have blind spots. Everyone can benefit from talking to people from a diversity of backgrounds, taking stock of what stories, narratives and experiences are not represented and working to change that. "
News,2018-09-30,"WASHINGTON — The United States and Canada reached a last-minute deal to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement on Sunday, overcoming deep divisions to keep the 25-year-old trilateral pact intact.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/us/politics/us-canada-nafta-deal-deadline.html,1346," WASHINGTON — The United States and Canada reached a last-minute deal to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement on Sunday, overcoming deep divisions to keep the 25-year-old trilateral pact intact. The deal came after a weekend of frantic talks to try and preserve a trade agreement that has stitched together the economies of Mexico, Canada and the United States but that was on the verge of collapsing. After more than a year of tense talks and strained relations between President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, negotiators from both sides came to a resolution just ahead of a midnight deadline set by the White House. The 11th-hour agreement was punctuated by a frenetic Sunday, with Canada's leaders teleconferencing throughout the day with top American officials in Washington. Mr. Trudeau convened a 10 p.m. cabinet meeting in Ottawa to brief officials on the deal, as Jared Kushner, one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, and Robert E. Lighthizer, the president's top trade negotiator, hashed out the final details. Mexico's under secretary of foreign trade, Juan Carlos Baker, was expected to present the texts of the agreement to the Mexican senate just before midnight. In a joint statement, Mr. Lighthizer and Canada's foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, said the new deal ""will give our workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region."" The trilateral deal will no longer be called Nafta, they said, but will be named the ""United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement."" The deal represents a win for President Trump, who has derided Nafta for years and threatened to pull the United States from the pact if it was not rewritten in America's favor. Overhauling trade deals has been one of Mr. Trump's top priorities as president and he has used tariffs and other threats to try and force trading partners to rewrite agreements in America's favor. On Monday morning on Twitter, Mr. Trump called the agreement a ""great deal for all three countries."" The Trump administration struck a deal with Mexico last month to rewrite Nafta and had threatened to jettison Canada from the pact if it did not agree to concessions like opening its dairy market to United States farmers. The White House had set a Sept. 30 deadline to release the text of its new trade agreement with Mexico. The agreement reached on Sunday includes changes to several provisions in Nafta. ■ International settlement dispute: A system that allows Nafta countries to rely on an independent body to resolve disputes will remain intact. Canada had insisted on keeping this provision, known as Chapter 19. ■ Dairy: The United States will be allowed to increase dairy exports into Canada, a win for Mr. Trump, who had insisted on greater access for United States dairy farmers. ■ Autos: Requires a higher percentage of a car to be manufactured in North America to qualify for zero tariffs. For the first time, the deal requires that a percentage of any vehicle that qualifies for zero tariffs must be manufactured in a factory where the average production wage is at least $16 an hour. ■ Tariffs — Steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place on Canada and Mexico, pending further negotiations. Canada and Mexico secure at least a partial exemption from any potential future American tariffs on automobiles. Canada's agreement to ease protections on its dairy market will provide access that is greater than what the United States would have gained through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade treaty that Mr. Trump withdrew from last year. [Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Subscribe to our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.] The United States also relented on its demands to eliminate an independent tariff dispute settlement system that Canada has said is a red line in negotiations. Keeping that was a major concession for the United States and a change for what was agreed with Mexico. The countries also reached an understanding that would protect Canada from the automobile tariffs that Mr. Trump has routinely threatened, though it is not clear how far those protections would extend. A senior administration official said that if those tariffs were imposed on global imports, Canada and Mexico would receive ""accommodations"" for their existing car production. But in a sign of how fraught trade relations remain, Canada did not win assurances that Mr. Trump would lift the steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed earlier this year. Administration officials said that no changes had been made and that those levies are being addressed on a different track. The agreement builds upon the deal that was reached with Mexico in August. That made updates to provisions surrounding the digital economy, agriculture and labor unions. Most importantly it made alterations to rules governing automobile manufacturing, in an effort to bring more car production back to the United States from Mexico. ""It's a good day for Canada,"" Mr. Trudeau said late Sunday, after convening a meeting with his cabinet. He said he would deliver more details about the agreement on Monday. After months of sputtering talks, momentum picked up this weekend as Mr. Trudeau inserted himself and made clear that he wanted to get something done. Mexico has also scrambled to try and ensure that the Nafta pact remains trilateral. President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico said on Friday that Mr. Trudeau had appealed to him to help pave the way for a three-nation deal and that he would insist that a revised Nafta include Canada. While Canada had played down the end-of-the-month deadline, the talks were restarted in earnest this weekend as the United States and Mexico signaled they would release text of their bilateral trade agreement as early as Friday. Mexico wants a deal signed before Dec. 1, when the new Mexican administration takes over, and the Trump administration wants the current, Republican-controlled Congress to vote on the deal quickly, given a potential change in control after the November midterm elections. Lawmakers from both parties have urged the White House to include Canada in any revised Nafta, warning that excluding Canada, which is America's largest export market, could disrupt supply chains, cost jobs and slow the United States economy. Companies and business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have repeatedly called on Mr. Trump to ensure Canada remains part of the pact, which has become critical for industries across North America, including automakers, agriculture and manufacturers. Industry groups cheered the deal on Sunday night. ""Manufacturers are extremely encouraged that our call for a trilateral agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico has been answered,"" Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. Discussions between the United States and Canada had stalled amid souring relations between Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Trump, who lashed out at Canada last week during the United Nations General Assembly meeting for mistreating the United States on trade. The president said he had rejected a meeting with Mr. Trudeau because of Canada's high tariffs, though Mr. Trudeau's office said no meeting had ever been requested. Mr. Trump also threatened to tax Canada's auto exports into the United States if it did not agree to America's demands. That followed a testy meeting in June, when Mr. Trump accused Mr. Trudeau of being ""dishonest."" A revised Nafta that includes Canada has a far greater chance of being ratified by Congress but its fate is still somewhat uncertain. Democrats could take control of the House or the Senate in the midterm elections in November and attempt to call for changes to the agreement. ""The crucial test for a new Nafta, or any new trade agreement, is whether it is enforceable, particularly with respect to promises to protect worker rights and the environment,"" said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. ""Americans are sick of hearing speeches about the benefits of new trade agreements when the agreements in place aren't even enforced and their opportunities don't materialize."" Lawmakers have said they do not expect Congress to vote on the deal until early next year."
News,2018-09-30,Here’s what to expect in the week ahead:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/business/first-day-for-goldmans-new-ceo-and-job-numbers-come-out.html,512," Here's what to expect in the week ahead: BANKING Goldman Sachs will enter a new era on Monday, as David M. Solomon takes the reins. He succeeds Lloyd C. Blankfein, who led the firm for 12 years and steered it through the financial crisis. Since Mr. Solomon was named Goldman's ninth chief executive this summer, he has begun to put his management team in place. In September, the firm announced that John E. Waldron, the co-head of investment banking, would be president and chief operating officer, and Stephen M. Scherr, who runs the firm's consumer bank, would be promoted to chief financial officer. Over all, the bank's strategy, which Mr. Solomon helped devise a year ago as co-president, is not expected to change radically. One area he has indicated he wants to improve: the number of women the bank hires and promotes. — Stephen Grocer ECONOMY Eurozone ministers on Monday will discuss growth and jobs as well as exchange-rate developments in preparation for meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the Group of 20 countries in Bali, Indonesia, in October. A broader group of ministers from the European Union will also be discussing reform of the European Stability Fund. The Eurogroup must agree on a term sheet for development by December. — Amie Tsang Auto INDUSTRY Automakers are expected to show continued resilience on Tuesday, when they release figures for new vehicle sales for September. Auto sales reached a peak in 2016 of 17.6 million. While sales have since slowed, Edmunds forecasts that sales were on pace in September to end the year at 17 million. Although the pace was higher in September 2017, that was largely because of car buyers replacing vehicles damaged in Hurricane Harvey. Edmunds projects few sales of vehicles to replace those damaged by Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas. Still, it said, manufacturers' incentives to make room for new models helped keep sales robust this past month. — Matthew Sedacca ECONOMY American employers have added jobs for 95 consecutive months. September almost certainly was the 96th, extending what was already the longest streak on record to a full eight years. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expect the jobs report, due Friday from the Labor Department, to show that payrolls grew by 168,000 in September. That would be a modest slowdown from the gain of 201,000 jobs posted in August but might still be enough to push the unemployment rate down to 3.8 percent for the first time since May. (Before that, the unemployment rate hadn't been that low since 2000.) Economists will once again keep a close eye on wage growth, which has been picking up in recent months after a long period of sluggishness. A big gain would be good news for workers frustrated by meager raises, but might worry officials at the Federal Reserve, who are watching for signs of accelerating inflation. The data on Friday, however, could be muddled by the impact of Hurricane Florence, which struck the Carolinas in the middle of the month. — Ben Casselman"
News,2018-09-30,ISTANBUL — A group of residents have been protesting for more than 70 days at an empty building site in eastern Istanbul. ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/business/turkey-economy-development-protests.html,974," ISTANBUL — A group of residents have been protesting for more than 70 days at an empty building site in eastern Istanbul.  They sit on plastic chairs beside a couple of tents. New high-rise buildings surround them, but stagnant water has pooled on this site, and weeds sprout from the mounds of earth.  Around 300 homes were demolished as part of an urban development program in the district of Fikirtepe on Istanbul's increasingly fashionable Asian shore. The families have been living in rented accommodations until their residential block is built.  ""It was a beautiful neighborhood,"" said Kadriye Akguzel, who owned three apartments here with her son. ""Everyone had the key to their neighbor's house."" But construction has stalled as Turkey's economy has faltered. The private developers who were granted the license for this bloc of 85 landowners have halted construction over money disputes. Urban transformation has been one of the much-vaunted achievements of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 16 years in power. Whole sections of Istanbul, and many other cities, have been pulled down to be replaced with modern office buildings and homes. The redevelopment has spurred rapid economic growth in Turkey, generating employment and providing housing for Mr. Erdogan's voter base. Yet protests have swelled over Mr. Erdogan's emphasis on construction and growth at any cost. The construction boom, largely built on foreign credit, has brought wealth to a whole swath of construction firms. But it has also saddled the country with heavy private-sector debt that is more difficult to pay as the Turkish lira falls. Turkish banks have borrowed $186 billion, much of it denominated in American dollars. Some $77 billion will need refinancing in the next 12 months, according to Moody's Investors Service. Many construction projects have ground to a halt in recent months as credit evaporates amid soaring inflation and the sliding lira. In Fikirtepe, skeletons of half-finished tower blocks outnumber the glossy new apartment buildings. Cranes stand idle, and families are still living in crumbling houses awaiting demolition. Property firms are offering discounted deals to encourage sales as two million new apartments remain unsold around the country.  The Fikirtepe project was an ambitious effort to transform a central working-class district into an upmarket residential area. It was designated a Special Town Planning Area, which allowed contractors to build high-rise apartments. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim presided over the groundbreaking ceremony in 2017. He promised an entirely new city in Fikirtepe of ""beautiful, sparkling living spaces."" One block was to be called Brooklyn Dream. Some residents never wanted to sign up for the plan, which would demolish their homes, said Engin Akguzel, the son of Ms. Akguzel who is a driver and a spokesman for the group of protesters. Under the deal, the company offered to pay for rented accommodations for up to 42 months until they could move into the new apartment building. His father, now deceased, built the three apartments in the 1950s. His mother, Ms. Akguzel, lived in one apartment and used the income from the third to supplement her pension. He lived on the ground floor with his family. The 25 homeowners who had been resisting agreed to join the plan after a new law threatened to take their property for less compensation than the construction company was offering. The bulldozers moved in during the summer of 2016. The first sign of trouble came a year later, in June 2017, when the developer failed to pay the money for the landowners' rent. ""We became suspicious,"" Mr. Akguzel said. They checked on the developer and found that the company had changed hands. The new registered owner seemed to be a member of the firm's staff.  ""The owner got out of it, and now the man who serves the tea is the owner of the company,"" said Yasin Bektas, a resident who runs a local online news site and leads a separate protest group, which has sued the developers. The original investors have pulled out of the project and are involved in a lawsuit with their contractor. Mahir Sasmaz, the former head of construction for Pana Construction, the main developer, blamed rising costs and an inability to sell apartments for the company's difficulties. ""Costs increased, and the number of flats sold did not reach to the expected numbers,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""If sales remain at those levels, none of the contractors there will make a profit.""  Lawsuits take years in Turkey, and the families are worried about waiting that long. Most of his group are pensioners and cannot pay their rent, Mr. Akguzel said. He complained that officials at the ministry that oversees urban planning were unsympathetic even though they had pushed the residents to accept the project in the first place. Officials visited them before the June elections, promising assistance, but have avoided them since, Mr. Akguzel added. The ministry's deputy under secretary, Mucahit Demirtas, posted pictures and comments on Twitter promising to work on solutions for the protesters in June. ""We cannot leave the titleholders alone,"" he wrote after meeting with one of the original investors. The protesters are demanding that the government step in and ensure the block is built.  ""The state has the power,"" said Erol Torpil, an insurance adviser, who had opposed the plan from the start because he owned a block of five flats and lived off the rent from them. ""The only thing we want is for the houses to be built immediately."" But the protesters are careful not to criticize the increasingly authoritarian Mr. Erdogan, even if he has promoted the whole urban transformation. Many note that he has often publicly castigated real estate developers and building contractors in the past.  ""We are not angry with the president,"" Mr. Akguzel said. ""But I am personally heartbroken. I was thinking that the only person who could intervene was the president."" The attitude of officials since the elections had made his mother lose confidence.

They were hoping to get an appointment with a specialist, a chance for access to the best health care in the country. Scalpers hawked medical visits for a fee, ignoring repeated crackdowns by the government. A Beijing resident in line was trying to get his father in to see a neurologist. A senior lawmaker from Liaoning, a northeastern province, needed a second opinion on her daughter's blood disorder. Mao Ning, who was helping her friend get an appointment with a dermatologist, arrived at 4 a.m. She was in the middle of the line. ""There's no choice — everyone comes to Beijing,"" Ms. Mao, 40, said. ""I think this is an unscientific approach and is not in keeping with our national conditions. We shouldn't have people do this, right? There should be a reasonable system."" The long lines, a standard feature of hospital visits in China, are a symptom of a health care system in crisis. An economic boom over the past three decades has transformed China from a poor farming nation to the world's second-largest economy. The cradle-to-grave system of socialized medicine has improved life expectancy and lowered maternal mortality rates. But the system cannot adequately support China's population of more than one billion people. The major gaps and inequalities threaten to undermine China's progress, social stability and financial health — creating a serious challenge for President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party. Then, there are the scandals. In July, hundreds of thousands of children were found to have been injected with faulty vaccines. The news angered the public, rattling confidence in the government and amplifying frustration with the health care system. While the wealthy have access to the best care in top hospitals with foreign doctors, most people are relegated to overcrowded hospitals. In the countryside, people must rely on village clinics, or travel hundreds of miles to find the closest facility. The country does not have a functioning primary care system, the first line of defense for illness and injury. China has one general practitioner for every 6,666 people, compared with the international standard of one for every 1,500 to 2,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. Instead of going to a doctor's office or a community clinic, people rush to the hospitals to see specialists, even for fevers and headaches. This winter, flu-stricken patients camped out overnight with blankets in the corridors of several Beijing hospitals, according to state media. Hospitals are understaffed and overwhelmed. Specialists are overworked, seeing as many as 200 patients a day. And people are frustrated, with some resorting to violence. In China, attacks on doctors are so common that they have a name: ""yi nao,"" or ""medical disturbance."" In 2016, Mr. Xi unveiled the country's first long-term blueprint to improve health care since the nation's founding in 1949. Called Healthy China 2030, it pledged to bolster health innovation and make access to medical care more equal. The deficiency in doctors has taken on more urgency as the Chinese government grapples with the mounting health problems of its vast population. Heart disease, strokes, diabetes and chronic lung disease account for 80 percent of deaths in China, according to a World Bank report in 2011. Mao Qun'an, the spokesman for the National Health and Family Planning Commission, acknowledged that the hospitals could no longer meet the public's needs. ""If you don't get the grass roots right, then the medical problems in China cannot be solved,"" Mr. Mao said. ""So what we're doing now is trying to return to the normal state."" On some mornings, Dr. Huang Dazhi, a general practitioner in Shanghai, rides his motorbike to a nursing home, where he treats about 40 patients a week. During lunchtime, he sprints back to his clinic to stock up on their medication and then heads back to the nursing home. Afterward, he makes house calls to three or four people. On other days, he goes to his clinic, where he sees about 70 patients. At night, he doles out advice about high-blood-pressure medications and colds to his patients, who call him on his mobile phone. For all this, Dr. Huang is paid about $1,340 a month — roughly the same he was making starting out as a specialist in internal medicine 12 years ago. ""The social status of a general practitioner is not high enough,"" Dr. Huang said, wearing a gray Nike T-shirt and jeans under his doctor's coat. ""It feels like there's still a large gap when you compare us to specialists."" In a country where pay is equated with respect, the public views family doctors as having a lower status and weaker credentials than specialists. Among nearly 18,000 doctors, only one-third thought that they were respected by the public, according to a 2017 survey by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Harvard Medical School, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the U.S. China Health Summit. ""There is no trust in the primary care system among the population because the good doctors don't go there,"" said Bernhard Schwartländer, a senior aide at the World Health Organization and its former representative to China. ""They cannot make money."" China once had a broad, if somewhat basic, primary health care system. ""Barefoot doctors"" roamed the countryside treating minor ailments. In the cities, people got their health care at clinics run by state-owned companies. China's ""barefoot doctor"" system was one of the Communist revolution's most notable successes. In 1965, Chairman Mao, troubled by the lack of health care in the countryside, envisioned an army of people who spent half their time farming (many worked in the fields without shoes) and half their time treating patients. They weren't doctors, but rather a sort of health care SWAT team. The authorities gave them a short training period — several months to a year — and a bag of limited medicine and equipment. Average life expectancy in China increased to 63 years in 1970 from 44 in 1960, according to Theodore H. Tulchinsky and Elena A. Varavikova, authors of ""The New Public Health,"" a book about global medical care. The maternal mortality rate in rural China fell to 41.3 per 100,000 people from 150 per 100,000 before 1949, according to a 2008 article published by the World Health Organization. In the same period, the infant mortality rate fell to 18.6 per 1,000 from 200. But the public was fed up that it could not get medical treatment whenever or wherever it wanted. People needed a referral to see a specialist in a hospital. In the mid-1980s, the government lifted the barriers, allowing people to be treated in hospitals. At the same time, China began an economic overhaul that led to the dismantling of the entire system. Government subsidies were cut drastically, and hospitals had to come up with ways to generate profits. As hospitals started investing in high-tech machines and expanded to meet their new financial needs, medical students were drawn to them. Many believed that being a specialist would guarantee them an ""iron rice bowl,"" a job that was secure with an extensive safety net that included housing and a pension. Dr. Huang initially followed the more lucrative path. After graduating from medical school in 2006, he started working as an internist in a hospital in Shanghai. But he kept seeing patients with simple aftercare needs like removing stitches, changing catheters and switching medication. ""These things really should not be done by us specialists,"" he said. When Dr. Huang saw a newspaper article about general practitioners, he decided to enroll in a training program in 2007. He was inspired by his aunt, a ""barefoot doctor"" in Mingguang, a city in Anhui Province, one of the poorest regions in China. As a boy, he had followed his aunt as she went to people's homes to deliver babies and give injections. ""After becoming a doctor, I've realized that the people's needs for 'barefoot doctors' is still very much in demand,"" he said. In March, a doctor was killed by his patient's husband. In November 2016, a man attacked a doctor after an argument over his daughter's treatment. The month before, a father stabbed a pediatrician 15 times after his daughter died shortly after her birth. The doctor did not survive. Dr. Zhao Lizhong, an emergency room doctor in Beijing, was sitting at a computer and writing a patient's diagnosis when Lu Fu'ke plunged a knife into his neck in April 2012. Around him, patients screamed. Hours earlier, Mr. Lu had stabbed Dr. Xing Zhimin, who had treated him for rhinitis, in the Peking University People's Hospital and fled. Police officers arrested him in his hometown, Zhuozhou in the northern province of Hebei, later that month. Mr. Lu was sentenced to 13 years in jail. ""We know that this kind of thing can happen at any time,"" Dr. Zhao said. The root of the violence is all the same: a mistrust of the medical system. It goes back to the market reforms under Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s. After the government cut back subsidies to hospitals, doctors were forced to find ways to make money. Many accepted kickbacks from drug companies and gifts from patients. In a survey of more than 570 residents in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou conducted in 2013 by Cheris Chan, a sociology professor at the University of Hong Kong, more than half said they and members of their family gave ""red envelopes"" as cash gifts to doctors for surgery during 2000-12. Dr. Yu Ying, who worked as an emergency room doctor at Peking Union Hospital, one of China's top hospitals, said she was once a valiant defender of her profession. On her widely followed account on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, she pushed back against critics who called doctors ""white-eyed wolves."" ""After I discovered the truth, I really had to give myself a slap in the face,"" she said. Dr. Yu said she had heard accounts from outpatient doctors who accepted thousands of dollars in kickbacks from drug companies — ""cash that was bundled into plastic bags."" ""In the entire system, the majority of doctors accept red envelopes and kickbacks,"" she said. The corruption is endemic. GlaxoSmithKline paid a $500 million fine in 2014, the highest ever in China at the time, for giving kickbacks to doctors and hospitals that prescribed its medicines. Eli Lilly, Pfizer and other global drug giants have settled with regulators over similar behavior. It all makes for a violent mix. Many hospitals are taking measures to protect their workers. In the southern city of Guangzhou, the Zhongshan Hospital has hired taekwondo experts to teach doctors self-defense techniques. Hospitals in the eastern city of Jinan are paying private security companies for protection. Last year, the government pledged to station an adequate number of police officers in emergency departments, where most doctor-patient violence occurs. Mr. Mao, the spokesman for the health ministry, said that while the figures for attacks on medical personnel looked alarming, they needed to be put in context. Chinese patients sought medical help eight billion times in 2016, a number that is equivalent to the world's population, according to Mr. Mao. There were roughly 50,000 medical-related disputes in that period, a tiny fraction of the total number of health visits. ""Therefore, our judgment is the doctor-patient relationship in reality isn't tense,"" Mr. Mao said. If Beijing hopes to overhaul health care, it needs to persuade a skeptical public to stop going to the hospital for the sniffles. To help change the culture, China is pushing each household to sign a contract with a family doctor by 2020 and subsidizing patients' visits. General practitioners will also have the authority to make appointments directly with top specialists, rather than leaving patients to make their own at hospitals. Such measures would make it easier for patients to transfer to top hospitals without a wait, while potentially giving them more personalized care from a doctor who knows their history. It could also cut down on costs, since it is cheaper under government insurance to see a family doctor. After the government's directive, Dr. Yang Lan has signed up more than 200 patients, and monitors their health for about $1,220 a month. From her office in the Xinhua community health center, a run-down place with elderly patients milling about in the corridors, she keeps track of her patients with an Excel sheet on her computer. She said she had memorized their medical history and addresses. Dr. Yang, 31, said her practice was largely free of grumpy patients and, as a result, ""yi nao."" She sees 50 to 60 patients in a workday of about seven and a half hours. In the United States, a family doctor has 83 ""patient encounters"" in a 45-hour workweek, according to a 2017 survey by the American Academy of Family Physicians. That's about 16 patients in a nine-hour workday. The patients get something, too — a doctor who has time for them. Every three months, Dr. Yang has a face-to-face meeting with her patients, either during a house call or at her clinic. She's available to dispense round-the-clock advice to her patients on WeChat, a popular messaging app in China. A patient is generally kept in the waiting room for a brief period and, if necessary, gets to talk with her for at least 15 minutes. On a hot summer day, an elderly woman with white hair walked into Dr. Yang's clinic. She has cardiovascular disease, and Dr. Yang told her to watch what she ate. Next, a man with diabetes dropped in. ""Hey, you got a haircut!"" Dr. Yang exclaimed. At one point, four retirees swarmed Dr. Yang's room, talking over one another. ""I think she's really warm and considerate,"" said Cai Zhenghua, the patient with diabetes. He used to seek treatment at a hospital, he said, adding, ""The time spent interacting with doctors here is much longer."" The government aims to increase the number of general practitioners to two or three, and eventually five, for every 10,000 people, from 1.5 now. But to even have a chance of reaching its goals, China needs to train thousands of doctors who have no inkling of how a primary care system should function and little interest in leaving their cushy jobs in the public hospitals. It is forcing hospital specialists to staff the community clinics every week and paying those doctors subsidies to do so. It is also trying to improve the bedside manner of doctors with government-backed training programs. In Shanghai, Du Zhaohui, then the head of the Weifang community health service center, introduced a test that uses mock patients to evaluate the care and skills of general practitioners. The doctors have 15 minutes to examine ""patients."" The teachers use a checklist to grade the doctors on things like making ""appropriate eye contact"" and ""responding appropriately to a patient's emotions."" At a recent test, one doctor, wearing crystal-studded Birkenstock sandals, examined a patient who had insufficient blood flow to the brain by swinging a tiny silver hammer, the equipment that is used for testing reflexes. ""That isn't the right way,"" Li Yaling, head of the center's science and education department, said with a sigh. She said the doctor was probably too nervous and should have used a cotton swab to stroke the soles of the patient's feet instead. Dr. Zhu Shanzhu, a teacher in the program, said one of the main problems was that doctors did too few physical examinations in the community clinics. Many of them lean toward prescribing medicine instead. Clinical reasoning, too, is poor, she said. In 2000, Dr. Zhu designed a course to train general practitioners in Shanghai's Zhongshan Hospital, at the request of its director. Her first course was free. No one showed up. Nearly two decades later, Dr. Zhu, 71, says that training is still insufficient and doctors do not spend enough time studying the latest research and techniques in their field. ""If there's more money, the good people will come,"" she said. ""And a high economic status will elevate the social status."" The government has pledged to increase the salaries of family doctors. But Dr. Zhu isn't optimistic. ""All these ministries need to coordinate among themselves,"" she said. ""Our country's affairs, you know, they aren't easy."""

His administration has followed through on that strategy with a proposal to add a question to the 2020 census asking about citizenship. If the question remains on the form, millions of households, particularly Hispanic and Asian-American, could skip the census, leading to an overrepresentation of white Americans during this once-a-decade count. Six lawsuits seeking to remove the proposed question are moving through the federal courts, with the first trial likely to take place this fall. If it is added to the census form, the citizenship question will distort our understanding of who resides in the country. What this selective underenumeration will not do is make America's growing racial minority populations disappear. The losers from this undercount include members of Mr. Trump's older white base, who will suffer from lost investments in a younger generation, whose successes and contributions to the economy will be necessary to keep America great. The demographic trends make this plain. America's white population is growing tepidly because of substantial declines among younger whites. Since 2000, the white population under the age of 18 has shrunk by seven million, and declines are projected among white 20-somethings and 30-somethings over the next two decades and beyond. This is a result of both low fertility rates among young whites and modest white immigration — a trend that is not likely to change despite Mr. Trump's wish for more immigrants from Norway.  The likely source of future gains among the nation's population of children, teenagers and young working adults is minorities — Hispanics, Asians, blacks and others — most of whom are born in the United States. Indeed, the only part of the white population that is growing appreciably is older people, the same group to whom Mr. Trump is appealing. Thanks to aging baby boomers, the older retirement-age white population will grow by one-third over the next 15 years and, with it, the need for the government to support Social Security, Medicare, hospitals and the like. Revenue for these programs will have to come from the younger minority population. If the census does not accurately count this population, then all the services that support children and future workers, such as public education, Head Start, the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid, will be shortchanged. Although the slowly growing, rapidly aging white population will be accurately counted, the fast-growing minority school-age and young adult populations that represent the nation's future will not get their due — demographically, politically or economically. An in-house Census Bureau analysis based on 2010 survey data found that the inclusion of a citizenship question reduced the response rate among households that have at least one noncitizen individual. While 7 percent of United States residents are themselves noncitizens, 14 percent live in households that include one or more noncitizens. The latter figure rises to 46 percent among all Hispanics and to 45 percent among Asian-Americans, compared with just 8 percent among blacks and 3 percent among whites. Let's assume that one in three people in Hispanic and Asian noncitizen households refuses to answer the census. If that's the case, the Hispanic share of the United States population would drop by 2.1 percentage points (from 17.3 to 15.2 percent) and the total white population share would rise by 2.2 percentage points (from 62 to 64.2 percent). This imbalance would influence congressional reapportionment, hurting large, immigrant-heavy states. It will also shape how congressional and state legislative districts are drawn, favoring rural and small areas at the expense of large metropolitan areas, since noncitizen households are far more prevalent in the latter. The underenumeration of racial minorities would also misallocate billions of dollars in state and federal funds for housing assistance, job training, community development and a variety of social services that should be distributed on the basis of census counts. It would provide a faulty framework for surveys that will inform thousands of policy and business decisions, such as where to locate schools, hospitals, employment sites or retail establishments catering to different population groups, over the next decade. Through his rhetoric and actions, Mr. Trump stands for keeping America white, appealing to his base by implicitly promising to preserve the racial status quo. But Mr. Trump's supporters, and the country in general, must not ignore the generational dependency between older whites and younger minorities. Forcing an inaccurate accounting of who resides in the nation will have long-term negative consequences for everyone. William H.

News,2018-10-01,California became the first state to require its publicly held corporations to include women on their boards after Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill into law on Sunday.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/business/women-corporate-boards-california.html,904," California became the first state to require its publicly held corporations to include women on their boards after Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill into law on Sunday. The bill, which applies to companies ""whose principal executive offices"" are in California, requires them to have at least one woman on their boards by the end of 2019. In 2021, the companies must have a minimum of two or three women, depending on the size of their boards. Hundreds of companies will be affected by the law, according to The Los Angeles Times, and those that fail to comply can be fined $100,000 for a first violation and $300,000 for a second. In signing the legislation, Mr. Brown acknowledged that critics have raised ""serious legal concerns"" about it, which he conceded ""may prove fatal to its ultimate implementation."" Still, he copied his letter to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee, which last week narrowly voted to recommend Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and send it to the full Senate, despite allegations of sexual assault against him. ""Recent events in Washington, D.C. — and beyond — make it crystal clear that many are not getting the message,"" Mr. Brown said. Hannah-Beth Jackson, a Democratic state senator who represents Santa Barbara and helped write the legislation, applauded its signing on Twitter. She has said that a quarter of California's publicly traded companies do not have a woman on their boards, despite studies showing that companies that do are more profitable and productive. (Some research, however, has suggested that the findings are less conclusive.) For instance, Stamps.com — which has its headquarters in El Segundo, Calif., but is incorporated in Delaware — has an all-male, five-member board, and told The Los Angeles Times on Sunday that it ""is reviewing the law."" Although California is the first state to enact such a mandate, others have passed resolutions about increasing the number of women on company boards, Ms. Jackson has said. Several nations, such as France, Germany and Norway, have already developed gender diversity requirements for corporate boards, she has said. ""Yet another glass ceiling is shattered, and women will finally have a seat at the table in corporate board rooms,"" Ms. Jackson said on Sunday. She added, ""This is a giant step forward for women, our businesses and our economy."" Charles Elson, a professor and the director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that while the goal of the legislation was laudable, the law was unwise and California will ""ultimately regret it."" Company shareholders, he said, ""should be able to elect any representatives they want."" And it is in their best interest to be able to pick representatives from a broad pool ""to get the best possible people regardless of their sex."" ""When you start telling people they have to elect someone on the basis of an immutable characteristic, it's very problematic,"" he said. ""This goes to the heart of democracy."" The bill was opposed by a coalition of business groups led by the California Chamber of Commerce, which argued that the quotas were ""likely unconstitutional, a violation of California's Civil Rights statute, and a violation of the internal affairs doctrine for publicly held corporations."" In a letter, the coalition said the intent of the bill was good, but expressed concern that the legislation ""potentially elevates"" gender ""as a priority over other aspects of diversity."" ""If there are two qualified candidates for a director position, one male and one female,"" the letter said, the bill ""would require the company to choose the female candidate and deny the male candidate the position, based on gender."" And that has raised legal concerns. Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who has written about the bill, said on Sunday that it amounts to a ""blatant gender preference."" To pass legal muster, she said, a law of this kind must show that there is both an important governmental reason for it, and that there is not a better way to achieve the outcome. ""I don't think the courts will uphold the law,"" she said, adding that legal challenges could surface as soon as next week. ""I so, so strongly believe that we don't have anything near gender equality. And I really don't think the government mandating it is the answer. You could have incentives, tax breaks or preferential government treatment if you reach certain diversity thresholds."" Professor Levinson also said she believed that the move by Mr. Brown amounted to an ""enormous raising of a certain finger"" to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In essence, she said, it was Mr. Brown's ""MeToo moment."" ""If ever there was a week to sign this bill, it was this week,"" she said. ""Governor Brown is not really in the business of liking to sign laws that are subject to serious legal challenges."" Mr. Brown, though, signed it anyway. And as has become his habit over decades in political office, Mr. Brown sprinkled a hint of historical whimsy into the conclusion of his signing letter. ""As far back as 1886, and before women were even allowed to vote, corporations have been considered persons within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment,"" he wrote. ""Given all the special privileges that corporations have enjoyed for so long, it's high time corporate boards include the people who constitute more than half the 'persons' in America."""
News,2018-10-01,"Tax evasion is at the center of the criminal cases against two associates of the president, Paul Manafort and Michael D. Cohen. The sheer scale of their efforts to avoid paying the government has given rise to a head-scratching question: How were they able to cheat the Internal Revenue Service for so many years?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/business/economy/irs-tax-fraud-audit.html,1484," Tax evasion is at the center of the criminal cases against two associates of the president, Paul Manafort and Michael D. Cohen. The sheer scale of their efforts to avoid paying the government has given rise to a head-scratching question: How were they able to cheat the Internal Revenue Service for so many years? The answer, researchers and former government auditors say, is simple. The I.R.S. pursues fewer cases of tax evasion than it did less than 10 years ago. Provided you're not a close associate of President Trump, there may never be a better time to be a tax cheat. Last year, the I.R.S.'s criminal division brought 795 cases in which tax fraud was the primary crime, a decline of almost a quarter since 2010. ""That is a startling number,"" Don Fort, the chief of criminal investigations for the I.R.S., acknowledged at a New York University tax conference in June. Bringing cases against people who evade taxes on legal income is central to the revenue service's mission. In addition to recouping lost revenue, such cases are supposed ""to influence taxpayer behavior for the hundreds of millions of American citizens filing tax returns,"" Mr. Fort said. With fewer cases, experts fear, Americans will get the message that it's all right to break the law. Starting in 2011, Republicans in Congress repeatedly cut the I.R.S.'s budget, forcing the agency to reduce its enforcement staff by a third. But that drop doesn't entirely explain the reduction in tax fraud cases. Over time, crimes only tangentially related to taxes, such as drug trafficking and money laundering, have come to account for most of the agency's cases. ""Due to budget cuts, attrition and a shift in focus, there's been a collapse in the commitment to take on tax fraud,"" said Chuck Pine, who used to be the third-ranking criminal enforcement officer at the I.R.S. and is now a managing director at BDO Consulting. ""I believe there are thousands of individuals who have U.S. tax obligations and are not complying with U.S. tax laws."" The result is huge losses for the government. Business owners don't pay $125 billion in taxes each year that they owe, according to I.R.S. estimates. That's enough to fund the Departments of State, Energy and Homeland Security, with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration tossed in for good measure. Unlike wage earners who have their income separately reported to the I.R.S., business owners are often on the honor system. The I.R.S. declined to comment on its enforcement efforts. Mr. Cohen's and Mr. Manafort's cases illustrate different but common types of tax cheating, and how the I.R.S. has struggled to enforce the law. Mr. Cohen failed to report income from domestic businesses. Mr. Manafort used foreign locales and shell corporations to hide his money. Mr. Cohen's tax evasion schemes were straightforward. Besides paying off a pornographic movie star and a former Playboy model in violation of campaign finance laws, he pleaded guilty to lying on his tax return. Whether it was income from his business owning taxi medallions, millions of dollars in interest payments on a loan he had made to another taxi operator or the $30,000 he made by brokering the sale of a luxury handbag, Mr. Cohen simply hid the money from his accountant and the government. Over five years, he didn't disclose $4.1 million, saving himself $1.5 million in taxes. The I.R.S. typically catches such evasion by auditing taxpayers. Theoretically, evidence picked up in audits can be used to start criminal cases. But the rate at which the agency audits tax returns has plummeted by 42 percent since the budget cuts started. Criminal referrals were always rare and are becoming rarer still, dropping to 328 in 2016 from 589 in 2012. With the government conducting 1.2 million audits in 2016, that's one criminal referral for roughly every 3,600 audits. ""The focus of auditors and tax collectors is not to identify fraud, it's to collect tax,"" said a special agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Management has set other priorities, the agent said, ""so by default, the employees are not doing it."" In addition, current and former I.R.S. agents say audits are not as intensive as they used to be. Because the I.R.S. pushes agents to close audits more quickly, they make fewer requests for records and interviews. 50 thousand 40 33,200 30 Enforcement staff  20 Includes examinations and collections personnel as well as special agents. 10 0 '08 '10 '12 '14 '17 1.0 % 0.8 0.6 0.5% Audit rate 0.4 Includes individual and business tax returns. 0.2 0 '08 '10 '12 '14 '17 50 thousand 1.0 % 40 0.8 33,200 30 0.6 Audit rate Enforcement staff  0.5% Includes examinations and collections personnel as well as special agents.

""That is what people popularly think we should be doing, and I'm trying to say it ain't so."" Budget cuts have diminished the criminal investigation division, trimming the number of agents by a fifth since 2010. Recently, the I.R.S. closed four of its 25 field offices, according to Mr. Fort. In New York State, home of the country's financial industry, the revenue service is down to 161 agents, about a hundred fewer than it had 15 years ago. It doesn't help that many agents prefer chasing flashier crimes than tax evasion. Rob Warren, a research associate at Catholic University who previously spent a quarter-century at the I.R.S., interviewed 30 former special agents. He asked them which of their cases had been their favorite. The answers, Mr. Warren said, typically were only tangentially related to taxes. ""It was usually narcotics, Ponzi schemes, some public corruption,"" he said. ""Agents loved Ponzi cases because there was a real victim, an old lady or something like that."" Federal prosecutors seek out special agents for these cases because they are skilled financial investigators. And tax crimes, like failing to declare illegal income from, say, a bribe or cocaine sales, can be easier to prove than bribery or drug trafficking. In recent years, the I.R.S. has also been pulled away from classic tax-dodging cases by soaring rates of identity theft. I.R.S. management assigned scores of agents to chase perpetrators who used stolen identities to collect tax refunds. One tax fraud hotbed that has been a clear priority of both the I.R.S. and the Justice Department is going after money Americans stashed overseas without reporting it to the federal government. But there are clear reasons that Mr. Manafort, who hid his money in places like Cyprus and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, might still have escaped detection. Switzerland has been the Justice Department's primary target over the past 10 years, an effort that has resulted in settlements with the giant Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse, and dozens of smaller institutions. The I.R.S. allowed Americans with foreign accounts to voluntarily disclose them and pay a smaller penalty than they would have had they been caught hiding the information. Some 56,000 people participated, netting the government $11.1 billion. The I.R.S.'s criminal division also brought several cases against people for concealing accounts. For all this success, there has been little change in the amount of wealth stashed overseas. Americans have about $1.2 trillion of personal assets in tax havens, according to data compiled by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and two colleagues. It's unclear what portion has been disclosed to the I.R.S. ""What has happened over the last 10 years is real progress,"" Dr. Zucman said. ""But what the data suggest is that it has not had a dramatic effect on the amount of offshore wealth."" Money has flowed out of Switzerland and into Asian tax havens like Hong Kong and Singapore. Moreover, the I.R.S. has made little use of new weapons in the fight against wealth hidden overseas. In 2010, President Barack Obama signed a law that was supposed to provide a crucial tool for government auditors and prosecutors. That law, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, required banks with American account holders to report information to the United States. Like W-2 forms that employers file to tell about their workers, these reports would force account holders to come clean. Eight years later, the program is still getting off the ground. Countries around the world have signed agreements, and more than 100,000 foreign banks have sent information to the United States. But ""there is no ongoing compliance impact of the FATCA at this time,"" according to a report this year by the inspector general for the I.R.S. The report found serious problems with the millions of records collected so far. About half, for example, didn't include identification numbers for the taxpayers, making it difficult to match the accounts with individuals. The I.R.S. hadn't set up a process for using the records. The agency said it was working on such a system. Here, too, the cuts to the I.R.S.'s budget have had an impact. During the Obama administration, the I.R.S. asked Congress for hundreds of millions of dollars to carry out the program, but received nothing. Since Mr. Trump took office, the agency has stopped asking."

",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/nyregion/new-jersey-venture-capital-murphy.html,1140," When he campaigned for governor, Philip D. Murphy leaned on a recurring quip in his stump speech: ""New Jersey was Silicon Valley before there even was a Silicon Valley."" He was conjuring the New Jersey of a decade ago, when the state was a leader in new and thriving companies in industries like biotech.  Now, as he seeks to reshape the state's economy, Mr. Murphy wants New Jersey to utilize one of the most quintessential, lucrative and risky practices of Silicon Valley: venture capitalism.  As part of an economic plan the governor announced on Monday, Mr. Murphy proposed to establish a fund that would allow the state to partner with private venture capitalists to invest in start-up companies that agree to set up shop in New Jersey.  Mr. Murphy's move toward providing cash through public-private partnerships, rather than offering more traditional tax incentives to lure new business, comes as New Jersey struggles to develop homegrown companies. While New Jersey was among the top five states for venture capital investment a decade ago, it has fallen to 15th.  ""We've had a very sort of blunt-instrument, one-size-fits-all, big-company-focused tax incentive program that was our whole strategy,"" Mr. Murphy said in an interview. ""And almost nothing toward the start-up community."" The proposal is both unusual and routine: States often try to incentivize new companies to lay down roots, often with mixed results. But directly investing in start-ups carries additional risks. The companies could fail, and New Jersey would lose much-needed tax revenue. The private firms also could choose not to share their most lucrative opportunities with the state.  New Jersey has also recently seen its younger generations flee the state, limiting the talent pool that is vital to start-ups.  And this being New Jersey, putting state money into private companies has the potential to lead to political favoritism or corruption.  ""This is going to have to be very transparent process,"" Mr. Murphy said.  The proposal calls for raising $500 million over five years to create the New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Fund. About $250 million would be generated through an auction of tax credits to New Jersey corporations and the other half would come from matching funds from private venture capital firms.  Venture capital is among the riskiest of asset classes, and directly involving state funds could lead to losses. But Mr. Murphy said the current tax incentive plan was not working.  ""I look at the results for what we've gotten back, and we're spending a billion dollars per year"" and still falling behind, Mr. Murphy said, referring to current tax incentives. ""We're trying to jump-start industries that have been in our sweet spots forever. Life science, advance manufacturing, biotech, to pick a few."" The governor, through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, plans to auction off $60 million worth of tax credits every year for five years to major companies with tax liabilities in New Jersey.  The governor's model predicts that the tax credits will sell for roughly 90 cents on the dollar, giving some of New Jersey's major companies a tax break. That auction money — which the authority estimates will be about $250 million — would fund the program. This, of course, means the state would be diverting tax revenue into the new fund.  Through a dollar-for-dollar match from private-industry partners, the state hopes to build a fund of $500 million.  This type of fund is more useful to entrepreneurs than traditional tax breaks, Mr. Murphy said. ""Tax incentives for start-ups is a non sequitur because they don't have any profits,"" Mr. Murphy said. ""So there's nothing to tax."" The E.D.A. is under Mr. Murphy's control, enabling him to create the New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Fund without the approval of another branch of government. But auctioning tax credits would require legislative approval. Mr. Murphy said on Friday that he had ""already begun those conversations.""  Stephen M. Sweeney, the Senate president, did not return requests for comment.  The two men have had a checkered legislative record since Mr. Murphy became governor in January. Working together, they passed some progressive bills on issues like voting rights, immigration and the environment, but they disagreed bitterly over the so-called millionaire's tax, leading to a fight that nearly shut down the government.  Still, Mr. Murphy said he is ""pretty optimistic, actually"" that he will have the needed legislative support.  No. New Jersey is looking to partner with the firms.  The state does not want to be solely responsible for vetting pitches and business plans. Instead, it would partner with a venture capital firm once that firm had decided to invest.  If, for example, an entrepreneur is seeking $20 million to launch a product and finds a venture capital firm willing to invest, the firm can then request that the state split the cost. The goal, according to the governor's office, is to minimize the private company's risk while offering an incentive to provide funding to start-ups in New Jersey. Mr. Murphy said he has not spoken to any venture capital firms yet.  Chris Sugden, a managing partner at Edison Partners, a New Jersey-based venture capital firm, said he liked the idea.  ""Having the New Jersey program come in to put 50 percent of the bucks to match it, that's pretty attractive,"" Mr. Sugden said. But, he added, the wheels of government and the speed of venture capital do not always move in sync.  ""This market moves fast,"" Mr. Sugden said. ""The best deals — you've got to be able to move fast. And that's how I've shared it. I understand the desire to make sure the money is invested in New Jersey, but you also don't want guys in my business to be missing deals."" Any company receiving investments from New Jersey will need to be based in the state.  ""That's the only 'must' with this plan,"" Mr. Murphy said.  But restrictions in the venture capital world can be problematic, said Ian Hathaway, the research director at the Center for American Entrepreneurship, which studies start-ups.  ""You start getting into problems when you put restrictions on it, because if I'm a top-tier investor, why do I even want to deal with that?"" he said.  Mr. Hathaway said government programs designed to spur start-up growth need to ""get their house in order first.""  That, he said, ranges from ""making sure you have favorable capital gains tax policies"" to more indirect issues. ""Like what is the quality of life in New Jersey for well-educated professionals who have the option to live somewhere else?"" Mr. Hathaway said. New Jersey ranked 50th in the 2019 State Business Tax Climate Index issued by the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank. ""There's a difference between making it easier for companies that are already in the state to raise venture capital,"" Mr. Hathaway said. ""It's quite another to say: Will people pick up and move to New Jersey because there's more capital available?"" "
Op-Ed,2018-10-01,"How we farm matters. For the past two centuries, America’s farms have expanded and homogenized, and farming equipment and chemicals have replaced personnel. Farmers have grown older and more isolated and are retiring without successors.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/opinion/wendell-berry-agriculture-farm-bill.html,2360," How we farm matters. For the past two centuries, America's farms have expanded and homogenized, and farming equipment and chemicals have replaced personnel. Farmers have grown older and more isolated and are retiring without successors. Our embrace of industrialization and ""factory farming"" has not resulted in greater economic security for most American farmers. The nation has suffered a historic slump in prices for corn, soybeans, milk, wheat and other commodities. It has lost half its dairy farmers in the past 18 years. And The Wall Street Journal warned in early 2017 that ""the next few years could bring the biggest wave of farm closures since the 1980s.""  The farmer, essayist and poet Wendell Berry has long argued that today's agricultural practices are detrimental to ecology, community and the local economies that farms once served. A native Kentuckian, Mr. Berry has written over 40 works of fiction, nonfiction and poetry, and has received a Guggenheim fellowship, the National Humanities Medal and the Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award. Mr. Berry argues that healthy forms of agriculture require intentional cultivation on the part of both consumers and farmers. Americans presume there will always be enough — money, clean soil, healthy water — to fulfill our desires. But our ravenous economic disposition goes against the very nature of our world and its finite resources. Advocates for sustainable agriculture argue that we ought to recognize the limits of our world and, as Mr. Berry writes, ""live in it on its terms, not ours."" This year's proposed Farm Bill awards millions of dollars to wealthy agribusiness and factory farms in the form of commodity subsidies and crop insurance, while cutting funds for important conservation and stewardship programs and offering little to beginning farmers and ranchers or local farmers markets and local food promotion. Mr. Berry, as an ally of Wes Jackson of the Land Institute and others, has long argued for a 50-year Farm Bill that would rejuvenate our nation's ecosystems while fostering long-term food security in the United States.  Gracy Olmstead: The Farm Bill usually promotes short-term economic gains over long-term ecological health (something the 50-year Farm Bill seeks to fix). How do we get Washington politicians to support more sustainable forms of agriculture? Wendell Berry: The problem here is not so much that of the shortness of the term of planning or of shortsightedness as it is of ecological and agricultural ignorance and a sort of moral blindness. The problems we ought to be dealing with are not problems because they are going to cause us trouble in the future. They are problems because they are obviously and clearly causing trouble right now. We ought to be doing our best to solve them right now. If politicians and journalists want to know about the problems of agriculture, they are not likely to go out into ""rural America"" to observe the condition of the fields and the waterways or to talk to the farmers and the ex-farmers, the ex-merchants of the small towns, or to talk to the mayors and county judges of rural counties. Instead, they are very likely to talk to academic and bureaucratic experts, who are tightly bound within the industrial structure of agriculture, agri-science and agribusiness. Alan Guebert was right when he said in one of his columns that this farm bill will be much like the last one insofar as it will not address the real problems of agriculture. Those problems, as you know, are soil erosion, soil degradation, the pollution of waterways by sediment and toxic chemicals, various ecological damages, the elimination of small farms, the destruction of the cultures of husbandry and the ruin of country towns and communities. And maybe we should add specifically the curse of overproduction, which at present, as often before, is the major and the cruelest problem. Those problems could be summed up as the triumph of industrialism and industrial values over the lives of living creatures, and over the life of the living world. The preferences and choices of industrialism do not imply a limit of any kind. They rest instead upon the premises of limitless economic growth and limitless consumption, which of course implies limitless waste, and finally exhaustion. Nothing can take form except within limits. No cure is possible, either in policy or practice, except within understood limits, which is to say within a correct diagnosis. This requires patience. A good solution has to begin with a description of the problem that is full, clear, and reliable. Olmstead: The Farm Bill addresses many issues, including ""rural development"" — and rural communities desperately need help these days. Could the government help combat these issues, in your community and elsewhere? Berry: A farm bill sincerely intending to help rural communities might begin by proposing a program of production controls and price supports for every product of farming and forestry. At present, for example, the dairy ""industry"" is increasing milk production by millions of gallons every year, thus reducing prices and driving small dairies out of business. This of course serves the interests of large dairies. A bill intending to help rural communities, furthermore, might forbid the large chain stores to underprice their goods in order to destroy locally owned small stores. I don't see why the government should not enforce honest prices for the same reason that it enforces honest weights and measures. I am sure that a lot of conservatives would object loudly to such ""regulation."" But for small farms and small businesses, the ""free market"" is not a ""level playing field."" Olmstead: Many conservatives and libertarians see the Farm Bill's handouts to large agribusinesses as the opposite of a free market. If small farmers are given a level playing field, they argue, more will succeed — and industrial agribusiness will no longer have a government-provided financial cushion.  Berry: I distrust entirely the terms ""free market"" and ""level playing field."" Those phrases are intoned as if they were the names of gods, but what do they mean? How exactly do the conservatives and the libertarians think small farmers would be served by the free market and the level playing field? The problem that has impoverished and destroyed farmers nearly always is that of low prices resulting from surplus production. That is also, obviously, a land-destroying problem. The only solution to that problem that can sustain the small farmers is the combination of production control and price supports as exemplified by the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association as it was reorganized in my region under the New Deal in 1941. I dislike recommending my own writing, but that organization and its work are explained pretty fully in ""The Art of Loading Brush."" The conservative politicians and their friends in the Farm Bureau hated that program because it protected the small farmers, and they finally killed it. In its absence, our troubles have multiplied. Recently, for example, 100 family dairy farms have been put out of business in this region, two of them in my county, because Walmart is building its own milk-bottling plant in Indiana. And so 100 self-employed, self-supporting, self-respecting farm families are being severely damaged or destroyed in order to increase the wealth of a family already far too rich. I am unsure what the farmers themselves have concluded, but I can conclude only what I already knew: They have no friends among the conservatives and libertarians. And if the Democrats and the liberals were to capture the government, those small farmers would find no friends among them, as they now are. Both of the political sides, so far as I am concerned, have to accept responsibility for the emergence of Donald Trump, the autonomous man, the self-made man, economically ""free"" and sexually liberated, responsible only to himself, starting from scratch and inventing his own way of doing things. To get outside the trajectory that produced Trump, we will have to go back to tradition. I am unsure when we began to think of, for instance, the 15th Psalm and Jesus's law of neighborly love as optional. They are not optional, as I think the Amish example proves, and as proved by present failure. Olmstead: Our trade war with China has highlighted American farmers' reliance on the global market. Do you believe this reliance is a necessary risk in today's globalized economy? How can these farmers safeguard their own self-sufficiency and well-being? Berry: I have been arguing for a long time, and I still argue, that an economy worthy of the name should begin with proper care of its sources in the natural world and in the local cultures of land use. Beyond that it should be based upon the principle of a reasonable self-sufficiency, from the household to the local community and on through the categories of political organization. Such an economy, within the variables of weather and human capability, would be formed within certain prescribed limits. To the extent that it would be limited and formed or formal, we might assume that it would be stable. Because such an economy has never been tried, we should not think of it with too much confidence. But there is certainly nothing limited or stable in our present casting about the ""globe"" for supplies and demands. This, like our present society, is disorderly if not chaotic. The so-called global economy, because it is predicated on the exhaustion of natural sources and of the land-use economies, is far from a sure thing. An interesting question, then, is whether we might intentionally reform our economies upon the principle of self-sufficiency or be forced to do so by the failure of the global economy. Farmers by themselves can't protect themselves in a ""free market"" economy whether it is national or global. At present they have only the very limited self-protection of supporting their own lives so far as possible from their own land — that is, by producing their own food and fuel, and by harvesting energy from their own sunlight. Olmstead: An Iowa farmer recently told me that industrial agriculture is inevitable — the natural fruit of technological progress and globalization. The farmer reminded me of others I have talked to who, when asked about farming practices that are industrialized and isolating, reply by saying ""We must feed the world.""  Berry: If you can persuade farmers that their hardships are ""inevitable,"" then you have got them very securely trapped and they can be safely forgotten by their political representatives and exploited by agribusiness corporations. Inevitability and objectivity, like pessimism and optimism, are the names of programs offering freedom from choice and responsibility. If ""technological progress"" is the same as technological determinism, then there are no remedies. It can pretty well be demonstrated, however, that technological progress is the result of choices that have been made all the way from the inventors and manufacturers of technologies to the people who buy and use and pay for them. The important questions all have to do with the standards by which these choices are made. If the standards were different, different choices would be made.  And in fact we have plenty of evidence that choices can be made that evidently were not made by your Iowa farmer. That the alternative choices often have to be made against powerful social pressures does not mean that they cannot be made or that they are not valid choices. The finally inescapable standards by which agricultural choices must be made are the ecological health of the farm and the economic health of the farmer. The problem of feeding the world should be addressed, first of all, by calculating the waste — from farmland and topsoil to thrown-away food — in the world's ""food systems."" Perhaps somebody has done this. If so, that is the place to start. The people, fairly numerous and highly credentialed, who argue that only industrial agriculture as we now have it can feed the world are arguing in fact that we can feed the world only by an agriculture that destroys both farmland and farmers. There is a point, obviously, beyond which this kind of agriculture will not be able to feed much of anybody. Olmstead: As farmers grow older, we seem unable to attract or keep young people on the land. For some, this is because of the cost of procuring land and starting a farm. But I have also talked to farmers who were told they were ""too smart"" to farm by high school counselors and mentors. These admonitions align with a larger cultural prejudice against manual labor and blue-collar work. Considering the challenge to farming's future which this represents, how can we foster and renew a passion for farming?  Berry: That smart people are ""too smart"" to farm is one of the set of clichés by which industrial agriculture has maintained itself. Another is that farming is ""drudgery"" or ""mind-numbing work."" Another is that ex-farmers have been ""liberated"" from their hard, narrow, and depressing lives. These clichés are sustained by the ""larger cultural prejudice against manual labor,"" which you mention. But there also are active prejudices against farmers, country people, the country, small-town people and small towns. This at least begins the description of a large cultural problem. Because of such prejudices, and also because of economic adversity, farmers encourage their children to leave farming. Their departing children, so few of them as they now are, amount to an invaluable cultural and economic resource, to which our present economy attaches no value at all. What can we do about this? First, those of us who care must keep trying to bring about improvements, which we can do, and are doing, locally — where, in any event, the improvements will have to be made. Second, we have got to be patient. That this is a cultural problem means that it can't be simply or quickly solved. What you speak of as a ""passion for farming"" can grow only from an understanding of the intelligence and the learning involved in the right kind of farming, and we should add an understanding of the better cultures of husbandry and of the traditional agrarian values. These things we must try to keep alive, not because of their ""potential value"" but because they are now and forever right. Gracy Olmstead is an Idaho native living and writing outside Washington.

The Department of Homeland Security released a draft regulation on Sept. 22, in which it proposed that any immigrant who is likely to use or who has already used Medicaid, public housing or a rent voucher, cash assistance or food stamps could be barred from the country or kept from getting permanent resident status. The proposed rule change is part and parcel of the Trump administration's hostility to immigrants. But it's also about more than that. The administration would remake the idea of self-sufficiency, admitting only those who never need to turn to the public safety net, but instead rely solely on ""their own capabilities"" or the resources of their families and private charity. It even asserts that people who use public programs ""in a relatively small amount or for a relatively short duration"" are still considered dependent on the welfare state. This redefinition of self-sufficiency ignores the way that most people use these programs. Even people with jobs often cycle on and off assistance as work comes and goes, or to plug the gaps when it just doesn't pay enough. These programs allow people to remain healthy and solvent — supporting their independence. This rule therefore hurts everyone, not just immigrants, by stigmatizing the safety net funded by all of us to help people survive when they fall on hard times. Take food stamps. According to a study in March by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nearly three-quarters of the non-disabled adults below the age of 59 who receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in a typical month worked in the year before receiving assistance or in the year after. Over half work in the same month they participate. Most people aren't on food stamps for very long; they go on and off as work comes up or falls through, using the program to keep themselves and their families fed when money is short. Medicaid is similar. The Kaiser Family Foundation reported in June that nearly two-thirds of non-elderly, non-disabled enrollees work, but most have low-wage jobs that don't come with many benefits, including health insurance. The majority of Medicaid recipients work full-time, but they still face high rates of financial insecurity. Medicaid helps ensure that they and their children can stay healthy even if their employers don't offer insurance. The same pattern appears among those who get help with rent: Among families who received rental assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2016, 58 percent worked; they just didn't make enough to afford the roof over their heads. These families would most likely chafe at the idea that they aren't independent or self-sufficient. They're working and trying to earn a decent living. But given the way our low-wage, service sector economy functions — offering erratic, stingy jobs — it's often not enough to survive. So families patch together the holes in their finances with the threads of our safety net. Under the administration's new rule, any immigrant who needed this kind of help — food stamps when work dries up, Medicaid and rental vouchers when it doesn't stretch far enough — could be denied an extension of their stay or a more permanent status because of that need. By making such a change and labeling these people ""public charges,"" the administration is signaling even to the native born that using government programs as stopgap measures makes you a leech on the system. The Department of Homeland Security estimates that the deterrent effect of this rule would result in immigrants forgoing $2.3 billion in federal and state benefits a year, benefits that they would otherwise be eligible for. The department does not estimate how many other Americans will be pushed away from these programs because of the potential stigma. But if the rule becomes federal policy, it's hard to see how anyone would feel the right to use the social safety net. And that is indeed the point. The Trump administration has been seeking ways to keep people from using these programs, mainly through its quest to add work requirements for recipients of nearly any public program. Such requirements similarly ignore the reality of recipients' lives and add another bureaucratic hurdle many can't clear. The administration is also considering reorganizations and budget cuts that threaten these programs' existence. The sum of its actions is to further steep the social safety net in a stew of shame. The average American will use between four and five government benefits in a lifetime, and yet 44 percent are against ""welfare."" Right now, some public assistance programs, such as Medicaid, still enjoy widespread support. But if the Trump administration gets its way, virtually any assistance the government offers will be smeared with the same sentiment.

News,2018-10-01,Good Monday. Want this by email? Sign up here.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/business/dealbook/elon-musk-tesla-sec.html,1806," Good Monday. Want this by email? Sign up here. Elon Musk reached a deal with the S.E.C. on Saturday night to resolve securities fraud charges tied to his bid to take Tesla private. The deal requires him to step aside as the automaker's chairman for three years — though he can remain C.E.O. — and pay a $20 million fine. Tesla must also name two independent directors and monitor Mr. Musk's communications with investors. Mr. Musk spoke with Mark Cuban, an entrepreneur who had his own battles with the S.E.C., before reversing his decision to settle. The deal means that Mr. Musk won't risk being banned from serving as an executive or director of a public company, and came about under pressure from lawyers and shareholders. (Tesla's shares plummeted on Friday, giving short sellers $1.3 billion in profit.) But how much will really change? Investors express hope that new board members will force Mr. Musk to focus on solving Tesla's many problems. In particular, the need to appoint a new chairman could give Tesla a chance to install an outsider with a fresh perspective. But critics quickly pointed out that the new chairman would probably hold the job for a short time. And the two new directors could be outvoted by the other board members, who are widely considered close to Mr. Musk. (Among them is his brother, Kimbal.) The company's policing of Mr. Musk's communications with the outside world may be the largest change, given how much trouble his tweets have caused. But little has changed so far: He emailed Tesla employees on Sunday to promise that Tesla could turn a profit soon. And this morning he tweeted a link to the music video ""O.P.P."" by … Naughty by Nature. Bonus: It's worth reflecting on the message the S.E.C. sent here. Mr. Musk reportedly backed out of a settlement with the agency last Thursday, adamant that he had done nothing wrong. In settling just two days later, the S.E.C. appeared to have been accommodating of the Tesla chief's quick change of heart. The U.S. and Canada struck a last-minute deal to salvage the trade pact last night. The agreement saves the 25-year-old trilateral pact, which had been close to collapse after months of bickering. The deal — which will now be called the ""United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement"" — includes big concessions: • Canada will ease protections on its dairy industry and give the U.S. more access to its markets. • The U.S. won't eliminate an independent tariff dispute system or impose auto tariffs on Canada. (Aluminum and steel ones may remain, though.) Sunday's breakthrough came after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada became involved in the talks over the weekend. He even asked Mexico, which had already reached an accord with the U.S., to intervene. Both sides see this as a win. But President Trump may celebrate most: As the WSJ notes, it shows his administration can actually strike trade deals, not just rip up old ones or impose tariffs. The social network disclosed a huge data breach on Friday, in which the accounts of more than 50 million users were compromised. The largest such event so far in the company's 14-year history, it allowed hackers to gain access to accounts and potentially take control of them. Facebook will come under intense scrutiny for the hacking — especially in the E.U., whose tough new General Data Protection Regulation can inflict big fines if a company did not do enough to safeguard user data. The WSJ explains that the social network could face a maximum penalty of $1.63 billion if that is found to be the case. The hacking is another headache for Facebook. The company has been buffeted over the last year by scandals including the abuse of user data and the manipulation of the social network for election meddling. Goldman Sachs's new C.E.O. starts. David Solomon takes the reins of the Wall Street firm from Lloyd Blankfein. His ascension comes as Goldman reduces dependence on trading, to favor businesses like investment banking and consumer lending. Eurogroup finance ministers meet. They will discuss growth and jobs as well as exchange-rate developments in preparation for meetings of the I.M.F. and the G-20 countries in Bali, Indonesia, in October. Britain's Conservative Party holds its annual conference. Prime Minister Theresa May will confront many vocal critics of her Brexit strategy, and could find herself in a tussle to keep control of the party. The Supreme Court begins a new term with eight justices. For the moment, the court is split down the middle ideologically. California on Sunday adopted its own net neutrality regulations, after the F.C.C. rescinded its rules last year. Hours later, Justice Department officials told The Washington Post that the administration would sue to block the move. California's new laws are tougher than those enacted by the Obama administration. They forbid internet service providers from intentionally slowing web services or blocking online content, and ban them from accepting money to make some services run faster. The F.C.C. had warned that such efforts could face legal action. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that California had ""enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy."" More on what it means, from Tony Romm and Brian Fung of the WaPo: The F.C.C.'s efforts immediately put Washington on a collision course with the states. To start, more than 20 states filed lawsuits against the F.C.C., arguing that the agency had acted arbitrarily in repealing the net neutrality rules. Their efforts have won the support of companies like Mozilla and trade associations representing tech giants including Amazon, Facebook and Google. The state now requires public companies based there to have a minimum number of female directors. The new law, the first of its kind in the U.S., mandates that companies must have at least one woman on their board by the end of 2019. About 165 companies will be affected. Facebook and Tesla don't currently comply, for example, and will need at least three women on their board by 2021. The bill has detractors. Even Gov. Jerry Brown acknowledged that the law could face legal challenges. Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware, told the NYT that companies ""should be able to elect any representatives they want."" Most people remember 2016 for continued economic growth, falling unemployment and continued consumer spending. But Neil Irwin of the Upshot points out that it brought economic trouble for the industrial sector in the U.S., as a web of global events made life difficult. There was a sharp slowdown in business investment, caused by an interrelated weakening in emerging markets, a drop in the price of oil and other commodities, and a run-up in the value of the dollar. The pain was confined mostly to the energy and agricultural sectors and to the portions of the manufacturing economy that supply them with equipment. The mini-recession ended when China let banks borrow more and the Fed held interest rates steady. But Mr. Irwin notes that the dip may have had serious consequences — including making Donald Trump's economic message more attractive to those in the affected industries. Compensation in the start-up scene is often intensely guarded. But the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has compiled industrywide data on pay, based on surveys of executive search firms, and Business Insider got its hands on a copy from 2017. Here are some insights: • The median salary offer for a C.E.O. role at a Series C consumer products company is $325,000 in cash, with a 50 percent bonus and a 6 percent stock grant. • The median salary for a senior director of engineering at a young Series A start-up is about $200,000 in cash, with a 0.58 percent stock grant. Business Insider created interactive charts using the data, and they are worth studying to see how much these workers make — and how companies alter compensation as they get older. ThyssenKrupp named Bernhard Pellens as its new chairman and Guido Kerkhoff as its permanent C.E.O. Thomas Kurian resigned as Oracle's president of product development.

Within weeks, millions of people had viewed it. Here, nearly eight years later, he says that he got it largely wrong. It has been 10 years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers marked the unofficial start of the financial crisis. For those of us in finance who lived through that period, and the countless others affected by it, it remains hard to think of it as just a moment in history. A decade removed, the experience feels more like a mass injury that — grateful as we are to have survived — still lingers, and often manifests itself in the ongoing controversy over the government's response. I am a small part of that controversy, thanks to a YouTube cartoon I published in 2010 criticizing the Federal Reserve's bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing. The popularity of that cartoon surprised me. Like most things that go viral, it was more a testament to what was on people's minds than the quality of the work. Nevertheless, terms used in the cartoon like ""The Bernank"" entered the economic zeitgeist, resonating with people who knew that they didn't like what was happening but lacked the technical vocabulary to express why. Most of the targets of my cartoon, including Ben Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, have defended their actions and maintained that their work was effective in keeping the economic harm from worsening. I'm inclined to agree. Quantitative easing worked, just not in the way it was intended. Before I explain why, I need to admit what I got wrong. Contrary to what one of my cartoon characters predicted, Q.E. didn't ""blow up the global economy."" Instead, both economic growth and the financial markets have been remarkably steady. If anything, the expansion of central bank balance sheets has dampened volatility. It's still possible that the reversal of those policies will have a destabilizing effect, but even if that does happen — and I hope it doesn't — I was still way off the mark. The current economic expansion is one of the longest in history, and that too has surprised me. If you had asked me to predict the odds of another major recession eight years ago, not only would I have called it likely, I probably would have added that the very policies used to deal with the 2008 financial crisis would cause it. I was wrong about that, too. So what did I get right? There's a false belief in some circles that my cartoon was among the chorus of critics that predicted an inevitable debasement of the dollar — a belief possibly spurred by Mr. Bernanke's reference to my work in his memoir. But my focus, as can still be seen in the cartoon, was on the mechanics of Q.E. Ironically, those mechanics are something that Mr. Bernanke and I have always agreed on. He has often defended his actions by arguing that Q.E. is not the same as printing money because it only affects reserves in the banking system. Leaving aside the obvious overlap between the two concepts, I believe he's right. Q.E. was, first and foremost, a policy designed to enrich banks. In that sense, it worked remarkably, and tragically, well. Thanks to the one-two punch of the bailouts (some of which were also financed by the Fed) and Q.E., our banking system came back from the brink of collapse in just a few years. In 2010, Wall Street managed near-record profitability and paid near-record bonuses. This was no accident. As Mr. Bernanke argued in a Washington Post op-ed in late 2010 (and exactly one week before the publication of my cartoon), the two primary outcomes of Q.E. are lower interest rates and higher asset prices. Nobody benefits from either of those more than Wall Street does. Left unmentioned in the op-ed were those guaranteed to not benefit, like the substantial portion of the population that doesn't own any assets, or the countless people that could never get a loan. Lower rates are viewed as desirable in a downturn because they spur borrowing. But that belief — held by the vast majority of economists — leaves out the inconvenient truth of who it is that gets to borrow in the first place, especially in the aftermath of a crisis. The millions of people who lost their homes in foreclosures, for example, don't. Nor do the millions more who lost their jobs. Who does benefit? All the parties that have done disproportionately well in the past decade, like investment funds, large corporations and the wealthy. Debt levels have exploded among those groups, as have the valuations of the assets they tend to own: private companies, premium real estate and stocks. For this, I give Mr. Bernanke credit. History turned out almost as he predicted in his op-ed: ""Lower corporate bond rates will encourage investment. And higher stock prices will boost consumer wealth and help increase confidence, which can also spur spending. Increased spending will lead to higher incomes and profits that, in a virtuous circle, will further support economic expansion."" ""Almost"" because the only thing missing from his prediction were the words ""for some people."" One of the great ironies of monetary debates over the past decade is the consensus that you should not just print money and hand it out to ordinary citizens. That, as Mr. Bernanke argued in a series of essays published by the Brookings Institution a few years ago, should only be considered as a last resort. It is better, he argues, to send money to the banks. According to government data, almost a fifth of the United States population is either ""underbanked"" or entirely disconnected from the financial system — a percentage that grew after the 2008 crisis. These are the people who have suffered the most in the past decade. Their existence outside the banking system almost guaranteed that they would not benefit from policies like lower interest rates. Quantitative easing worked, but not for those who needed it most. There was one other thing that I got wrong about the government's response to the financial crisis. I assumed that the effects, and side-effects, would be felt in the economic realm. But today, it's the political, social and even technological consequences that stand out. The growing wealth gap, which we now understand to be at least partially caused by such policies, has fueled many political and social movements. In this era of political polarization, the one belief that the far left and the far right increasingly share is that our economic system is somehow rigged. That perception has played a part in everything from the insurgent campaign of Bernie Sanders to Donald Trump's presidential victory. Most surprising of all, though, is that there is now a new kind of money — one borne out of the chaos of the financial crisis and the controversial policies enacted thereafter. Bitcoin and other digital currencies are the technological solution to a legacy monetary system that increasingly looks unfair. The decentralized nature and radical transparency of cryptocurrencies are a response to a banking system where institutions that were ""too big to fail"" have been enriched by Q.E. The code that underpins the Bitcoin blockchain is designed to treat the poorest citizen exactly the same way as the most powerful banker. After everything that's happened in the past decade, we can no longer say the same thing about the Fed. I disagree with some of my colleagues in the so-called cryptosphere on the potential for such coins to ever fully replace fiat money. But I am a proponent for many reasons, including the lifeboat they offer from poorly conceived economic policy. Despite the enduring controversy of the policies enacted in response to the financial crisis, their architects promise to repeat them in the future. But next time, those of us who are adversely impacted by such policies, or just morally opposed to them, won't have to stand idly by. Next time, we can take our money elsewhere."
News,2018-10-01,WASHINGTON — President Trump said Monday that the revised North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada would pour “cash and jobs” into the United States. But the deal’s importance may have less to do with the details than the signal it sends that Mr. Trump is methodically settling his multifront trade war to fight a single enemy: China.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/us/politics/nafta-deal-trump-canada-mexico.html,1551," WASHINGTON — President Trump said Monday that the revised North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada would pour ""cash and jobs"" into the United States. But the deal's importance may have less to do with the details than the signal it sends that Mr. Trump is methodically settling his multifront trade war to fight a single enemy: China. A jubilant Mr. Trump celebrated the new Nafta agreement as the fulfillment of a bedrock campaign promise. He claimed it was a vindication of his aggressive use of tariffs and vowed to keep imposing them to extract deals from other trading partners, like the European Union and Japan. But while Mr. Trump expressed confidence about eventually reaching deals with Europe and Japan, he was far more grudging about China, saying it was too soon to begin talking. Administration officials say privately that Mr. Trump is content to leave tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods in place for the foreseeable future to weaken its hand. ""China wants to talk very badly,"" Mr. Trump said at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden. ""I said frankly it's too early to talk, because they're not ready."" He added, ""If politically, people force it too quickly, you're not going to make the right deal."" The updated Nafta, which will be called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or U.S.M.C.A., represents Mr. Trump's biggest trade achievement to date, and it comes after more than a year of intense negotiations that frequently fell into personal rancor between Mr. Trump and the leaders of Canada and Mexico. [Alan Rappeport, a Times reporter, answered questions about the new trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.] After languishing for weeks, negotiations with Canada suddenly broke through Friday morning, according to a senior American official. The Trump administration, having received a detailed proposal from Canadian officials the day before, submitted a counteroffer, which the Canadians accepted in principle. With a deal safely in hand, Mr. Trump lavished praise on Mexico's outgoing president, Enrique Peña Nieto, with whom he had tangled repeatedly over the phone. He was less effusive about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, but suggested their Cold War was over, too. It was not personal, Mr. Trump suggested about both men; it was just business. ""We had very strong tensions,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It was just an unfair deal, whether it was Mexico or Canada, and now it's a fair deal for everybody. It's a much different deal. It's a brand-new deal. It's not Nafta redone."" Still, like some of Mr. Trump's other accomplishments in business and government, the deal is partly a step forward and partly an exercise in rebranding. Canada will ease longstanding protections on its dairy market and provide access greater than what the United States would have gained through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade treaty negotiated by President Barack Obama, from which Mr. Trump withdrew last year. The United States relented on its demand to eliminate an independent tariff dispute settlement system that Canada had said was a red line. Preserving it was a major concession for the United States, which had eliminated the mechanism, known as Chapter 19, as part of its deal with Mexico. The pact also makes a series of changes to areas like intellectual property and the digital economy, including protections for patents and domain names — all of which refresh Nafta, a 25-year-old pact that had become somewhat outmoded in the digital age. But many of these innovations were drawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which included Canada and Mexico, and it prompted a senior Trump adviser to offer a rare endorsement of an Obama legacy achievement that Mr. Trump delighting in dismantling. ""We're building on what was done in T.P.P.,"" said Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative. ""I'm in no way trying to knock the people that negotiated T.P.P."" But he added, ""Because we had the benefit of that, our agreement is substantially better than T.P.P."" Mr. Lighthizer pointed to changes in regulations governing automobile manufacturing, which he said would bring more car production back to the United States. Under the agreement, a greater percentage of vehicles would have to be made in North America to qualify for Nafta's zero tariffs. A significant portion of the vehicles would also have to be assembled by workers earning at least $16 an hour — a wage floor intended to increase jobs in the United States and Canada, where wages are higher than in Mexico. While inflation will erode this wage protection over time, officials noted that the pact's terms could be reviewed every six years. Analysts said the agreement might have an incremental impact on American automotive jobs, and might push car prices slightly higher. But Ford Motor Company said in a statement that it was ""encouraged"" by the accord, noting that a three-nation trade zone ""will support an integrated, globally competitive automotive business in North America."" The United Steelworkers union urged caution, lamenting that the Trump administration's steel and aluminum tariffs had not been lifted as part of the deal. The commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, described those as ""separate issues,"" and Mexico and Canada say they expect those tariffs to be worked out on a separate track. Mr. Trump said the United States was talking with Mexico and Canada about potentially replacing them with quotas. Also unresolved is whether Canada and Mexico will continue retaliatory tariffs on American products like whiskey, orange juice and chocolate. Mr. Trump must now submit the deal to Congress, where a potential change in control from Republicans to Democrats could throw its passage into doubt. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, made clear on Monday that Mr. Trump's deal would not receive a rubber stamp. But the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, offered a rare endorsement of Mr. Trump's approach. ""As someone who voted against Nafta and opposed it for many years, I knew it needed fixing. The president deserves praise for taking large steps to improve it,"" Mr. Schumer said in a statement. He cautioned, though, that ""any final agreement must be judged on how it benefits and protects middle-class families and the working people in our country."" Experts on trade delivered a mixed verdict on the agreement. Parts of it, they said, were a much-needed update to Nafta. But other parts could restrict trade in a way that would ultimately hurt American consumers and increase uncertainty for American companies. ""He started this conflagration with Mexico and Canada, as he has with other trading partners,"" said Daniel M. Price, a former trade adviser to President George W. Bush. ""That he may put out the fires after they have destroyed significant acreage does not vindicate either the strategy or the result."" The White House is moving on several fronts to settle the trade disputes Mr. Trump started. Last week, Mr. Trump signed a revised trade agreement with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. He and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan agreed to begin talks on a deal, after months of resistance by Tokyo. ""They finally got their act together and decided they can't win all these wars, so they're settling many of them and focusing on China,"" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""They're lining up the ducks for this gigantic battle with China."" There are no plans for trade negotiations between China and the United States, although the president's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said Mr. Trump might meet President Xi Jinping of China at a summit meeting in Argentina in late November. On Monday, Mr. Trump raised the prospect of even more tariffs against China and said his actions were taking a toll on the Chinese economy. Although he voiced hopes about a deal with the European Union — and praised Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president with whom he agreed to hold off on auto tariffs — White House officials said the negotiations with Europe would be arduous. Jared Kushner, the president's senior adviser and son-in-law, played a significant role in smoothing over the final sticking points between the United States and Canada, according to officials. He met informally with the Canadian foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, during the transition, and kept in touch with her, even as Mr. Trump's relationship with Mr. Trudeau became fraught. ""The relationship that we've been able to build with the countries established a lot of trust, both with the Canadians and Mexicans,"" Mr. Kushner told reporters. ""It was through that trust that we were able to talk about a lot of these issues."" Mr. Trump and Mr. Trudeau spoke by telephone Monday morning, though Mr. Trudeau later dodged questions about whether the agreement would restore his relationship with the president. ""The relationship between the U.S. and Canadians is much deeper than just the relationship between two individuals who happen to be prime minister and president,"" Mr. Trudeau said. At the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump exulted in the abbreviation for the new agreement, U.S.M.C.A., which he predicted that ""99 percent of the time we'll be hearing."" That rebranding, however, may prove to be one of Mr. Trump's biggest challenges. Even in his briefing with reporters afterward, Mr. Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer, referred to the deal as Nafta."
Review,2018-10-01,"THE DINOSAUR ARTIST Obsession, Betrayal, and the Quest for Earth’s Ultimate Trophy By Paige Williams 410 pp. Hachette. $28.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/books/review/dinosaur-artist-paige-williams.html,1207," THE DINOSAUR ARTIST Obsession, Betrayal, and the Quest for Earth's Ultimate Trophy By Paige Williams 410 pp. Hachette. $28. As far as case law goes, there are more consequential decisions than The United States of America v. One Tyrannosaurus Bataar Skeleton. Few, however, feature a more charismatic defendant. In 2013, the United States literally arrested the skeleton of a giant apex predator dinosaur slumbering in a warehouse in Queens. But understanding how this came to be first requires a panoptic survey of everything from the world of the Late Cretaceous period to the 1990s rise of right-wing politics in Mongolia. This is the dizzying task that Paige Williams, a staff writer for The New Yorker, has set for herself in ""The Dinosaur Artist: Obsession, Betrayal and the Quest for Earth's Ultimate Trophy."" What began for her as the tale of an unusual court case involving a rogue fossil hunter unspools in this book into a wide-ranging examination of the ways that commercialism, ambition, politics and science collide. (Just a glance at some of the index's entries reveals the scope: Genghis Khan, Newt Gingrich, St. Augustine, Stegosaurus and Preet Bharara.) When this ""big, sexy"" — and, to paleontologists, obviously illegal — dinosaur appears on the auction block in New York City, commercial and academic worlds alike are aghast. Simply put, the dinosaur is from Mongolia and you can't sell dinosaurs from Mongolia. Behind the stolen bones is Eric Prokopi, who overnight becomes ""either the bravest or most reckless son of a bitch"" other fossil dealers had ever seen. The life of a globe-trotting dinosaur smuggler might bring to mind Thomas Crown meets Tintin, but one of the revelations of the book is just how mundane the skulduggery of Prokopi's crime actually was. He simply went to trade shows, saw who was dealing hot fossils in the open and made contacts. After repeated jaunts across the world to meet with an extremely shady (and often extremely drunken) Mongolian middleman, Prokopi establishes a pipeline for his purloined paleontological finds. As a reader, being given entry by Williams into this underworld, privy to the secret knowledge of a black market, is a thrill. As Prokopi's financial situation becomes increasingly tenuous, these dinosaur bones become his only hope for avoiding ruin. ""A batch of dinosaurs would put everything straight,"" Williams writes at one point, as the noose tightens. It's hard not to feel for Prokopi, who ultimately ends up in prison for his smuggling. The only crime that would seem to separate him from the other dealers who had long peddled hot bones in the open at the Tucson Gem & Mineral Society, and elsewhere, is sheer audacity — that is, flying too close to the sun on the pathetic, undersize forearms of T. bataar. The strange underground world Prokopi inhabits inevitably brings us in contact with some serious oddballs, each of whom is introduced by Williams with the economy and evocative precision of a haiku. In affectless, purposeful prose we get a stream of increasingly strange and piquant factoids about these people, who seem to emerge straight out of a Coen brothers movie: One fossil dealer likes cockroaches, Milton Friedman and Greek triremes. Prokopi's mother is a nudist, while his mentor is a former door-to-door crab salesman who once won a soap-selling contest. The father of a character introduced in the epilogue has a ""love affair"" with a bottlenose dolphin — although, by that point in the book, nothing would seem eccentric enough to warrant surprise. All of this is presented from a narrative God's-eye view, and Williams so skillfully conceals the sausage-making of reporting that when we're told, for instance, what someone was thinking while urinating in the desert in the middle of the night several years ago, we accept it as truth. But where the strange, seedy human world of the dinosaur artist is richly realized, less so is the alien world of the dinosaur at the center of the story itself. There is no introduction to the lost world these monsters stalked, what Mongolia was like 70 million years ago, or how a creature as preposterous as T. bataar ever came to exist on our planet. Besides a few unavoidable references to the creature's specifications and bite strength, for the most part the dinosaur at the center of the story serves the role of MacGuffin. That's because at heart, this is not a book about dinosaurs, it's a book about people; a true-crime book, and a thoroughly reported one at that. It is peppered with useful précis on towering figures from natural history — we join the 19th-century naturalist and savant Mary Anning, for instance, plying the Jurassic Coast for ichthyosaurs, and stand with the father of Deep Time himself, James Hutton, as he stares down the abyss of time represented in an outcrop in Scotland, contemplating the successive layers of earth that created it. But such potted histories are eddies in the narrative stream that carries Eric Prokopi from taciturn Florida high school swim star to eventual bone smuggler and felon. In the end Prokopi, like T. bataar, remains something of a cipher in spite of Williams's nanoscale examination of him, his family, friends, associates, finances, even home décor. Sometimes this intimacy borders on overexposure, though it also produces some arresting vignettes: One of the most effective passages meticulously recounts Prokopi's drive to prison in order to surrender — a trip rendered both comically mundane and dreadful. But Prokopi himself, who doesn't say much and seems constitutionally incapable of showing his cards, remains elusive. Instead, the book's most memorable character may be Mongolia itself, a rugged physical and political terrain that defies easy generalization or the exoticizing accounts of Westerners. We pick up the thread with the mind-blowing global conquests of Genghis Khan and follow it through to the early 20th century, and the accounts of the American naturalist and inveterate self-promoter Roy Chapman Andrews, who briefly descended on Mongolia on behalf of the American Museum of Natural History, forging there a romantic persona as a man committed to digging up dinosaurs. Andrews's life is almost too colorful to recount, and the contributions he made to popular interest in paleontology were real and lasting. But as with many sepia-toned institutional heroes, the luster of his accomplishments has dimmed in retrospect, not least because he minimized the contributions of his Mongolian assistants in service of a queasy American imperialism. In 1932, the Natural History Museum pulled out of the country as Mongolia descended into Stalinist Communism, executing 30,000 intellectuals and Buddhist leaders, eradicating traditional garb, Mongolian vertical script and Khan as a symbol of national pride — all bourgeois indulgences. Sixty years later, when Communism fell, the country was once more flooded with opportunistic Americans, many of them hatched in right-wing American think tanks. It was in the wake of this post-Soviet moment of free-market national ransacking that Prokopi found an opening to extract the country's dinosaur heritage. But just as Khan was suddenly loosed from his symbolic exile and restored as a totem of national pride when Communism fell, when Prokopi falls, hope for a future of Mongolian self-determination comes in the form of a far more ancient, even fiercer symbol of restored national pride: T. bataar."
News,2018-10-01,"TORONTO — More than a celebration, it ended with a huge sigh of relief.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/world/canada/trudeau-nafta-canada.html,1575," TORONTO — More than a celebration, it ended with a huge sigh of relief. Canadians awoke on Monday to the news of a new trade deal with the United States, its largest trading partner, and more important, a reprieve from the threat of crippling auto tariffs that President Trump had been holding over the country for months. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada came away with a few items considered sacred for his nation's economic security: a dispute resolution system for companies that feel unjustly targeted with taxes and a distant expiration date to the agreement. In exchange, Canada promised to crack open its long-protected dairy market — the target of Mr. Trump's Twitter attacks and rally tirades for months — to American competition, a concession that drew immediate anger from politicians in Quebec, home to nearly half of the country's 11,200 dairy farms. At a news conference in Ottawa on Monday, Mr. Trudeau called the agreement ""a good deal,"" although he acknowledged the trade-offs. ""Like any important negotiation, we had to make compromises,"" he said, speaking in French. But, he added, ""today is a good day for Canada."" The agreement does not eliminate the steep tariffs on steel and aluminum that Mr. Trump imposed in the spring. Instead, Mr. Trudeau said his country would continue to negotiate for their removal. ""The great failure of this trade deal was not negotiating an end to the steel and aluminum tariffs,"" said Philip Cross, the former chief economic analyst at Statistics Canada, a government agency, because it tacitly left the door open to Mr. Trump to use the same national protection justification to lay more tariffs in the future, regardless of any trade deal. ""He can invoke national security under this deal and slap tariffs presumably on anything he wants,"" said Mr. Cross, who is now a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a research group based in Ottawa. ""I'm not sure we got the guaranteed secure access to the U.S. that free trade was supposed to give us."" Still, several economists said that although the deal would most likely not bolster the Canadian economy, it was unlikely to hurt it much, either. [Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Subscribe to our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.] The concessions on dairy enraged politicians in Quebec, the country's second-largest province and the center of the dairy industry. All four party leaders vying for votes in the provincial election on Monday rejected the Canadian government's promise of compensation for farmers. ""It is an expression of the systematic injustice that Quebec is suffering within Canada,"" the leader of the separatist Parti Québécois, Jean-François Lisée, told reporters. During much of the negotiations, Mr. Trump had threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on Canadian autos and auto parts crossing into the United States, which would have crippled the Ontario economy, putting an estimated 250,000 people out of work, according to one forecast. It would also have become a potent issue in Mr. Trudeau's re-election campaign next year. The new agreement — which renames the North American Free Trade Agreement as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — neutralizes that threat by effectively exempting Canada's exports to the United States. By requiring 40 percent of auto parts to come from so-called ""high wage factories,"" it could even give unionized Canadian auto manufacturers a leg-up. ""I would argue we are in better shape today than we've been in the last 24 years,"" Jerry Dias, the head of Canada's largest private sector union, Unifor, said on a morning Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio show. ""So I'm absolutely thrilled with where we ended up."" He added: ""Look, we hung tough right to the bitter end. We got what we needed. We didn't fold in the areas that the U.S. wanted us to fold in, so we're in pretty good shape today."" Compared with Mr. Trump, who triumphantly claimed the deal would see ""cash and jobs pouring into the United States and into North America,"" Mr. Trudeau was gracious and understated during his news conference. For him, the deal was more about shoring up the Canadian economy than expanding it. ""We preserved the most important parts of Nafta,'' Mr. Trudeau said. The agreement will be good for the economy, good for workers, he said, and made North America ""a much more stable place than it was yesterday."" Completing the deal capped what had been an exhausting and turbulent process for the prime minister who, with the election looming, had at times appeared vulnerable and stumbling beneath a shower of insults from Mr. Trump. Many thought Mr. Trudeau was in an impossible position — trying to get a deal he could sell as good for his country, and maintaining his dignity when dealing with the unpredictable Mr. Trump. The test for Mr. Trudeau, who faces an election next year, will be whether he can persuade voters that Nafta 2.0 is a ""win-win-win,"" as he has long assured them it would be. ""Justin Trudeau has to take the high ground on this fairly quickly,"" said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, a nonprofit polling organization based in Vancouver. ""Can he sell the deal?"" Almost from the beginning of his candidacy for president, Mr. Trump has criticized Nafta, and especially the provisions relating to Canada — a drumbeat that has not let up. That added additional drama to the negotiations, which Canadians have followed with the rapt attention normally reserved for hockey playoffs. Despite harboring a deepening dislike for Mr. Trump, Canadians largely accept that the country cannot survive economically without its larger, more powerful neighbor. Almost three-quarters of Canada's exports flow south across the border. As negotiations reached their final stages last week, Canadians were riveted by the spectacle of the hearings for the nomination of a United States Supreme Court justice, which drowned out most trade news on Friday. The polarization of American politics, the uncertainty of what kind of trade deal Congress would accept and how the midterm elections in the United States would change things has made most Canadians throw up their hands in exasperation. Then there was Mr. Trump, who to Canadians seems immune to fact; approaches every deal as a tug-of-war; and has taken to insulting the United States' longstanding ally and neighbor publicly. ""He's weaponized uncertainty,"" said John Higginbotham, a senior fellow at Carleton University in Ottawa who was the second-highest-ranking Canadian diplomat in Washington for six years. ""You can't call his bluff with impunity,"" he added. ""He's not playacting, he's a bit crazy. He is a bit crazy."" Just last week, Mr. Trump said that he did not like Canada's representative — presumably referring to Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland — ""very much,"" and that he had purposely snubbed Mr. Trudeau, by refusing to meet with him at the United Nations. (Mr. Trudeau's office said no request for a meeting was ever made.) Nafta negotiations began more than a year ago, with Mr. Trudeau saying he wanted an agreement that would be good for Canadian workers but also include climate change provisions and new chapters on gender and indigenous rights. Mr. Trudeau deployed an army of charmers across the border to build alliances with people around Mr. Trump. Known as the doughnut strategy, the campaign seemed to be working. But in May, two days after a deal on Nafta looked close, the Trump administration announced it would proceed with steep tariffs on steel and aluminum. The Canadian government countered with tariffs on $12.6 billion of American imports. Since then, the relationship between the two countries — and the two leaders — has further soured. In June, at the end of a two-day Group of 7 summit meeting in Charlevoix, Quebec, Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference that Canada would not be bullied on trade. ""As Canadians,"" he said, ""we are polite, we're reasonable, but also we will not be pushed around."" Mr. Trump erupted in anger from Air Force One, en route to his summit meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. He wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trudeau was ""very dishonest and weak"" and accused him of making false statements. Canadians rose up in defense of Mr. Trudeau, whose approval rating surged to 70 percent in a number of polls. Even his political enemies lined up behind him. Canadians canceled trips across the border and began personal boycotts of American goods in protest. Then, in late August, Mr. Trudeau received another rude shock when the American and Mexican presidents signed a deal without him. Some thought Mr. Trudeau was outmatched by Mr. Trump. ""There was some illusion that sending a couple progressive people from the prime minister's office to see Ivanka, that would solve the problem,"" said Mr. Higginbotham, referring to the president's elder daughter. But many Canadians believe the American administration has not been negotiating in good faith — a position supported by Mr. Trump telling Bloomberg last month that any deal with Canada would be ""totally on our terms."" And most agreed that Mr. Trudeau and his foreign minister, Ms. Freeland, had been put in tricky positions. ""I'm not sure they had a lot of choice,"" said Don Campbell, a former Canadian ambassador and high-level government official who was involved in setting up the first iteration of Nafta. ""They are dealing with an unprecedented situation, with a president who is not rational or consistent in his approach, who disregards facts and who does not tell the truth,"" he said."
Interactive Feature,2018-10-02,"The midterm elections are around the corner. If you haven’t been keeping up with what’s going on, or have been and are still confused, take a look at our cheat sheet.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/2018-midterm-election-guide.html,0," TORONTO — More than a celebration, it ended with a huge sigh of relief. Canadians awoke on Monday to the news of a new trade deal with the United States, its largest trading partner, and more important, a reprieve from the threat of crippling auto tariffs that President Trump had been holding over the country for months. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada came away with a few items considered sacred for his nation's economic security: a dispute resolution system for companies that feel unjustly targeted with taxes and a distant expiration date to the agreement. In exchange, Canada promised to crack open its long-protected dairy market — the target of Mr. Trump's Twitter attacks and rally tirades for months — to American competition, a concession that drew immediate anger from politicians in Quebec, home to nearly half of the country's 11,200 dairy farms. At a news conference in Ottawa on Monday, Mr. Trudeau called the agreement ""a good deal,"" although he acknowledged the trade-offs. ""Like any important negotiation, we had to make compromises,"" he said, speaking in French. But, he added, ""today is a good day for Canada."" The agreement does not eliminate the steep tariffs on steel and aluminum that Mr. Trump imposed in the spring. Instead, Mr. Trudeau said his country would continue to negotiate for their removal. ""The great failure of this trade deal was not negotiating an end to the steel and aluminum tariffs,"" said Philip Cross, the former chief economic analyst at Statistics Canada, a government agency, because it tacitly left the door open to Mr. Trump to use the same national protection justification to lay more tariffs in the future, regardless of any trade deal. ""He can invoke national security under this deal and slap tariffs presumably on anything he wants,"" said Mr. Cross, who is now a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a research group based in Ottawa. ""I'm not sure we got the guaranteed secure access to the U.S. that free trade was supposed to give us."" Still, several economists said that although the deal would most likely not bolster the Canadian economy, it was unlikely to hurt it much, either. [Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Subscribe to our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.] The concessions on dairy enraged politicians in Quebec, the country's second-largest province and the center of the dairy industry. All four party leaders vying for votes in the provincial election on Monday rejected the Canadian government's promise of compensation for farmers. ""It is an expression of the systematic injustice that Quebec is suffering within Canada,"" the leader of the separatist Parti Québécois, Jean-François Lisée, told reporters. During much of the negotiations, Mr. Trump had threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on Canadian autos and auto parts crossing into the United States, which would have crippled the Ontario economy, putting an estimated 250,000 people out of work, according to one forecast. It would also have become a potent issue in Mr. Trudeau's re-election campaign next year. The new agreement — which renames the North American Free Trade Agreement as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — neutralizes that threat by effectively exempting Canada's exports to the United States. By requiring 40 percent of auto parts to come from so-called ""high wage factories,"" it could even give unionized Canadian auto manufacturers a leg-up. ""I would argue we are in better shape today than we've been in the last 24 years,"" Jerry Dias, the head of Canada's largest private sector union, Unifor, said on a morning Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio show. ""So I'm absolutely thrilled with where we ended up."" He added: ""Look, we hung tough right to the bitter end. We got what we needed. We didn't fold in the areas that the U.S. wanted us to fold in, so we're in pretty good shape today."" Compared with Mr. Trump, who triumphantly claimed the deal would see ""cash and jobs pouring into the United States and into North America,"" Mr. Trudeau was gracious and understated during his news conference. For him, the deal was more about shoring up the Canadian economy than expanding it. ""We preserved the most important parts of Nafta,'' Mr. Trudeau said. The agreement will be good for the economy, good for workers, he said, and made North America ""a much more stable place than it was yesterday.""

News,2018-10-02,Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/business/dealbook/fresenius-akorn-delaware.html,396," Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Merger escape clauses are notoriously hard to trigger, but a judge has allowed Germany's Fresenius to nix its $4.75 billion deal to acquire the fellow drug maker Akorn. Don't expect many copycats. The case included misconduct claims, but even so it may be overturned: Corporate-friendly Delaware courts are loath to second-guess contracts. The American generic-drug maker Akorn went into a tailspin after Fresenius agreed to buy it in early 2017. Akorn had predicted annual revenue of more than $1 billion and nearly $350 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. By the end of the year, the firm had chalked up $841 million of sales, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization fell 80 percent below its projection. What mattered was the root of this shortfall. Fresenius claimed that Akorn made misrepresentations when it claimed to be in compliance with Food and Drug Administration regulations and making progress in fixing manufacturing shortfalls. In particular, Fresenius said that Akorn had been sloppy with — or, worse, fabricated — the data that underlies F.D.A. drug approvals. The judge agreed. He stated that Akorn's representations were not ""true and correct, and the magnitude of the inaccuracies would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect."" Fresenius was free to walk away, and the news sent Akorn shares tumbling more than 50 percent. Lawyers can no longer say that Delaware has never allowed a material adverse change clause to invalidate a deal — but in practice it's doubtful that much has changed. Bad results aren't sufficient to let companies wriggle out of deals. The economy is cyclical, some industries more so, and rivals may introduce superior technology that renders a company worthless. These are not good reasons to invalidate a contract. Judge Travis Laster decided that it was the combination of multiple serious misrepresentations and an adverse change in Akorn's business that allowed Fresenius to exit. Akorn is appealing, and the verdict may yet be overturned. Delaware has become the most popular place for big American companies to incorporate for a reason. The law is favorable to them, justice moves relatively quickly in specialized cases, and contracts are upheld. The courts will probably prefer to keep a high bar when it comes to invalidating deals."
News,2018-10-02,"BOSTON — Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Tuesday that the American economy is enjoying an unusual but sustainable period of low unemployment and low inflation. He described the current moment, and the Fed’s expectation that it will continue, as “not too good to be true.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/business/jerome-powell-fed-economic-outlook.html,869," BOSTON — Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Tuesday that the American economy is enjoying an unusual but sustainable period of low unemployment and low inflation. He described the current moment, and the Fed's expectation that it will continue, as ""not too good to be true."" Inflation is hovering around the 2 percent annual pace that the central bank regards as optimal while the unemployment rate has remained close to 4 percent for the last year. Economists have long regarded low unemployment as a harbinger of higher inflation, and there is no precedent in modern American history for both economic indicators to remain at such low levels. But Mr. Powell said there was reason to believe this time could be different. He said the Fed's success in holding down inflation in recent decades has reinforced public expectations that inflation would stay low, and that, in turn, is helping to keep inflation low. ""These developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation,"" Mr. Powell said on Tuesday in Boston at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics. Mr. Powell, speaking a few hours after Amazon announced it would raise its entry-level wage to $15 an hour, said evidence of increased wage growth is ""quite welcome."" The Fed chairman's remarks are likely to resonate with Trump administration officials, who insist that faster economic growth is sustainable. ""I'm in favor of higher wages,"" Larry Kudlow, the president's chief economic adviser, told reporters on Tuesday after Amazon's announcement. ""More people working and prospering — you've heard me say this before — is not inflationary. It's a good thing, not a bad thing."" Fed officials have long assumed inflation and unemployment sit on opposite ends of a seesaw: As unemployment falls, inflation tends to rise; as unemployment rises, inflation tends to fall. That model, known as the Phillips curve, accurately described the relationship between inflation and unemployment in the middle of the 20th century. But the volatility of inflation has diminished in recent decades. As unemployment has swelled and subsided, inflation has remained low and steady. Mr. Powell said Tuesday that the relationship has been weakened by the Fed's success in controlling inflation, which has instilled confidence that the Fed will continue to control inflation. As a result, even when unemployment falls, investors are not as quick to build higher inflation expectations into asset prices. ""Many factors, including better conduct of monetary policy over the past few decades, have greatly reduced but not eliminated the effects that tight labor markets have on inflation,"" Mr. Powell said. Mr. Powell's view suggests that inflation is unlikely to rise quickly even as the labor market continues to tighten. Between August 2017 and August 2018, the most recent available data, average hourly wages increased by 2.9 percent, although, adjusting for inflation, the increase was just 0.2 percent, federal data shows. The government will release September wage data on Friday. While the Fed sees little slack in the economy, Mr. Powell said he did not see wage growth as an indication that the economy was beginning to overheat since wages were rising in line with inflation and productivity. Even if wage growth began to outpace inflation and productivity, Mr. Powell said it still might not foretell faster inflation, pointing to the example of the 1990s. ""The key is anchored expectations"" for stable inflation, Mr. Powell said. He added, however, that the Fed would remain watchful. ""Common sense suggests we should beware when forecasts predict events seldom before observed in the economy,"" he said. The Fed is raising interest rates slowly and steadily, which Mr. Powell described as a form of risk management. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate in September for the third time this year, into a range between 2 and 2.25 percent. Another quarter-point increase is expected in December. Mr. Powell said that the Fed was raising rates because it might be wrong about the dangers of inflation, but that it was moving slowly because it did not want to impede or end economic growth. ""Our ongoing policy of gradual interest rate normalization reflects our efforts to balance the inevitable risks that come with extraordinary times, so as to extend the current expansion, while maintaining maximum employment and low and stable inflation,"" Mr. Powell said. During a question-and-answer session, Mr. Powell was asked about the economic effects of the Trump administration's tax cuts and trade policies. He said that the tax cuts had provided a short-term boost to growth, but that it was too early to tell whether the cuts would encourage investment that might increase growth in the longer term. On trade restrictions, he said that the Fed did not yet see evidence of any broad economic effect, but that it was probably too early to judge the effects. Mr. Powell said the Fed also was paying attention to the economic performance of the rest of the world. The recovery in other developed nations has lagged behind that of the United States, but Mr. Powell said the overall picture remained ""reasonably positive."" ""I think growth is still healthy, but maybe under a little pressure,"" he said."

As his speech reached a climax, there were uncontrolled whoops of joy. Like him or loathe him — and there are many in both camps — it was impossible to ignore Mr. Johnson, whose appearance on Tuesday at the Conservative Party's annual conference overshadowed an announcement on immigration policy from the person whose job he so obviously craves: Prime Minister Theresa May. But there also seemed to be an element of desperation beneath Mr. Johnson's ill-disguised ambition. ""He's aware that his political tide is seeping away,"" said Richard Hayton, an associate professor of politics at the University of Leeds. ""If he doesn't get the leadership in the aftermath of what will happen over Brexit in the next few months, it will pass him by for a new generation."" Mr. Johnson made a damning, if familiar, attack on Mrs. May's plan for Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, known as Brexit — a blueprint that would keep some close economic ties to the bloc to minimize disruption to trade and protect the economy. A leader of the victorious pro-Brexit referendum campaign, Mr. Johnson favors a cleaner, more brutal break, and his speech appeared calculated to deepen a split within the Conservative Party that threatens to unseat Mrs. May and wreck her government. Her proposals — called the Chequers plan after the country residence where they were forged — are dangerous, unstable, an outrage and a cheat, and they amount to a political humiliation, Mr. Johnson said. ""This is not taking back control, it is forfeiting control,"" said Mr. Johnson, who suggested that the prime minister's plan would leave Britain to be, metaphorically, ""paraded in manacles"" down one of the main avenues of Brussels, like Caratacus, a British chieftain who led the resistance to the Roman conquest. Eloquent, charismatic and utterly incorrigible, Mr. Johnson is one of the best-known personalities in British politics, famous for his ruffled hair and his flair for both the English language and publicity. Six months ago Mr. Johnson seemed a beleaguered figure as foreign secretary, one of the biggest jobs in government but one that also exposed some of his shortcomings as a politician. However, his resignation from the cabinet over the Chequers plan has revived his popularity in the hard-line, pro-Brexit faction of the party. Recently, he almost seemed to be auditioning for the role of Britain's Donald Trump — whose negotiating skills he has compared favorably with those of Mrs. May — likening Muslim women who wear burqas to mailboxes and seeming to make common cause with Steve Bannon, the former White House strategist who is a champion of right-wing populism. The idea, analysts say, is to nail down the Brexit supporters within the Conservative Party, which could be decisive in any intraparty vote for the next party leader, who would then become prime minister. Party members are disproportionately older and in favor of Brexit. ""There isn't a unifying 'leave' figure and they want to be able to unite behind a candidate, so there is some political space for Boris,"" Mr. Hayton said. On Tuesday Mr. Johnson's speech overshadowed an announcement from Mrs. May and her home secretary, Sajid Javid, that after Brexit, a new plan would remove favorable immigration status for European Union citizens. Mr. Javid also called for a crackdown on middle-class drug users. Predictably, though, it was Mr. Johnson who dominated the headlines even if there was no hint from him of any imminent bid for the leadership. That suggests that Mr. Johnson thinks that the crisis over Brexit needs to gather pace before a challenge against Mrs. May could succeed. Still, there is no guarantee that Mr. Johnson would win a leadership fight. Some colleagues suspect that he adopted the Brexit cause not so much from conviction as to increase his prospects of becoming party leader. Many fellow Conservative lawmakers are scathing about him. In an interview with The Daily Mail, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, dismissed Mr. Johnson as a man unable to grasp detail and predicted that he would never become prime minister. On Tuesday, David Gauke, the justice secretary, told the BBC that while Mr. Johnson ""always attracts lots of attention,"" it was time for the ""credible and serious leadership"" that Mrs. May offers. ""The question is whether there is just too much anger among colleagues to see him get anywhere near the leadership,"" said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College London, referring to Mr. Johnson. Others fancy their chances, too, and the party conference has been something of a beauty contest among potential successors to Mrs. May, whose leadership has been in question since she lost her parliamentary majority last year. Possible contenders include Mr. Javid, Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary. Although she insists she does not want the job, Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives and a gay mother-to-be, has emerged as a potential leader who could change perceptions of a party that frets about its chronic lack of appeal to younger voters. However, it is unwise to underestimate Mr. Johnson, whose star quality still marks him out in a field of mainly drab competitors. And if nothing else, Mr. Johnson's ruthless courtship of the party's right wing has shaped the debate over the succession to Mrs. May, encouraging other contenders to ratchet up their anti-European rhetoric to win support from Euroskeptic activists. That may explain some jarring comments from Mr. Hunt — Mr. Johnson's successor as foreign secretary — who compared the European Union to the Soviet Union. Reactions to those remarks included one from Vytenis Andriukaitis, a European Commission member from Lithuania, who offered to explain the differences between the two entities from the standpoint of someone who works in Brussels and was born in a Soviet gulag."

Obituary (Obit),2018-10-02,"Do Muoi, a Vietnamese revolutionary who served for six years as the country’s leader during its transition to a market economy under a Communist government, died on Monday in Hanoi. He was 101.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/obituaries/do-muoi-vietnams-leader-in-economic-transition-dies-at-101.html,644," Do Muoi, a Vietnamese revolutionary who served for six years as the country's leader during its transition to a market economy under a Communist government, died on Monday in Hanoi. He was 101. His death, at the National Military Hospital, was announced by the government. ""Comrade Do Muoi had gone through various working positions and made great contributions to the revolutionary cause of the Party and nation,"" the announcement said. Mr. Do Muoi was the Communist Party's general secretary from 1991 to 1997. One Vietnamese news report of his death called him ""a prime example of a steadfast communist."" But he also pushed through difficult economic reforms in the wake of Vietnam's disastrous attempt to impose a command economy after the Vietnam War ended in 1975. Mr. Do Muoi was general secretary during the crucial years of Vietnam's transition from communism to the economic liberalization called ""doi moi,"" generally translated as ""renovation,"" which unleashed a burst of pent-up energy in free enterprise. In a process known in China as ""peaceful evolution,"" Vietnam hesitantly opened its markets and encouraged free enterprise while maintaining the party's grip on political and economic affairs. At a party congress in 1996, when he was named to a second term as general secretary, Mr. Do Muoi spoke to foreign reporters of the need to accelerate economic reforms while maintaining party control. ""Slow development means hunger, don't you think?"" he said. ""But at the same time, I want to see efficiency and stability."" He added: ""If reform is too fast, we will make mistakes. If you run too fast and there is something in the road, you may fall down."" At the time, 80 percent of Vietnam's mostly rural population of 75 million remained poor. In addition to economic reforms, the government was preoccupied with endemic corruption, which has resisted repeated campaigns for reform. ""As long as governments exist, corruption will exist,"" Mr. Do Muoi said. ""It is an illness of government, and it can be cured only by the people. It will be severely punished, even by execution, no matter what position the person was holding."" Born Nguyen Duy Cong in 1917 in Hanoi, Mr. Do Muoi joined the movement to oust French colonial rule when he was 19. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1939. He described his family as ""poor for many generations."" His official biography makes no mention of formal education. Information about survivors was not released. In 1941 Mr. Do Muoi was arrested by the French and sentenced to 10 years in prison in Hanoi. He escaped four years later and rejoined the revolution. He rose through the ranks of the party and the government and joined the ruling Politburo in 1982. He was appointed prime minister in 1988 before being elevated to general secretary of the party three years later. He was the last member of the wartime old guard to hold a top leadership post. Since he left office Vietnam has been in the hands of men who came of age after the war. Because of a deadlock in the succession when his first term came to an end, his tenure was briefly extended in 1996, delaying the transition to a new generation of leaders. At the time, the average age of the 170-member central committee was 65. Mr. Do Muoi was buoyant about his new lease on life when he spoke to reporters during a lull in the party meeting that voted him a second term. ""They will not let me rest!"" he said happily as a clutch of foreign reporters surrounded him. ""I am almost 80 and I am still young!"" As if to demonstrate his youth and vigor, he lavished special attention on a young female reporter. ""Are you married?"" he said when she asked a question about party politics. ""Would you like to have a Vietnamese husband?"""
briefing,2018-10-02,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/briefing/indonesia-china-president-trump.html,1323," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Mass burials in Indonesia, a near-collision in the South China Sea, President Trump's inheritance. Here's what you need to know: • A mass burial every day in Indonesia. The death toll on Sulawesi rose to at least 1,234 people, according to officials, as the island continued to reckon with a powerful earthquake and tsunami. Thousands of government workers, including the military and the police, are pitching in to rescue survivors and evacuate them from disaster zones. Rescue workers are also burying truckloads of bodies, in what has become a daily ritual. Before and after images show how the disaster flattened parts of the island. Here's how you can help the survivors. _____ • President Trump's inherited fortune. ""I built what I built myself,"" Mr. Trump has often said. But a special Times investigation, based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records, has found that his fortune is deeply connected to the riches of his father, the New York City builder Fred Trump. Above, father and son. Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year from his father's empire by age 3. He was a millionaire by age 8. He received at least $413 million in today's dollars from his father in total. Much of the money he received as an adult came from helping his parents dodge taxes — setting up sham corporations, filing improper deductions and even undervaluing real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars, records and interviews show. Some schemes were outright fraud, the investigation found. Here are 11 takeaways. A lawyer for Mr. Trump called the findings ""100 percent false, and highly defamatory."" Read his full statement. _____ • China ruffles feathers overseas. Warships from the U.S. and China came perilously close to colliding in the disputed South China Sea. The near-accident occurred by a reef that Beijing has expanded and militarized. The Pentagon said the Chinese Navy used an ""unsafe and unprofessional maneuver"" to challenge the American ship; Chinese officials said the U.S. threatened ""China's sovereignty and security."" Separately, a reporter from China's state-run international broadcaster started shouting at a speaker criticizing China at Britain's Conservative Party annual conference. She then slapped the people who were trying to escort her out. At home, a snazzy TV quiz show is encouraging millennials to take an interest in the life and ideology of President Xi Jinping. _____ • The Kavanaugh inquiry expands. The White House authorized the F.B.I. to expand its investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against the Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Here's a list of who it might interview. At the same time, Democrats trying to derail Mr. Kavanaugh's nomination have a new avenue of attack: questioning the judge's temperament and honesty. What is going on in the U.S.? We've created a new newsletter — Abroad in America — to help foreign readers untangle what's happening in the U.S. ahead of the midterm elections. _____ • Tesla nearly doubled production of its more affordable Model 3 cars in the third quarter. But the rare bit of good news wasn't enough to please investors and its shares were down. • President Trump claimed his new Nafta deal with Mexico and Canada vindicated his aggressive use of tariffs, and he vowed to keep playing hardball with Japan and the E.U. But the president stopped short of promising to reach a deal with China. • Amazon will raise the minimum wage to $15 for all its U.S. workers, including part-time and holiday workers as well as employees of Whole Foods, the retailer announced today. • U.S. stocks were mixed.

In 1911, this honor went to Marie Curie, above, for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. She was the first woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize. It was her second Nobel: In 1903 she shared the physics prize with her husband and another French scientist for their work on radioactivity. Marie Curie came from humble beginnings. Born Maria Sklodowska in Poland in 1867, she was the youngest of five children. She once summed up her biography in just 21 words: ""I was born in Poland. I married Pierre Curie, and I have two daughters. I have done my work in France."" Marie Curie died in 1934 as a result of exposure to radioactivity, some of it incurred while preparing radium for medical use. She has been the topic of many books and movies. A recent BBC poll deemed her the most influential woman in history. ""Few persons contributed more to the general welfare of mankind and to the advancement of science than the modest, self-effacing woman whom the world knew as Mme. Curie,"" The New York Times wrote after her death. Honors were heaped upon her, our obituary stated, but ""she was indifferent to most.""

Obituary (Obit),2018-10-02,"Lois S. Gray, who as a professor and mentor for seven decades delivered college-trained women, immigrants and members of racial and ethnic minority groups into the ranks of American organized labor, died on Sept. 20 in Manhattan. She was 94.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/obituaries/lois-gray-dead.html,676," Lois S. Gray, who as a professor and mentor for seven decades delivered college-trained women, immigrants and members of racial and ethnic minority groups into the ranks of American organized labor, died on Sept. 20 in Manhattan. She was 94. Bonnie Beavers, a niece, confirmed her death. Professor Gray joined the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University in 1946, barely a year after it was founded. She started out as a member of the extension faculty, which reached out to employees and would-be union leaders to educate them in collective bargaining, job training and other programs intended to improve workplace conditions. Over the next 57 years, she directed the school's first extension office, in Buffalo, and its metropolitan district office in New York City. As a researcher, author and editor of several books, and as a member of New York State employment and training task forces, Professor Gray remained versed in the latest technological, competitive and political challenges facing both labor and management. Until her death, she met several days a week with students and faculty in the school's Manhattan office. ""Lois blazed the trail for the university to venture into the tumultuous real world of industrial and labor relations,"" said Lou Jean Fleron, who directs the High Road Fellowship program for undergraduates at Cornell in Buffalo. ""She made education a tool for improving the workplace and advancing a democratic economy through collective bargaining and fair collaboration."" Professor Gray personally donated $1 million to the school's Worker Institute, which conducts research and offers education programs on labor issues. She also funded an internship program in memory of her husband, Edward Gray, who was a regional director and member of the international executive board of the United Automobile Workers union. He died in 1995. In addition to her niece, Bonnie, she is survived by her nephew, Dr. Bruce Beavers; her stepson, John T. Gray; three step-grandchildren; eight step-great-grandchildren; and five step-great-great-grandchildren. Professor Gray's grounding in social justice began when she was a child growing up in Oklahoma in the 1930s on the fringes of the Dust Bowl, where her mother handed out food to migrant workers and her father's sermons against racism provoked a Ku Klux Klan cross-burning on the lawn of the parsonage in which the family lived. Lois Faye Spier was born on Oct. 17, 1923, in St. Louis to Charles and Mae (Imboden) Spier. Her father was studying at the time at Union Theological Seminary in New York, where the family moved when Lois was a baby. She was reared in Edmond, Okla., near Oklahoma City, where her father was minister of the First Presbyterian Church. She earned a scholarship to Northwestern University, where she majored in drama. After her father enlisted in the military during World War II, she transferred to live closer to her mother and sister and graduated from Park College (now Park University) in Parkville, Mo., in 1943 with a bachelor's degree in economics. She also won first prize in a national debate contest on the topic of government regulation of unions. During the war she was recruited by a military intelligence unit in Washington, then became a field examiner for the National Labor Relations Board in Buffalo, where she earned her master's degree from the University of Buffalo (now the University at Buffalo of the State University of New York). A year later, after she inquired about pursuing another graduate degree at the new Industrial and Labor Relations School at Cornell, she was offered a position on the faculty there. She moved to New York City in 1956 to direct the extension school's metropolitan program and earned a doctorate at Columbia University, where she studied under the Nobel-winning economist Gary Becker. She was named associate dean and director of extension in 1976. She lived in Manhattan. Under Professor Gray's leadership, the school established the Institute for Women and Work, the Latino Leadership Center, an international worker exchange, and off-campus credit courses for workers and union leaders. She retired as a professor emerita of labor management relations."
News,2018-10-02,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/us/politics/on-politics-with-lisa-lerer-war-of-the-sexes.html,1492," Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] The fight over Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh was supposed to be about a seat on the Supreme Court. But the past two weeks have transformed that discrete political battle into something far larger: A simmering war of the sexes that's deepening the divide between Democratic women and Republican men. These are tensions that have been mounting since before the 2016 campaign. Political scientists have found that over the last decade or so, support for feminism, from both men and women, has been increasingly correlated with support for Democrats. The battle over Judge Kavanaugh is perhaps our starkest reflection of that new political reality. Let's think through these new dynamics with a little thought experiment: • A prominent Democratic woman becomes the front-runner for the nomination in 2020. How do her male rivals attack her? How do they convince female voters that they're a better face for the party? • This same woman wins the nomination. She's up against President Trump. How does that contest become anything but a circus? • A woman comes forward with a highly credible accusation of sexual abuse against a top political leader. It's true. Who has the credibility to litigate that, politically? And can you convince Republicans? • A woman comes forward with a highly credible accusation of sexual abuse. It's not true. Who has the credibility to litigate that? And can you convince Democrats? In a twist that will surprise no one, both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton addressed the confirmation battle in public appearances today, just an hour or so apart. (Yes, we're all caught in an episode of Black Mirror where we can never, ever escape the 2016 election. Just accept it. It's easier that way.) When asked by reporters if he had a message for men, Mr. Trump said: ""It's a very scary time for young men in America, when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of. This is a very, very — this is a very difficult time. What's happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of a Supreme Court justice."" It's an argument — articulated loudly during last week's hearing by Senator Lindsey Graham — that has been gaining traction in the Republican Party since Mr. Trump's win. We know from polling that a higher percentage of Trump backers believe white men face discrimination. Mrs. Clinton had a different take, one that reflects the thinking of many in her party. ""I think what is happening is that on many many fronts, women, young women and girls, are saying, 'You have to hear our stories, too. We have the right to be heard,'"" she said, speaking at an event hosted by The Atlantic magazine. ""I don't see it so much as some kind of conflict, as finally righting the balance."" Many women found something deeply recognizable in Christine Blasey Ford's testimony. They are sharing their own experiences of sexual assault — and becoming more radical in how they're doing so, as seen the video of the confrontation with Senator Jeff Flake last week. Judge Kavanaguh's approval ratings are  sinking — a decline attributable to independent women. Meanwhile, the F.B.I. is investigating, trying to figure out what actually happened on that summer night so many decades ago. It's hard to imagine a conclusive ending. The reality is that both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey could be telling their truths. Maybe one is misremembering what happened. Maybe one is lying. It almost doesn't matter. The universality of their interaction — both for men and women — has tapped into something that's not likely to be resolved with a Senate vote. ____________________ We published a really great guide to the midterms today, called ""Everything You Need to Know for the Midterm Elections."" But we still had questions! So we reached out to political reporter Matt Flegenheimer, who wrote the report, for more. We talked on Slack, which is the way a lot of conversations tend to happen at The New York Times. Lisa [12:13 PM] Hey! So we loved your election guide today. Helpful! But for real, what are the questions people ask you about the midterms? It can't be where to vote... Matt [12:15 PM] Only occasionally! But my knowledge is limited to northwest D.C., if that. I mean, everyone wants to know who's going to win, right? And they want certainty, which is pretty dicey. For all the talk lamenting ""horse race"" coverage of politics, the question I get most often, by far, is... who's going to win the race? Lisa [12:17 PM] What do you tell them? I totally dodge that one. Always. After the 2016 situation, I'm SO out of the prediction business... Matt [12:20 PM] Dodging is key. Don't you wind up feeling like a politician sometimes? ""Well, there are very compelling arguments on both sides..."" I guess I try to walk people through the factors that would suggest a good year for Dems (serious intensity, an aggressive House map) and others that could boost Republicans (the strong economy, a favorable Senate map). This rarely satisfies anyone. Lisa [12:24 PM] I am unsatisfied! The other big one I get is Will Trump Be Impeached? Typically asked with a lot of emotion/yelling. My take on that is that if Democrats win the House, the chances go up. But not much. It still seems like such a long shot, given that 2/3 of the Senate would have to vote for it. Matt [12:26 PM] Totally. And some left-leaning readers seem to have VERY high expectations for this (and the special counsel investigation) that don't necessarily match up with the likeliest scenario. This vision of Robert Mueller dragging Trump from the Oval in handcuffs while delivering an Aaron Sorkin monologue seems... unlikely. Lisa [12:30 PM] I wonder if Robert Mueller is that poetic? I feel like we only ever see him walking down hallways with a very purposeful gait. Anyhow, give us one more question you get and we'll call it an afternoon. Matt [12:31 PM] There is poetry in meaningful walking. The specific race that everyone asks about is Texas — partly because I've covered it — but that's one that really seems to have broken through well beyond the state itself. ""Can Beto really win?"" ""Is Cruz actually sweating this?"" Yes! And yes! And that should not be confused with a prediction that it'll actually happen. #anotherdodge Lisa [12:34 PM] Thanks, Fleg. That was fun. Let's do it again sometime? Maybe before Nov. 6? Matt [12:35 PM] For sure. Or we do it Nov. 7 and pretend we nailed every prediction. Lisa [12:36 PM] Win!

News,2018-10-02,"MIRAMAR, Fla. — The rancorous tone of one of the country’s most closely contested Senate races turned more hostile on Tuesday as Senator Bill Nelson of Florida cast his opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, as an untrustworthy liar in their first debate, while Mr. Scott portrayed Mr. Nelson as an ineffective failure.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/us/debate-rick-scott-bill-nelson-florida.html,1089," MIRAMAR, Fla. — The rancorous tone of one of the country's most closely contested Senate races turned more hostile on Tuesday as Senator Bill Nelson of Florida cast his opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, as an untrustworthy liar in their first debate, while Mr. Scott portrayed Mr. Nelson as an ineffective failure. In an hourlong exchange aimed at the state's crucial Latino voters, Mr. Scott, a Republican, and Mr. Nelson, a Democrat, sharply disagreed on their records on Puerto Rico, immigration and health care. But almost every one of their answers invariably returned to their prepared lines of attack. ""The governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another,"" Mr. Nelson said after Mr. Scott accused him of liking high taxes. ""Apparently you never got your mouth washed out with soap after telling a lie."" After Mr. Nelson spoke of his efforts for comprehensive immigration reform, Mr. Scott noted that the senator was in office when Democrats controlled the White House, Senate and House of Representatives. ""Congress has failed to act, failed to act, failed to act,"" Mr. Scott said. ""He never got anything done."" Polls show the race effectively tied with a little more than a month left until Election Day, although the most recent surveys suggest that Mr. Nelson, 76, has pulled slightly ahead. He trailed Mr. Scott, 65, at the outset, as the governor, a wealthy former health care executive, spent millions of dollars early on televised political advertising. On Tuesday, local elections supervisors began sending mail-in ballots to voters who requested them. The debate showed that Mr. Scott continues to approach the competitive race as an underdog, despite his broad name recognition and financial advantage. He delivered forceful responses to questions even when they did not play to his chief strength, the economy. Mr. Nelson seemed at ease, with a steady, deliberate performance, though he appeared to miss opportunities to tie the governor to President Trump. The debate, taped at the studios of Miami's Telemundo affiliate, was unexpectedly lively for two candidates who are not known for their political charisma. That they had rehearsed crisp responses was apparent all the way to the end, when both men delivered prepared closing statements in passable Spanish. They are scheduled to debate only once more, on Oct. 16 in Tampa. A question about Mr. Trump's embattled nominee to the United States Supreme Court, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, prompted Mr. Nelson to say he found Christine Blasey Ford's testimony last week ""quite compelling."" Dr. Ford said she was sexually assaulted years ago by Mr. Kavanaugh, who has forcefully denied the accusation. ""And she was doing that in front of 11 Republican men that seemed to dismiss it,"" he said. Mr. Scott voiced support for the judge, accusing Mr. Nelson of partisanship for failing to focus on abuse and assault allegations against Democrats like Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, and criticizing Mr. Kavanaugh's confirmation process. ""The way the U.S. Senate has handled this, it's a circus,"" Mr. Scott said. ""It's more like a 'Jerry Springer Show.' Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh are just pawns in some political game."" Mr. Scott, who was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014 with a relentless jobs message, has kept the Senate race close in part thanks to his direct appeals to Hispanic voters, and not only to Cuban-Americans in South Florida who lean Republican. He has also made repeated outreach to non-Cuban Hispanics, especially Puerto Ricans in Central Florida who tend to vote Democratic but are generally grateful to the governor for his visible presence on the island after Hurricane Maria last year. Still, it was Mr. Nelson who won the endorsement on Monday of Puerto Rico's governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, who called Mr. Scott a friend but said Mr. Nelson had been helpful to the island even before the hurricane. On Tuesday, Mr. Nelson vaunted Mr. Rosselló's support and slammed the Trump administration's Maria response, referring to the day when Mr. Trump tossed paper towels to storm victims, a gesture that many Puerto Ricans found distasteful in the wake of the disaster. ""He said, quote, 'I would not have done anything differently,'"" Mr. Nelson said of Mr. Scott. ""Distancing yourself from President Trump — would that guarantee the Puerto Rican vote in Florida?"" Jackie Nespral, a debate moderator from the local NBC affiliate, asked Mr. Scott. ""I don't think of politics that way,"" he said. ""I think about, how do you help families? Whether they're in Puerto Rico, whether they came here, or whether they went back, my job is to be a full-service governor."" Mr. Scott was careful not to invoke Mr. Trump, who polls show remains deeply unpopular among Puerto Ricans. Surprisingly, however, Mr. Nelson also did not mention the president by name, though in campaign ads in Spanish he has tried to tie the president to the Florida governor, who chaired a fund-raising committee for Mr. Trump during the 2016 election. Both candidates denounced a Trump administration program, since rescinded, that separated children who came into the country illegally from their parents. ""When that was happening, my opponent was silent,"" said Mr. Nelson. He said that, in 2010, Mr. Scott had favored adopting harsh statewide immigration policies, including proposed legislation requiring local law enforcement to help enforce immigration laws. (Mr. Scott had also favored an even stronger provision that would subject employers to fines if they failed to verify employees' immigration status; he has since adopted a softer immigration position.) On the family separation issue, Mr. Scott said, ""I completely disagree with the president, and my opponent should have gone back to D.C. and got something done."" On health care, Mr. Nelson focused on Mr. Scott's opposition to expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which the governor has favored repealing. Mr. Scott said he would keep insurance protections contained in the law for pre-existing medical conditions. On guns, Mr. Nelson painted Mr. Scott as a lackey of the National Rifle Association, while Mr. Scott noted he had signed limited gun restrictions into law after a former student killed 17 people earlier this year at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. At one point, Mr. Scott pressed Mr. Nelson on his claims that Russians hacked Florida's election systems, accusing him of baseless alarmism. No details have ever been provided. ""Either he made it up or tried to make people uncomfortable,"" Mr. Scott said. The senator offered no response. ""The governor continues to bring up issues to try to deflect from his record,"" Mr. Nelson said, in a deflection of his own."
News,2018-10-03,"BEIJING — China accused the country’s most famous actress, Fan Bingbing, of evading millions of dollars in taxes and warned others in the television and film industry to come clean or face a similar fate, according to a statement released to state media on Wednesday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/world/asia/fan-bingbing-tax-evasion-china.html,1019," BEIJING — China accused the country's most famous actress, Fan Bingbing, of evading millions of dollars in taxes and warned others in the television and film industry to come clean or face a similar fate, according to a statement released to state media on Wednesday. The authorities fined Ms. Fan, 37, the equivalent of nearly $70 million in unpaid taxes and penalties after an investigation found that she and employees of her production company had underreported her earnings from her blockbuster films — a practice that is said to be common in China, and not only in the entertainment industry. In her first public statement since dropping from public view four months ago, Ms. Fan offered a contrite apology and pledged to pay the fine to avoid a criminal investigation. The tax authorities in Beijing and Jiangsu, the province where her production company is based, said that since this was Ms. Fan's first offense, she would not face criminal charges as long as she and her company paid her fine and an additional $60 million in back taxes owed by her company. ""I have been through pain and suffering I have never had before,"" Ms. Fan wrote in a post on Weibo, the Twitter-like website, her first since June 2. ""I have had deep and profound self-reflection. I feel shamed and guilty for what I have done."" Others will face charges, though. In a statement released to the state news media, the authorities cited potentially criminal actions by the company's employees, including obstruction of the tax investigation. The statement said that one person — her agent, Mou Enguang, according to news reports — was taken into custody. Ms. Fan's prominence suggests that the authorities intended to send a broader signal with the investigation.

When it comes to the entertainment industry, which is heavily censored in China, the government is particularly sensitive to the influence its stars' behavior can have — for better or worse — on public opinion. Shortly after the inquiry began in June, the government announced that it would impose new limits on the salaries of actors, even in privately financed films. No one actor can now earn more than 70 percent of what the entire cast makes or more than 40 percent of production costs of a movie. The statement said the industry was ""distorting social values"" and ""fostering money worship tendencies"" with outsize compensation. The State Tax Administration warned in the statement that others in the entertainment industry could also face investigations unless they stepped forward to declare untaxed income. It set a deadline of Dec. 31, promising that those who complied voluntarily would not have to pay penalties. For Ms. Fan, the reputational damage has already been done. She was, until this summer, one of the most recognizable women in China, having appeared in dozens of movies and television series and achieved global recognition with roles in the ""X-Men"" and ""Iron Man"" franchises. During what had become an annual star-turn at the Cannes Film Festival in May, she joined Jessica Chastain, Lupita Nyong'o, Marion Cotillard and Penélope Cruz in promoting their roles as superspies in a planned thriller, ""355."" The fate of that role, as well as numerous branding contracts that were abruptly canceled or suspended since then, remains to be seen. Her current whereabouts is not known, though there have been unsubstantiated reports that she has been detained during the course of the investigation. Ms. Fan's abrupt fall from public grace has been one of the biggest news sensations in China in recent months, worrying fans and colleagues while delighting others who relished the travails of a rich celebrity. In commentary that censors appeared to be trying to suppress, people reacted online on Wednesday with both gleeful disdain and also incredulity that so large an instance of tax evasion merited only a fine. ""Ordinary people who earn a little salary still need to pay taxes honestly,"" one user on Weibo wrote. Ms. Fan's legal troubles mushroomed after a personal grudge not directly related to her drew public attention. A retired state television anchor, Cui Yongyuan, posted accusations on Weibo in May that included photographs of two contracts for a coming film, a sequel to one of Ms. Fan's early successes, ""Cell Phone,"" released in 2003. One photo purported to show a salary of $1.6 million being reported to the tax authorities, the second an actual payment of $7.8 million. The practice of having dual contracts — known as ""yin and yang"" contracts — is widespread in many industries. Mr. Cui's anger appeared to be directed as much toward the director of ""Cell Phone,"" Feng Xiaogang, as toward Ms. Fan. Mr. Cui previously had accused him of slander because the plot — in which a prominent television anchor has an affair with an assistant, played by Ms. Fan — bore striking, though he said inaccurate, parallels to Mr. Cui's own career. In the statement, the authorities noted that Ms. Fan had used such dual contracts on at least four occasions. It detailed one involving a Chinese production, starring Bruce Willis and known in English as ""Unbreakable Spirit,"" about the Japanese bombing of China's wartime capital, Chongqing, from 1938 to 1943. In that case, the authorities said, Ms. Fan signed an actual contract for 20 million yuan, nearly $3 million, but declared only 10 million yuan in the contract submitted to the tax authorities. The film's release, originally scheduled for August, has also been delayed, and her role reportedly edited out. In addition to her apology, Ms. Fan offered an extraordinary statement of fealty to the state and the Communist Party which controls it for her career successes so far.

Interactive Feature,2018-10-03,"A map of the counties targeted by China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union in a trade war looks strikingly similar to a map of the 2016 presidential election.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/03/business/economy/china-tariff-retaliation.html,0," BEIJING — China accused the country's most famous actress, Fan Bingbing, of evading millions of dollars in taxes and warned others in the television and film industry to come clean or face a similar fate, according to a statement released to state media on Wednesday. The authorities fined Ms. Fan, 37, the equivalent of nearly $70 million in unpaid taxes and penalties after an investigation found that she and employees of her production company had underreported her earnings from her blockbuster films — a practice that is said to be common in China, and not only in the entertainment industry. In her first public statement since dropping from public view four months ago, Ms. Fan offered a contrite apology and pledged to pay the fine to avoid a criminal investigation. The tax authorities in Beijing and Jiangsu, the province where her production company is based, said that since this was Ms. Fan's first offense, she would not face criminal charges as long as she and her company paid her fine and an additional $60 million in back taxes owed by her company. ""I have been through pain and suffering I have never had before,"" Ms. Fan wrote in a post on Weibo, the Twitter-like website, her first since June 2. ""I have had deep and profound self-reflection.

News,2018-10-03,Good Wednesday. Want this by email? Sign up here.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/business/dealbook/trump-father-riches.html,1606," Good Wednesday. Want this by email? Sign up here. The president claims that his company was built solely through hard work. A 14,000-word investigation by the NYT begs to differ. It found that the Trump Organization owes its success to multimillion-dollar gifts from Fred C. Trump, President Trump's father, and tax schemes that some experts say may have broken the law. Highlights from the investigation: • His father's housing empire started paying Mr. Trump during childhood — the equivalent of $200,000 a year in today's money when he was three. • Mr. Trump has often said that his father lent him only $1 million. He received at least $60.7 million in loans, many never repaid. • Fred Trump grossly undervalued properties that he passed onto his children, dodging hundreds of millions in gift taxes. • The Trumps created a company that inflated the value of equipment purchased for their housing units and passed the difference onto the Trump children. One tax expert said that might have constituted criminal tax fraud. The statute of limitations has passed for potential criminal charges, but the Trump family could face civil fines. New York State's tax regulator said it has opened an investigation. A lawyer for Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the NYT. In raising its minimum wage for all U.S. employees to $15 an hour, Amazon was responding to criticism over its labor practices. But the move also helps it compete in a tight labor market — and potentially wounds its rivals. Amazon has taken fire from all political corners, including President Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren, over issues from worker conditions to anti-competitive practices. This policy, which affects 250,000 employees and 100,000 seasonal workers, buys it some political good will: Senator Bernie Sanders praised it as a ""shot heard round the world."" Amazon also knew it had to do something to keep delivery drivers and warehouse staff as unemployment has fallen. Target and Walmart already raised hourly wages, though not so far or so fast. Amazon's profit margins will undoubtedly take a hit. But the WSJ editorial board argues that, in lobbying for a higher federal minimum wage, the company is making life more expensive for rivals. Despite no shortage of scandal, Elon Musk's automaker looks to be successfully ramping up car production. It made 80,142 cars in the third quarter, it reported yesterday, 50 percent more than in the second. Its Model 3 output nearly doubled, into the 50,000-to-55,000 range that Mr. Musk had predicted. The carmaker delivered 83,500 vehicles to customers, 55,840 of which were Model 3s, about three times as many as in the second quarter. That's big: The mass-market Model 3 is crucial for Tesla's future. But as Neal Boudette of the NYT writes, the company still faces many challenges, not least on profitability: In previous quarters, the company's costs increased as it made more cars, wiping out any chance at getting into the black. Tesla is expected to report its third-quarter earnings later this month. David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, said that Tesla could report a profit for the quarter but that he was not convinced that it would. ""They're making more cars,"" he said, ""but it's hard to say if they are making money on every one."" Still, it's doing much better than the rest of the American auto market, which had a bad September, with worse to come. Bonus: Mr. Musk reportedly gave Tesla's board an ultimatum: Fight the S.E.C., or I quit. The F.B.I. is expected to finish a new check of Brett Kavanaugh as soon as today. Lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, said that the inquiry (which may be available only to senators) wasn't thorough enough. President Trump yesterday mocked Dr. Ford. Aston Martin begins trading on the London Stock Exchange. The British luxury automaker priced its I.P.O. at 19 pounds per share, but its stock fell by as much as 6.6 percent in early trading. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain will defend her Brexit plan. Her speech at the Conservative Party's conference will reportedly attempt to rally ministers — and the public — around her view of a post-E.U. future ""full of promise."" Facebook Connect, which lets users log into other apps with their Facebook accounts, was supposed to be a digital passport to the rest of the internet. Now it could be a big headache. The company on Friday said that account entry keys for at least 50 million Facebook users had been stolen. But Mike Isaac and Kate Conger of the NYT explain how Facebook Connect could exacerbate the problem: Those stolen credentials could have been used to gain access to so many other sites. Companies that allow customers to log in with Facebook Connect are scrambling to figure out whether their own user accounts have been compromised. The hack and its fallout underscore the lengths to which Facebook has cemented itself as the identity of the internet, and what happens when the security systems of one company — trusted by so many — fail. Facebook says there is currently ""no evidence"" that the hackers have gone into outside apps. But either way, you should probably stop using Facebook Connect. Bonus: The social network is taking new steps to stamp out bullying and harassment. The American economy is enjoying an unusual but sustainable period of low unemployment and low inflation, according to the Fed chairman — and it could continue. Economists usually have interpreted low unemployment as a warning of higher inflation. Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT explains why Mr. Powell is willing to believe that things are different right now: He said the Fed's success in holding down inflation in recent decades has reinforced public expectations that inflation would stay low, and that, in turn, is helping to keep inflation low. ""These developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation,"" Mr. Powell said on Tuesday in Boston at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics. Bonus: What central banks around the world will do next with interest rates. Coinbase, the world's biggest marketplace for trading cryptocurrencies, is close to finalizing a fund-raising round at an $8 billion valuation, Recode reports. Leading the round is Tiger Global Management, a respected venture capital firm that hasn't previously shown interest in the sector. It may mean that major investors believe in crypto, despite the industry's challenges. (Bitcoin is trading at about $6,478, 67 percent below its December 2017 peak, and other digital currencies are trading at lows as well.) Coinbase has suffered from that plunge, according to Recode. But its executives argue that the company remains a technology platform that can ride out the waxing and waning of crypto prices. Unless this all turns out to be a bubble. J.C. Penney hired Jill Soltau as its C.E.O. Volkswagen ousted Rupert Stadler as Audi's C.E.O. Snap hired David Byttow, a co-founder of the messaging app Secret, as its director of engineering.

Op-Ed,2018-10-03,This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/opinion/amazon-minimum-wage-bernie-sanders.html,947," This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. There are two ways to fight the long stagnation in living standards for most Americans. The first is probably the more obvious and the one I spend more time writing about: through government policy. The government can raise the minimum wage. It can increase the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is effectively a wage subsidy. It can cut taxes on the middle class. It can spend more money on education, child care and health care. All of these are good ideas. But they're not the only way to lift living standards. For much of the past century, another approach has been even more important: As the economy grew, American companies paid workers their fair share of the growth. Until the mid-1970s or so, this was the norm. The middle class and poor received larger raises than the affluent, in percentage terms, during the three decades after World War II (as you can see in this chart). Labor unions played a central role, using their power to win raises for unionized and non-unionized members alike. And political pressure and cultural norms also mattered. Corporate executives didn't feel comfortable maximizing their own pay and their company's profits at the expense of workers. How can the country return to a time when companies feel the need to pay a decent wage to their workers? Empowering labor unions would make a big difference, but unions aren't likely to return to their previous strength. So it's also important to look for other ways to put political pressure on corporate America. Which brings me to the story about Senator Bernie Sanders and Amazon. For months, Sanders has been criticizing the company for paying its workers too little. He went so far as to offer a bill called the ""Stop BEZOS Act,"" for Jeff Bezos, Amazon's C.E.O. The bill was deeply flawed, but it still served to call more attention to the issue. Eventually, the criticism of the company started spreading to the political right, as Jordan Weissmann of Slate points out. All of this attention wasn't pleasant for Amazon. It cares about its image. It's in the middle of a high-profile process to open a second headquarters in a major city. Many of its executives, no doubt, genuinely want both to earn a profit and to improve people's lives — just as the executives in the mid-20th century did. Yesterday, as you probably heard, Amazon announced that it was raising its minimum hourly pay to $15. About 350,000 workers will receive an immediate raise as a result. Amazon also called on other companies to do the same and said it would lobby Washington to increase the federal minimum wage. A tightening labor market no doubt contributed to Amazon's decision, but politics — avoiding ""the chance of regulations that pose a bigger cost down the road,"" as The Wall Street Journal's Dan Gallagher wrote — was the main factor. This is how democracy and capitalism are supposed to work. ""Jeff Bezos admitted a real degree of failure here and openly stated that the critics were right and he was wrong,"" wrote Shaun King, the writer and Black Lives Matter activist. ""Thank you @SenSanders,"" tweeted John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's former campaign chairman. Bezos thanked Sanders yesterday as well, in a Twitter exchange. For more on the importance of changing corporate behavior, I recommend a recent book by Peter Georgescu, the former C.E.O. of a major advertising agency, as well as coverage and analysis of Senator Elizabeth Warren's new legislation on this topic. Trump's tax fraud. If you're a subscriber to The Times and you're feeling angry this morning about President Trump's brazen tax cheating — as uncovered by a long Times investigation — I know how you feel. But I would also encourage you to make room to feel a small bit of pride, as well.  A long journalistic investigation, involving multiple reporters and editors, is expensive. The reason my colleagues in the newsroom are able to pursue such projects is because of the financial support of subscribers. All of us who work here are grateful for that support. Among the reactions to the investigation: ""If you're wondering how Trump managed to evade the tax authorities for so long, given the brazen acts reported in that NYT piece, note that we've basically stopped prosecuting white-collar crime and tax evasion,"" tweeted The Washington Post's Catherine Rampell. ""Most if not all of the transactions detailed in The Times can be pursued as civil tax fraud by both the federal and New York state governments,"" argues David Cay Johnston, a reporter who has covered Trump's finances for years. ""What we need now are serious investigations by Congress, by the IRS and by New York state and city tax authorities."" At a rally last night, Trump mocked Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused his Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault. As The Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein put it, Trump ""stoked his base w/a new culture war (over sexual assault & growing assertiveness by women) at least partly to distract from airtight evidence he abused the tax code to benefit the super rich (himself). In that way he encapsulated his presidency in a single night."" And as The Times's editorial board writes, Trump's lie-fueled rise has a lot in common with his presidency. ""Trump's willingness to bend the truth — and the rules — in the service of his myth looks less like innocent exaggeration than malicious deception, with a dollop of corruption tossed in for good measure.""

A year after her big speech was wrecked by a persistent cough and letters falling from the backdrop, Britain's prime minister, Theresa May, closed her Conservative Party's annual conference on Wednesday with an effective speech that combined self-deprecating humor and ironic dance moves with a call for unity. Emerging pretty much unscathed from a potentially treacherous meeting of a party bitterly divided over Britain's exit from the European Union, Mrs. May demanded its support ahead of a decisive few weeks in Brexit negotiations. She also promised an end to the program of austerity measures that contributed to the surprise loss of the Conservatives' parliamentary majority in an election last year. Mrs. May's leadership has been in question ever since that vote, but the public bloodletting at the conference in Birmingham proved less severe than some expected, allowing her to live to fight another day. ""She's like a really old Jeep, making its way slowly through a rutted field,"" said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College London. ""You keep thinking that it's going to break down, but it inches forward and just keeps on going."" For her conference speech, Mrs. May entered with some dance steps to the sound of Abba's ""Dancing Queen,"" a self-deprecating reference to  headlines she made with an awkward performance in Kenya in August. Then she joked about last year's conference speech disaster, telling the audience that if she coughed this year, it was only because she had been up all night fixing the letters to the backdrop. Then it was on to Britain's exit from the bloc, or Brexit. Mrs. May is scheduled to meet European leaders again this month, and told her party that she would be entering ""the toughest phase of the negotiations."" With a growing campaign for a second referendum on withdrawal, Mrs. May warned hard-line Euroskeptic critics, ""If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all."" The confident delivery notwithstanding, there was a contrast between the Conservative Party's scratchy meeting and the successful gathering last week of the opposition Labour Party, which outlined bold, left-wing economic plans designed to appeal to voters disenchanted after a decade of squeezed living standards. Both parties are split on Europe, but Labour is less so and, with the added luxury of being in opposition, has managed to fudge its differences. The opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, managed to quiet internal dissent despite a recent crisis over anti-Semitism in the party, and delivered a slick closing speech. On Wednesday, Mrs. May launched a fierce attack on Mr. Corbyn, questioning his patriotism, comparing him unfavorably to some of his predecessors and dismissing his proposals as ""bogus solutions that would make things worse."" She acknowledged, however, that some communities in Britain had been ""left behind"" and promised she was ""ending austerity,"" and that there were ""better days ahead."" Policy pledges included improved cancer treatment and new measures to increase home building. The Conservatives made several other announcements in Birmingham, but they were largely drowned out by the cacophony over Brexit, the culmination of decades of infighting in the party over European policy. The depth of the divisions over Europe was evident from the lengthy lines of activists snaking around the conference center, waiting to hear hard-line supporters of Brexit denounce Mrs. May's plan for withdrawal. They included Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, whose ferocious critique of Mrs. May's proposals deepened internal divisions but failed to ignite a full-blown leadership crisis. The bad news for Mrs. May is that the argument hasn't gone away. Her Chequers proposal, named after the country residence where it was crafted, would retain some close economic ties to the bloc in order to keep frictionless trade and protect the economy from serious damage. But hard-line Brexit supporters want a much cleaner break. They hate the idea of keeping some European economic rules over which Britain, as a nonmember country, would have no say, arguing this would render it a ""vassal state."" Worse, they know that, if Mrs. May is to reach a deal over Brexit, she will have to compromise further with the European Union. Mrs. May would then need to get any agreement through a Parliament in which she has no majority. At a meeting of the Euroskeptic Bruges Group on the fringes of the conference, there were loud boos at the mention of Oliver Robbins, a senior civil servant and architect of Mrs. May's Brexit proposals. References to other opponents of a clean break with the European Union were greeted with cries of ""traitors."" More ominous for Mrs. May was a promise from Owen Paterson, a former cabinet minister, to vote against her Chequers proposal because, he said, ""we won't have left — we will be in a much worse position."""

Mrs. May is scheduled to meet European leaders again this month, and told her party that she would be entering ""the toughest phase of the negotiations."" With a growing campaign for a second referendum on withdrawal, Mrs. May warned hard-line Euroskeptic critics, ""If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all."" The confident delivery notwithstanding, there was a contrast between the Conservative Party's scratchy meeting and the successful gathering last week of the opposition Labour Party, which outlined bold, left-wing economic plans designed to appeal to voters disenchanted after a decade of squeezed living standards. Both parties are split on Europe, but Labour is less so and, with the added luxury of being in opposition, has managed to fudge its differences. The opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, managed to quiet internal dissent despite a recent crisis over anti-Semitism in the party, and delivered a slick closing speech. On Wednesday, Mrs. May launched a fierce attack on Mr. Corbyn, questioning his patriotism, comparing him unfavorably to some of his predecessors and dismissing his proposals as ""bogus solutions that would make things worse."" She acknowledged, however, that some communities in Britain had been ""left behind"" and promised she was ""ending austerity,"" and that there were ""better days ahead."" Policy pledges included improved cancer treatment and new measures to increase home building. The Conservatives made several other announcements in Birmingham, but they were largely drowned out by the cacophony over Brexit, the culmination of decades of infighting in the party over European policy. The depth of the divisions over Europe was evident from the lengthy lines of activists snaking around the conference center, waiting to hear hard-line supporters of Brexit denounce Mrs. May's plan for withdrawal. They included Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, whose ferocious critique of Mrs. May's proposals deepened internal divisions but failed to ignite a full-blown leadership crisis. The bad news for Mrs. May is that the argument hasn't gone away. Her Chequers proposal, named after the country residence where it was crafted, would retain some close economic ties to the bloc in order to keep frictionless trade and protect the economy from serious damage. But hard-line Brexit supporters want a much cleaner break. They hate the idea of keeping some European economic rules over which Britain, as a nonmember country, would have no say, arguing this would render it a ""vassal state."" Worse, they know that, if Mrs. May is to reach a deal over Brexit, she will have to compromise further with the European Union. Mrs. May would then need to get any agreement through a Parliament in which she has no majority. At a meeting of the Euroskeptic Bruges Group on the fringes of the conference, there were loud boos at the mention of Oliver Robbins, a senior civil servant and architect of Mrs. May's Brexit proposals. References to other opponents of a clean break with the European Union were greeted with cries of ""traitors."" More ominous for Mrs. May was a promise from Owen Paterson, a former cabinet minister, to vote against her Chequers proposal because, he said, ""we won't have left — we will be in a much worse position."""

The new deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, staves off a trade war, reassuring some Canadian readers who said they were pleased with it.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/reader-center/canadian-reactions-nafta-changes-usmca.html,975," The United States, Mexico and Canada finalized a new trade agreement Sunday to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. The new deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, staves off a trade war, reassuring some Canadian readers who said they were pleased with it. But many Canadians took to our comment section to tell us that, more than anything, they are angry over how the deal was achieved. They called the Trump administration's negotiating tactics ""bullying"" techniques and ""name-calling"" rather than diplomacy. A selection of comments from Canadian readers is below. They have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.  If you hold a gun to the head of your much smaller and weaker neighbor to force him to give you a few more apples off his tree, and he complies, I guess you could call that ""success."" But no one would call it a reasonable negotiation between friendly neighbors. Let's be very clear about that. — Nick Wright, Halifax, Nova Scotia This is a bad agreement for Canada. We gave up far too much while the Americans gave up nothing of consequence. We failed to capitalize on Donald Trump's vulnerability and succumbed to his bullying. We too suffer from bad leadership. Trudeau has made a habit of posturing on issues that are important to Canadians. Then he does exactly the opposite. — Randall, Canada The U.S. won't find a fairer trading partner than Canada. The numbers verify this. Canada won't forget the bully tactics and incivility of Trump, et al., in these (supposed) negotiations. Thanks, ""friend."" — JC, Toronto [Alan Rappeport, a Times reporter, answered questions about the new trade deal among the United States, Mexico and Canada.] I'm a Canadian and a U.S. permanent resident working in the U.S. I feel like the trade deal is a win-win situation, although the U.S. benefits more, and Trump got a big win. Sure, Canada would have preferred the status quo with Nafta, and it would have gotten that with any other U.S. president (Republican or Democrat). But by signing this deal, Canada has avoided a recession, which Trump could certainly have caused with a stroke of his pen.  For Trump, he secured some important things. None earth-shattering, but he basically got something for nothing, so it's no doubt a win. — Ray Fox, New York My view from Canada is that our negotiators managed to at least stave off the more contentious Trump demands: Getting rid of the Chapter 19 dispute-resolution mechanism, which would have made it very unfair for us; and keeping the cultural exemptions clause (which prevents American media companies from taking over the Canadian media landscape entirely). So I am glad that our negotiators stuck to their guns on those two things. Also, I think the rules regarding the autoworkers will be good for both the Canadian and American autoworkers. There were some concessions from Canada on dairy products, but we are talking about a less than 4 percent concession, and I think Canadian consumers might find a way to buy Canadian whenever possible. In the end, given that a ""no deal"" situation would have been devastating for a lot of businesses on both sides of our border, I think it made sense to sign the deal. — Wendy, Canada Not a lot has changed except for the name. The dispute resolution mechanism still remains intact and the United States is not getting any additional access to Canadian dairy than they would have received under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The U.S. could have had this 18 months ago. Sorry, American friends, but Trump only replaced Nafta with Nafta and caused strained relations with his neighbors.  — TK, Canada As a Canadian whose career has been tied to the automotive industry for years, the future of Nafta has always been top of mind. After all the bluster, what has Trump achieved?  Virtually nothing that wasn't already agreed in the aborted T.P.P. agreement negotiated by the previous administration. The access to the dairy market was already done. Trump may think that a new name makes it a new deal, but this excuse for an administration has wasted two years to disrupt everything, and achieve nothing.  — View From Europe, Paris The agreement is largely a refresh of a 25-year-old pact that has brought together the economies of Canada, Mexico and the United States but had become somewhat outdated in the digital age. Trump can call it a triumph if he wants, but for all his huffing and puffing and threatening to blow the house down, the essentials of Nafta, a.k.a. to his base as ""the worst deal for America ever,"" remain intact.  — Leigh, Quebec Do not consider the friendship resurrected. The feeling up here is that Canadians will not soon forget the treatment from our supposed ally. We are a small nation that will never have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, however there is a collective ""sour taste"" left in the mouths of many Canadians. — Kevin, Canada People here will buy what they like, but there is this sensibility now that we shouldn't unquestioningly support the U.S. like we used to do. The U.S.A. has gone from friend to just neighbor in the minds of many Canadians. It will take a generation or so for that to wear off. — Rese, Canada Concluding a trade agreement is usually an occasion to affirm and celebrate friendship between nations. This one feels more like a nonaggression pact. More like stable wariness than genuine friendship. — Peeking Through the Fence, Vancouver Marie Tae McDermott contributed reporting.

News,2018-10-03,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the United States was pulling out of a six-decade-old treaty with Iran that had provided a basis for normalizing relations between the two countries, including diplomatic and economic exchanges.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/world/middleeast/us-withdraws-treaty-iran.html,1191," WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the United States was pulling out of a six-decade-old treaty with Iran that had provided a basis for normalizing relations between the two countries, including diplomatic and economic exchanges. The largely symbolic move came hours after the International Court of Justice ordered the United States to ensure that a new round of American sanctions imposed against Tehran this year did not prevent food, medicine and aircraft parts from reaching Iran. The treaty bears little relevance to the current relationship between Washington and Tehran. The move is the latest in a broad effort by the Trump administration to isolate Iran, reversing a diplomatic drive embraced by former President Barack Obama. The ruling by the international court in The Hague was related to a complaint that Iran filed in July, arguing that the new sanctions violated the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and Consular Rights, which was signed in 1955. In essence, the ruling sought to protect Iran's public and economy from what the court described as irreparable damage while justices continue to consider the case against the sanctions. But in his announcement, Mr. Pompeo made clear that the United States would ignore the ruling — simply by scrapping the bilateral treaty with Iran. ""The Iranians have been ignoring it for an awfully long time,"" Mr. Pompeo told reporters at the State Department. He said the legal complaint amounted to an attempt by Iran to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United States. He also said that the court's decision was outside its jurisdiction and that Iran's appeals ""lacked merit."" Still, he said, the United States would continue to try to deliver humanitarian aid to the Iranian people, and existing exceptions to the economic sanctions would remain in effect. President Trump imposed the sanctions after withdrawing in May from a 2015 agreement between Iran and world powers that sought to keep Tehran from restarting its nuclear program. All the other parties to the accord — Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia and the European Union — say Iran is complying with its terms. After Mr. Pompeo's announcement, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran said on Twitter that the United States was an ""outlaw regime."" He praised the court's ruling earlier, saying it marked ""another failure"" for the ""sanctions-addicted"" United States and ""victory for rule of law."" In legal terms, the United States withdrawal from the 1955 treaty with Iran does not take effect immediately. The treaty remains in place for one year from any announcement of withdrawal, meaning Iran's lawsuit will proceed. It was negotiated after the C.I.A. helped stage a coup in Iran that Iranians still cite as a gross violation of the country's sovereignty. The 1953 coup, code-named Operation Ajax, was engineered by Kermit Roosevelt Jr., a grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt, and installed a government that two years later cemented the treaty with President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The treaty sets up commercial relationships, tax structures and access to each nation's courts. None of that has applied since the 1979 Islamic revolution. ""The treaty with Iran is a weird treaty,"" said Julian Ku, a professor of constitutional and international law at Hofstra University Law School. ""We haven't been friends with Iran in a long time."" Mr. Ku said there have been two other instances since the 1980s in which the United States withdrew from a treaty after an unfavorable ruling by the International Court of Justice. One was during the Reagan administration, in a case brought in 1984 by Nicaragua; the second was in 2005, when the George W. Bush administration lost a case brought by Mexico. Lawyers for the United States had argued that the sanctions dispute with Iran was a matter of American national security, and therefore the court had no jurisdiction to intervene. Rulings by the International Court of Justice are legally binding but difficult to enforce; in the past, both the United States and Iran have ignored its orders. Wednesday's unanimous order by the court's 15 judges — including one American — stopped far short of outright siding with Iran, which had asked for an immediate halt to all sanctions. At the White House, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, separately announced that the United States would review all treaties that require it to participate in cases before the international court. Additionally, he said the Trump administration would no longer abide by an optional provision to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations that requires certain disputes to be settled by the court. The United States remains in the Vienna Convention itself, but Mr. Bolton was aiming to undermine a lawsuit filed last week by Palestinian officials over the move of the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. ""The United States will not sit idly by as baseless, politicized claims are brought against us,"" Mr. Bolton said. Robert Malley, the president of the International Crisis Group and a former White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf during the Obama administration, said Mr. Bolton's statement underscored ""why the Trump administration is increasingly isolated on the world stage."" ""This bellicosity undermines U.S. interests and, by escalating tensions and forfeiting diplomacy, risks putting us on a path toward conflict in the Middle East,"" Mr. Malley said. Last week, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said he would consider re-entering negotiations with the United States — if Mr. Trump first recommitted to the nuclear deal that was struck in 2015. But in withdrawing from the 1955 treaty on Wednesday, Mr. Pompeo also appeared to reject the idea of returning to normalized relations with Iran. That was the overall, long-term objective of the 2015 nuclear accord, in addition to having Iran agree to moving 97 percent of its nuclear material outside its borders. Mr. Pompeo underscored a larger strategy by the United States to confront Iran across the Middle East, emphasizing what he said were hostile Iranian actions. In early November, the United States is expected to impose a broad series of additional sanctions against Tehran that will threaten to cut off companies around the world that also do business with Iran. Administration officials are looking to force Iran to withdraw its troops and militias it supports in Syria. In Yemen, despite large numbers of civilian casualties and growing outrage among American legislators, the United States has continued to support a war being waged by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against the Iranian-backed Houthis. And in Iraq, the United States is evacuating all diplomats, security guards and other employees from its consulate in the southern city of Basra after several recent rocket attacks by what Mr. Pompeo said were Iranian-backed militias. No one was injured in the strikes, which landed on the perimeter of the airfield near the consulate building. Senior State Department officials had debated for more than a year whether to shut down the consulate to save money. Mr. Pompeo cited ""solid"" intelligence indicating that Iran was behind the attacks. ""We can see the hand of the ayatollah and his henchmen,"" Mr. Pompeo said on Wednesday, referring to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei."
News,2018-10-03,"LIMA, Peru — Alberto Fujimori, the former Peruvian dictator imprisoned for human rights abuses but then pardoned last year, was ordered back to prison on Wednesday, reigniting debate over the fate of one of the region’s most contentious figures.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/world/peru-alberto-fujimori.html,866," LIMA, Peru — Alberto Fujimori, the former Peruvian dictator imprisoned for human rights abuses but then pardoned last year, was ordered back to prison on Wednesday, reigniting debate over the fate of one of the region's most contentious figures. Human rights advocates hailed the ruling, but Mr. Fujimori's defiant supporters and his politically powerful daughter, Keiko, gathered outside his house on Wednesday to condemn it. ""This is persecution against my family,"" Ms. Fujimori said. It was the latest dramatic turn for Mr. Fujimori, 80, who ruled as a dictator in the 1990s after suspending the Constitution, only to land in a prison cell when he tried to stage a political comeback in the early 2000s. He was freed last December, but his fate was reversed again on Wednesday, with the Supreme Court issuing orders for his arrest ""so he would be returned to penitentiary,"" according to a statement released on Twitter. Miguel Pérez Arroyo, a lawyer for Mr. Fujimori, told Peruvian television that Mr. Fujimori was ""dismayed"" by the decision but would comply while filing an appeal. By early evening, Mr. Fujimori had been taken to a hospital in Lima, the capital, where authorities had arrived with orders to arrest him. The ruling was the latest episode in a drama that has captivated the nation since Mr. Fujimori's pardon late last year, which brought back memories of his dictatorship and played a part in the toppling of a president this year. Mr. Fujimori had been sentenced in 2009 to a 25-year term for rights abuses that included the killing of more than two dozen people by a military death squad that prosecutors said Mr. Fujimori had created. Last December, President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned Mr. Fujimori on medical grounds. The announcement took Peru by surprise as Mr. Kuczynski was not an ally of the ex-president. But he was facing an impeachment threat led by the former president's daughter, Ms. Fujimori, who held a seat in Congress, leading many to see the pardon as part of a deal for the president's survival. But the move backfired as victims' groups organized protests, and the United Nations condemned the release. By March, Ms. Fujimori led another push to oust Mr. Kuczynski amid a corruption scandal, and the president resigned. The former dictator, meanwhile, had remained a free man. Francisco Soberón, the director of the Association for Human Rights, a Peruvian group, applauded the court's decision to put Mr. Fujimori back in jail. ""It's a great achievement for the families after 26 years of struggling for justice that was cut short by that terrible pardon,"" he said. ""It is an encouragement for justice in Peru,"" he said, describing the system as in a state of crisis because of widespread corruption. Victims groups had previously sought a reversal of the pardon, bringing a case before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights this year. The court, in turn, sent the case back to Peru's government, asking it to examine whether the pardon was legal. Aníbal Quiroga, a law professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, said that even though the president can pardon criminals, the Supreme Court had a strong case for overruling Mr. Fujimori's pardon. Peru may have run afoul of international treaties by freeing someone of Mr. Fujimori's stature who was convicted of human rights violations, he said. While Peru has been known for a growing economy and popular tourist sites, Mr. Fujimori's release was a reminder of a more bitter era that many in the country would rather forget. The son of Japanese immigrants, Mr. Fujimori was elected in 1990 as a political outsider at a time when the Shining Path and the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, left-wing rebel groups, challenged the military and engaged in terror campaigns that left around 70,000 people dead. Hyperinflation was racking Peru's economy. Claiming that Congress was incapable of taking on either threat, Mr. Fujimori suspended the Constitution and ruled as an autocrat. While he eventually restored laws and was re-elected in 1995, his government came increasingly under suspicion for corruption, attacks on political opponents and massacres of civilians. After resigning in 2000, he fled to Japan. His 2009 trial exposed some of the darkest days of the dictatorship. The court found that Mr. Fujimori had created a death squad in the 1990s that had murdered 15 people at a neighborhood gathering in Lima and another 10 who were kidnapped and whose bodies were later burned. Among the dead was an 8-year-old boy. Despite the conviction, Mr. Fujimori and his political family remain popular among many Peruvians for having defeated the Shining Path. His daughter, Ms. Fujimori, wields vast power in the Congress, where her party has the largest number of seats. Martín Vizcarra, the president who took over after Mr. Kuczynski's resignation, has yet to establish himself as a powerful force. Fernando Tuesta, a political scientist in Lima, said that Ms. Fujimori's political star continues to rise and that she will likely use her aging father's imprisonment as a rallying cry. ""I think that she is going to take this to the streets in the next few days to boost her candidates"" in coming elections, Mr. Tuesta said. ""They will take advantage of this."""
Op-Ed,2018-10-04,"BERLIN — On. Oct. 3, Germans celebrated Reunification Day, the moment when, 28 years ago, the former East and West Germany became one nation again. And yet this year, instead of celebrating our unity, there is a growing sense of estrangement. East and west are drifting apart again.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/opinion/why-is-eastern-germany-so-far-right.html,1008," BERLIN — On. Oct. 3, Germans celebrated Reunification Day, the moment when, 28 years ago, the former East and West Germany became one nation again. And yet this year, instead of celebrating our unity, there is a growing sense of estrangement. East and west are drifting apart again. A few weeks ago, a young man was stabbed to death at a city festival in Chemnitz, a city in eastern Germany; afterward two asylum seekers were arrested in connection with the attack. Large demonstrations broke out around the city, dominated at times by hundreds of right-wing extremists. Some raised their hands in the Hitler salute; journalists and counterdemonstrators were verbally and physically attacked; a mob threw stones at the owner of a Jewish restaurant.  Similar demonstrations broke out in Köthen, a town of 30,000 inhabitants in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt. And on Monday, the police arrested seven men accused of planning attacks on politicians and foreigners on Wednesday. These events are not random. While violent crimes committed by right-wing extremists are down from 2016, they are still far more frequent in the five eastern German states than in the west, according to the annual report of Germany's interior secret service. And then, there are the polls. The eastern states of Brandenburg and Saxony will both hold elections next September. For both states, pollsters predict record results for the far-right populist Alternative for Germany party.  East Germany was, of course, a Communist country; today it is a hotbed of far-right sympathy and outright hatred. What happened? The question angers Wolfgang Thierse, a Social Democrat and former president of the German Parliament, who was raised in the East. In the 1970s, he worked briefly for the Ministry of Culture in the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, but he was let go after refusing to support the expulsion of Wolf Biermann, a popular singer and critic of the Communist government. There is no such thing as ""the East,"" Mr. Thierse told me. Eastern Germany, he says, is not one place, but a mix — areas of prosperity, creativity and economic innovation next door to areas of economic squalor and despair. Mr. Thierse's assessment is reflected in the government's annual ""Report on the State of the German Union,"" which was presented last week. While pensions and wages are rising and unemployment is down, the average income in the former East lags the former West by around 15 percent. The eastern economy sports some champion businesses, but has altogether fewer large companies, and lesser international investment. The eastern states have an older demographic, and a harder time finding qualified workers. The economic differences are just one piece in the puzzle of why the East seems so far to the right. Other explanations focus on the legacy of the political culture of the German Democratic Republic. Many across Germany felt like Chancellor Angela Merkel imposed her decision to accept a large number of refugees on the country — but eastern Germans, having lived under an authoritarian regime, reacted more strongly to decisions they feel they did not have a say in.  Second, there are fewer migrants living in the east; people there lack the opportunity for everyday interactions with them, and thus harbor irrational fears of outsiders. Some also claim that eastern Germans, not having learned what democracy is like, are more easily frustrated with its tedious processes and often less-than-perfect results. Johannes Staemmler stresses a different point. Mr. Staemmler, born in the eastern city of Dresden in 1982, co-founded Third Generation East, a network of young professionals of eastern German descent. Today, he's a scientist and counselor working for a think tank in Potsdam, outside Berlin. He points out that many who joined the far-right protests in Chemnitz or vote for the Alternative for Germany are too young to have more than the faintest memories of the G.D.R. But they do remember the radical changes of the 1990s: privatization, the rapid death of East German industries and ensuing job losses. Mr. Thierse and Mr. Staemmler, both born in the East, are heard and respected by Germans on both sides of the geographic divide. Overall, however, the debate about what's happening in the east is dominated by western voices. Even 28 years after Germany's reunification, most prominent journalists are westerners, as are most prominent policymakers and business leaders. So when Germany discusses why the east is so far right, condescension almost inevitably sneaks in: For the sake of the argument, eastern Germany is unbuckled from the rest of the country, and the historical border is redrawn. In this new, old divide, eastern Germans are reduced to being subjects of analysis and policy proposals — never participants in the conversation.  The east and west are still like unequal siblings. The strong one loves his smaller and uglier brother and accepts that his deviant behavior comes from trauma, but he still looks down on him. This subjugation of eastern Germans to mostly western German psychoanalysis is a political drama in itself. It seems like even in their most violent, most determined actions, eastern Germans can never be agents. ""Yes, eastern Germans are on the couch,"" said Mr. Staemmler when I offered this interpretation. To him, however, the current public analysis is not necessarily disenfranchising. He says it could also become a moment of political empowerment. Suddenly people who haven't voted in decades are going to the ballot box. They may not vote for the party the rest of the country would like them to vote for. But at least they are politicized, and have the nation's attention. ""You could also look at it this way: Whoever is on the couch has the chance to talk."" Whichever way, it really is the moment to talk. It may mean talking to someone who is yelling at you, as Mr. Staemmler puts it. But it still is better to try it anyway, instead of letting eastern Germans sink back into scornful silence.

briefing,2018-10-04,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/briefing/indonesia-brett-kavanaugh-iran.html,1274," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Blame in Indonesia, a late-night announcement in Washington, an arrest in France. Here's the latest: • What went wrong in Indonesia? As the death toll continues to rise on Sulawesi Island — to 1,407 on Wednesday — officials are trying to understand why an early warning system for earthquakes and tsunamis failed to protect the island. The system was set up in 2008, with seismographic sensors, buoys and tidal gauges. But a combination of vandalism, maintenance shortfalls and infrastructure damaged by the earthquake meant residents didn't receive enough warning to evacuate. _____ • The F.B.I. completes its Kavanaugh report. Early Thursday, the White House sent the Senate the completed F.B.I. investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, saying it was ""confident"" that he would be confirmed to the court. The White House issued its statement around 2:30 a.m., just hours after Senate Republicans moved to schedule a vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Republicans are also stepping up efforts to challenge the veracity of Christine Blasey Ford, Judge Kavanaugh's main accuser, confronting her with a sworn statement from a former boyfriend who questioned some of her testimony last week. But those attacks, along with President Trump's mockery of Dr. Blasey at a campaign rally, could complicate the party's efforts to confirm Judge Kavanaugh by alienating three key Republican senators, Jeff Flake, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. All three condemned the president's remarks about Dr. Blasey. In the meantime, more than 1,000 law professors signed a letter to the Senate saying that Judge Kavanaugh did not have the ""judicial temperament"" for the court. It was published by Times Opinion. _____ • A U.N. court rebukes the U.S. over its Iran sanctions. The International Court of Justice, the U.N.'s highest court, ordered the U.S. to ease sanctions against Iran. Rulings by the court are legally binding, but it has no way of enforcing them. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wasted no time responding, announcing in a largely symbolic move that the U.S. was canceling a 1955 treaty that was the basis for friendly diplomatic exchanges and economic relations with Iran, long before its Islamic revolution turned the two nations into enemies. Above, the Grand Bazaar in Tehran. _____ • A French ""escape king"" is captured.  The escape scene unfolded like a top-notch thriller. Armed men hijacked a helicopter and swept into a French prison yard in July, scooping up Rédoine Faïd, a notorious inmate serving a 25-year sentence for a robbery that left a police officer dead. But now, after an intensive manhunt, Mr. Faïd is back in custody. Above, the apartment building outside Paris where he was arrested. Although no one disputed he had done bad things — this was Mr. Faïd's second prison break — he has gained a somewhat mythical status. Even detectives admit that he is far from an ordinary criminal. • The actress Priyanka Chopra, above center, is also a tech investor, one of the few female celebrities wading into Silicon Valley. Her focus is on companies trying to make a social impact and founded by women. • Entrepreneurs in China worry that the country may be stepping back from the free-market policies that transformed it into the world's No. 2 economy, our Asia technology columnist writes. • Fitness devices have found their way into the tech toolbox used by law enforcement experts to solve crimes. Here's a representative case, from California. •  Here's a snapshot of global markets. The Shanghai stock exchange is closed. • China's actions against Fan Bingbing, above, the country's most famous actress, suggest officials are stepping up enforcement of laws against tax evasion.

(Dr. Arnold was the fifth woman to receive the chemistry prize.) No Nobels are expected today, but the Peace Prize comes Friday. [The New York Times] • What a difference a year makes. Britain's prime minister, Theresa May, closed her Conservative Party's annual conference with an effective speech that used humor and a dance routine to call for unity over the country's exit from the E.U. Last year, her conference speech was wrecked by a persistent cough and letters falling from the backdrop.

Op-Ed,2018-10-04,"PARIS — On June 11, 1957, at 11 p.m., French soldiers burst into Maurice Audin’s apartment in Algiers. Mr. Audin, a 25-year-old mathematician, just had time to tell his wife, Josette, “Take care of the children” before being marched down the staircase by two paratroopers.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/opinion/france-torture-algeria-war.html,1153," PARIS — On June 11, 1957, at 11 p.m., French soldiers burst into Maurice Audin's apartment in Algiers. Mr. Audin, a 25-year-old mathematician, just had time to tell his wife, Josette, ""Take care of the children"" before being marched down the staircase by two paratroopers. Those were the last words she heard from him. Neither she nor their three children, then 3 years old, 18 months and 1 month, ever saw him again. For the next 61 years, Ms. Audin, helped by French intellectuals, fought to have the facts established about her husband, who was a member of the Algerian Communist Party and an antiwar activist. The French Army said he had escaped while being transferred. The truth was more sinister: In a 1958 book based on witness accounts, the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet revealed that Mr. Audin was tortured by the military and died either as a result of his treatment or by summary execution. Thousands of Algerians similarly went missing during their war for independence from 1954 to 1962, and for six decades France had nothing to say about those disappearances. Finally, on Sept. 13, President Emmanuel Macron paid a visit to Josette Audin, now 87, at her home in Bagnolet, a Paris suburb, to seek forgiveness and tell her and her children, ""in the name of the French Republic,"" what they knew all along: that the official version was a lie and that Mr. Vidal-Naquet had been right — although the precise cause of Mr. Audin's death is still unknown. More remarkably, in a statement released the same day, Mr. Macron admitted what no French president before him had dared to acknowledge: that torture by French forces was widespread during the Algerian war as a product, in Mr. Macron's words, of a ""legally established system."" French historians described this admission, which goes far beyond the emblematic Audin case, as a turning point for French history. President Macron also promised that archives that might shed light on the disappeared would be opened. Could official France finally be coming to terms with its colonial past? It certainly helps that Mr. Macron is the first French president born after the Algerian war. In every African country he visits he makes this point: As a 40-year-old, he does not feel burdened by this part of French history, and he encourages young Africans to look ahead, not back.  It also took France more than half a century to acknowledge its complicity in deporting Jews during World War II; President Jacques Chirac did that in a 1995 speech at the site where Jews rounded up by the French police were detained before being sent to Nazi death camps. Previous presidents had supported the fiction that the Vichy regime, not France, bore responsibility for what Mr. Chirac called ""the irreparable."" Mr. Chirac, who was too young to have participated in World War II, had a clean conscience about the German occupation. But he did serve in Algeria as a junior officer, and as president avoided the Algerian war as an issue. Algeria has a special and painful place in French national memory, and vice versa. The Algerian war in the French psyche is often likened to the Vietnam War for Americans — two conscription wars that ended in humiliating defeat. But the Algerian wounds, kept under a lid, are deeper. More than a colony, Algeria had been made an integral part of France. For more than a century, hundreds of thousands of settlers left France for a new life across the Mediterranean. After the war, their descendants returned to a country many had never known, and they never quite accepted their loss. More than 1.5 million French conscripts fought in the war; 23,000 died, and those who came back traumatized kept silent. France's booming economy made the 1960s a time for optimism, not tales of failure. Amnesty laws ensured that army officers would not be held accountable for war crimes. Still, the two countries seem forever intertwined. Algiers and its spectacular bay still seem a mirror image of Marseille, on the other side of the sea. Algerian immigrants flocked to France for jobs in the 1960s and '70s, when labor was needed. Today, their children and grandchildren are French, but they have inherited a troubled legacy.  The resentment never vanished. ""As long as our common history is locked, we'll keep going in circles, as we've done since 1962,"" a senior French diplomat told me two months ago. ""France must make some kind of gesture."" Will President Macron's move unlock this tragic past? Algeria's minister of veteran affairs, Tayeb Zitouni, welcomed it as ""a positive, commendable step."" But only a step. Mr. Macron's words about torture were cautious, and the Élysée, France's presidential palace, noted that he was extending ""recognition,"" not ""repentance."" A week later, the French president awarded the Légion d'Honneur to a group of Harkis, the 150,000 Algerians who chose to side with the French during the war and paid a heavy price for it. This is his point: the injustice to be repaired is on both sides.  Florence Beaugé, a journalist who investigated the use of torture in the Algerian war, wishes that Mr. Macron had included in his statement, along with Mr. Audin, two other Algerians who suffered the same fate: Ali Boumendjel, a lawyer, and Larbi Ben M'Hidi, a leader of the insurrection. ""This would have been a huge step forward,"" Ms. Beaugé said.  Ms. Beaugé opened the floodgates of memory in 2000 with an interview of Louisette Ighilahriz, an activist for Algerian independence who recounted being raped and tortured by French soldiers in 1957 while generals looked on. She spoke out after all those years to thank the army doctor who found her after an interrogation session and saved her life. The publication of the interview, on Le Monde's front page, was such a shock that shortly afterward, two retired generals agreed to speak out. They admitted overseeing the use of torture, giving new impetus to a debate that refused to go away. ""It was not so much remorse as a need to talk,"" Ms. Beaugé says. ""They had to unload their dark past before leaving this world.""  Many of these actors are now gone, as is former President François Mitterrand, who in 1957 was justice minister in the Socialist government that gave the French Army a green light to crush the insurrection at all costs.  As the official truth finally moves ahead, soul-searching can be expected about the political responsibilities of both Socialists and Gaullists, and of the highest echelons of the French armed forces. Light will have to be shed on the extent to which rape was used as a weapon, along with torture. The present Algerian leadership, heir to the independence war, will also have to finally confront the dark side of the insurgency's struggle. The introspection won't be easy, but it is now, at last, inevitable. Sylvie Kauffmann is the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, and a contributing opinion writer."
News,2018-10-04,"In the 2016 election, Donald J. Trump tapped into a sentiment strongly held by white working-class voters that America had changed so much around them that they felt estranged in their own country.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/upshot/estranged-america-trump-polarization.html,1146," In the 2016 election, Donald J. Trump tapped into a sentiment strongly held by white working-class voters that America had changed so much around them that they felt estranged in their own country. The sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild described that feeling among conservative voters in Louisiana in her 2016 book, ""Strangers in Their Own Land."" In pre-election polling, that belief strongly predicted support for Mr. Trump among working-class whites. And in postelection analyses of those voters, the same sense of estrangement kept coming up. But for all its associations with Trump voters, the mood appears to have spread over the last two years. In a series of competitive congressional districts where The New York Times has been polling the midterm electorate, nearly half of Democrats say they feel this way — slightly more than among Republicans.  Forty-seven percent of voters who approve of Mr. Trump say they feel like strangers in their own country, while 44 percent of those who disapprove of him say the same. Nearly half of women feel this way. About 60 percent of African-Americans and Asian-Americans do. A majority of voters say this in West Virginia coal country and in a deeply conservative Kentucky district. But the feeling is also common in the highly educated suburbs of Orange County, Calif.  The seven districts that we've polled on that question — talking to 3,555 likely voters in California, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota and West Virginia — are not representative of the entire country. But they contain communities that are pulling ahead in America and those that are falling behind, as well as places that mirror the nation's demographic future and its past.  The findings echo other polling on the question since Mr. Trump's election. And together, the results suggest a rare political moment when Americans on all sides worry that they don't recognize what the country is becoming. ""Normally, even in a politically polarized society, one side wins and they're content,"" said Stephanie McCurry, a historian at Columbia University. ""It's the other side that feels shut out of power."" The moment now reminds her of the 1850s, when Northerners and Southerners were locked in a morally imbued fight over the nature of American values — and whether America was at its core a slave-owning society. Many Northerners were horrified by the 1857 Dred Scott decision, which effectively declared the United States such a place. Southerners were horrified by Northerners' reaction to it, Ms. McCurry said. ""At that point, what you're looking at is this sense of powerlessness all around about the ability of any institution to mediate not just a political conflict, but a conflict of fundamental values,"" she said. ""That's maybe something like what we're dealing with right now."" The Senate's rancorous fight over Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, she added, has similarly added to pessimism about resolving these conflicts.  In the two years since Mr. Trump's election, protesters and politicians on the left have lamented the erosion of values around tolerance and diversity. On the right, they have continued to mourn the loss of religious and traditional family values at the center of American life. Ms. Hochschild identifies as a liberal herself, and after Mr. Trump's election, she said one of the conservative voters she described in her book sent her an email.  ""She said, 'Well, I guess it's now your time to feel like a stranger in your own land,' "" Ms. Hochschild said. She acknowledges that she has felt this way of late, as she has watched President Trump declare the free press the enemy of the people and question the independence of the judiciary. ""I had no idea we could come this far this fast and challenge things I thought were basic,"" she said. ""It feels like some pillars of our culture are being shaken, stress-tested."" That is precisely the feeling she had described in Louisiana.  On other survey questions, Democrats and Republicans sometimes swap views depending on which party is in power. Republicans, for example, have become much more upbeat about the economy and their own finances, and Democrats less so, since Mr. Trump took office.  But it does not seem, with Mr. Trump in power, that partisans have simply traded views on who feels estranged. And that is part of what makes this moment unusual. Even as the Trump presidency has troubled Americans who didn't vote for him, the president has continued to repeat the messages that helped him appeal to disaffected voters in the first place. And he has told his voters that he and they have not been accepted by institutions like the news media, the entertainment industry, academia and even some of corporate America. ""Trump is continually stoking these feelings of resentment, of loss,"" said Daniel Cox, the research director with the Public Religion Research Institute. ""If you're already primed to feel that way, getting a sort of regular dose of that kind of rhetoric I think would cause you to continue to believe it."" P.R.R.I. surveyed people about whether they felt like strangers in their own country shortly before the 2016 election, and again in 2017. The share of white men with no college degree saying this didn't decline as a result of Mr. Trump's election — it inched up to 49 percent from 48 percent.  The share of African-Americans saying the same rose to 59 percent from 48 percent (almost identical to what Times polls have found). Mr. Cox suggests, though, that while this sense of estrangement has been politically valuable to Mr. Trump in animating Republican voters, the same probably won't be true for Democrats. Feelings of loss on the left — a weakening of values around voting rights, abortion rights, LGBT tolerance — aren't as easily bound together in a singular cultural narrative. The fact that ""feeling like a stranger in your own land"" can encompass all of these values is part of what makes it a powerful indicator of the American mood. The idea touches something more fundamental than policy preferences, more personal than how people view individual leaders. ""This does get at something a little bit deeper, that 'I'm really troubled by — insert your own thing,' "" said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster. "" 'I'm troubled by these political divisions, I'm troubled by how things are going culturally, I'm troubled by crime and the lack of moral fiber.' I don't think this sort of limits you."" There may even be something hopeful in the fact that many Americans are deeply troubled about something — if not the same thing. ""It is evidence of a healthy process,"" said Heather Cox Richardson, a historian at Boston College. In the 1850s and the 1920s, she said, similar moments of widespread disaffection and anger with powerful elites led to broad grass-roots movements that gave way, in their time, to the birth of the Republican Party and later the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. ""It is also evidence,"" she said, ""of an exceedingly dangerous process for the people who are in power."" Nate Cohn contributed research."
News,2018-10-04,"MILLCREEK, Utah — Ben McAdams, a candidate for Congress, was speed-walking along the highway shoulder in his business suit, safety and common sense be damned.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/us/mia-love-utah-republican-woman-congress-ben-mcadams.html,1299," MILLCREEK, Utah — Ben McAdams, a candidate for Congress, was speed-walking along the highway shoulder in his business suit, safety and common sense be damned. ""We'll make it,"" he said, as the trucks whistled by, blowing dust into the Utah sun. In his bid to unseat Representative Mia Love, a Republican, Mr. McAdams has been trying to do just that — make it, in this case to the United States House as a Democrat from a state that runs about as red as the desert is dry. The district he seeks to represent, Utah's Fourth, is a boot-shaped expanse extending south from Salt Lake City where fewer than 15 percent of the voters are registered Democrats. In any other year, a McAdams win would seem improbable. Ms. Love, the only black Republican woman in Congress, won her last election by nearly 13 points, and many voters see her as an outgoing leader in a place where women — especially conservative women — are rarities in the halls of power. She is the sole Republican member of the Congressional Black Caucus, making her an uncommon symbol of bipartisanship in an era of deep division. But this is Utah, where Mormon values dominate political choices and voters largely rejected Donald Trump, whose crass commentary and hard line on immigration clash with church doctrine, garnering him just 45 percent of the vote in 2016. Nationally, Democrats see the district as one of their best chances to move into red territory. And if Mr. McAdams plays it just right, there is bipartisan acknowledgment that he could win, particularly because he is the twice-elected mayor of Salt Lake County, home to 85 percent of the district. The Cook Political Report is now declaring the race a Republican tossup. ""She and other congressional Republicans have failed us in their moral duty,"" said Jordan Roberts, 33, a doctor and former Republican who rushed through a crowd to speak with Mr. McAdams at the opening of a new health clinic near the highway. ""I feel like she's been a yes-man for the current administration."" Now, Mr. McAdams, 43, is crisscrossing the region like a Mormon missionary (he was one, in Brazil), wearing a tidy haircut and a grin and trying to convince voters that he's the centrist alternative to the president, the swamp and anyone tied to them, including Ms. Love. He's focused on bipartisan issues — passing an infrastructure bill, expanding access to health care. And in a gimmicky ad he appears to have copied almost shot for shot from Colorado's John Hickenlooper, he's shown showering in his business suit, promising to clean up Washington. ""Mia Love,"" he said on a recent day at his campaign office, where his cardboard cutout smiles from a corner, ""has essentially taken her vote and handed it over to somebody who doesn't have the best interest of Utah at heart."" But this is a challenging argument for Mr. McAdams to make, given that his opponent is no obvious symbol of the party establishment. Ms. Love, 42, is the daughter of Haitian immigrants, a convert to the Mormon Church who began her political career fighting a mosquito problem in her hometown, Saratoga Springs, Utah. After a stint as mayor, she became the first black Republican woman elected to Congress, in 2014. She frequently criticizes Mr. Trump's rhetoric on immigration. And for many Mormons — who see themselves as a once-persecuted group — she is an important voice to have in Congress. ""He's completely out of touch with what people want,"" Ms. Love said of Mr. McAdams. She has at times mocked her opponent's attempts to cast himself as a centrist, pointing to his past votes against abortion restrictions and his support of the Clintons as evidence that he would push through a liberal agenda. ""It's incredibly important that we keep the seat."" To win, Mr. McAdams would have to sway a sizable number of voters outside of his party. Forty-two percent of the district's voters are Republican, and another 40 percent are unaffiliated, according to data from the political firm L2. Polls show him trailing Ms. Love by mid-to-high single digits. While Mr. McAdams's supporters see him riding the blue wave into Washington, Ms. Love and her staff members are convinced she will return to the capital along with one of her biggest supporters, Mitt Romney, who is running for Senate. ""When Romney is on the ticket, people turn out,"" said Abby Evans, Ms. Love's data director. ""This isn't really a blue wave district."" Utah's Fourth District is its newest, and it includes a sliver of the relatively progressive Salt Lake City, as well as fast-expanding suburbs like West Jordan, where freshly built subdivisions sit amid temples steepled by golden statues of the angel Moroni, all of it backed by the towering Wasatch Range. Residents have elected a Democrat before. In 2013, Jim Matheson became the Fourth's first congressman, after serving six terms in another district. But Mr. Matheson was the scion of a Western political family, and it's unclear if his success can be repeated. Still, liberal forces have gained a small hold in this area, and conversations about the future now include religious leaders, right-leaning politicians, a Democratic minority, immigrant groups and gay activists, as well as developers and technology companies interested in the state's booming economy. Over the last decade, Mr. McAdams, a lawyer and a seventh-generation Utahn, has tried to position himself as a bridge between these disparate camps, and he is well known for negotiating a deal among church members, Republicans and the gay community on a nondiscrimination ordinance. More recently, he led an effort with Greg Hughes, the Republican speaker of the State House, and others, to tackle the region's homelessness problem. Part of his research involved secretly living as a homeless man. For all of Ms. Love's criticism of the president, she has voted with Mr. Trump's position 96 percent of the time, according to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight, a fact her opponent is trying to use against her. But it's unclear if this will be enough. In the Saratoga Springs neighborhood of Legacy Farms, where the homes and yards are as tidy and bright as a movie set, Katelyn Green, 33, was pushing a stroller with one hand and helping her son Caleb, 6, ride his bicycle with the other. She is a Mormon who tends to vote Republican — she opposes abortion in most cases and prefers less spending on social services, she said — and was likely to vote for Ms. Love. She had no problem with the congresswoman's proximity to the president, she said. ""I didn't vote for Trump, honestly,"" she said. ""But I feel like once we have elected a president, as long as they're not making our country terrible and trying to purposely run it into the ground — I feel like: 'O.K., I accept that my candidate lost, let's get behind the person that's there.'"" At Ms. Love's campaign office, a volunteer named Lisa Bagley, 54, called Ms. Love an ""incredibly important"" figure for Republican women at a time when many felt left out of the political conversation. ""There's all this support: 'Women! Women! Women!'"" Ms. Bagley said, explaining that she feels like a pariah at the ostensibly nonpartisan women's leadership events she has attended. ""I feel it's, 'If you're a Republican, need not apply.'"" On a recent day, Mr. McAdams stood inside the soup kitchen where he'd once gone undercover, explaining his approach to a group of visiting Western lawmakers. Outside, State Representative Jefferson Moss, a Republican, said that Mr. McAdams was probably the only Democrat in the state who could win the race. But that wasn't going to change his vote. ""He's got some really good ideas,"" said Mr. Moss. ""That said, if anybody asks, I'm supporting Mia."""
News,2018-10-04,"PARIS — As President Emmanuel Macron presses ahead with the most business-friendly overhaul of the French labor market in decades, his popularity with many of his countrymen has gone into a tailspin. Consumer confidence is falling. A nascent recovery is cooling off. Unemployment has been stuck above 9 percent for months.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/business/economy/mcaron-popularity-tax-cuts-working-class.html,1255," PARIS — As President Emmanuel Macron presses ahead with the most business-friendly overhaul of the French labor market in decades, his popularity with many of his countrymen has gone into a tailspin. Consumer confidence is falling. A nascent recovery is cooling off. Unemployment has been stuck above 9 percent for months. And then there was the encounter with the gardener. In an exchange that went viral on social media, Mr. Macron was seen as lecturing an out-of-work gardener in Paris to look harder for a job. ""If I crossed the street, I'd find you one,"" he told the man, prompting a Twitter storm of insults aimed at Mr. Macron, a former investment banker. That is hardly the vision of France, or of his presidency, that Mr. Macron hoped for when he swept into office 18 months ago with a pledge to revitalize Europe's third-biggest economy by pursuing work-force reforms that had been stalled for more than a decade. His approval ratings have slumped, and on Wednesday his interior minister resigned, the third cabinet member to quit in six weeks. Amid the turmoil, the government is trying to shore up support by giving cash back to the working class — with tax breaks next year worth 6 billion euros ($6.9 billion) for middle- and low-income earners — while reassuring investors that his designs for a ""new French prosperity"" are on track. Mr. Macron remains unbending in his attitude — and his criticism that French society must adapt to thrive. ""I will not change course,"" Mr. Macron told the French newspaper Journal du Dimanche. ""We're in a moment when many political leaders before me have yielded,"" he added. ""But it's more necessary than ever to move ahead with reforms."" His remarks dovetailed with a public relations blitz by some members of his cabinet in recent days, and underscored the stakes for Mr. Macron as he unwinds business regulations and changes the parameters of the welfare state. Mr. Macron has insisted that painful economic measures must come first, including a revamping of France's strict labor code and budget cuts to keep the government's deficit within European rules, to seed dynamism. Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister, said abandoning pro-business policies would lead to a ""dead end."" The 2019 budget also includes an €18.8 billion reduction in payroll and other business taxes to encourage hiring and investment. ""But French people are skeptical,"" Mr. Le Maire told reporters last week. ""We need to explain that this new model will be successful, and that it takes time before seeing the full benefits."" If convincing French voters is an uphill battle, it is especially challenging for Mr. Macron, who is viewed internationally as a dynamic European leader. His policies at home have yet to help most households. In his first year, he delivered tax breaks to corporations and to France's wealthiest 10 percent, earning him a reputation for favoring the rich. Purchasing power fell for the bottom 5 percent of households, while the majority in the middle, about 70 percent, were largely unaffected, according to the French Economic Observatory, an independent think tank. Changes to the labor code intended to stoke hiring have trimmed unemployment slowly. Joblessness has fallen to 9.3 percent, from 10.1 percent when Mr. Macron was elected, but is still more than double the German unemployment rate. Although a nascent recovery before he took office helped generate jobs, growth has cooled recently to a 1.7 percent annual pace, as it has in the rest of the eurozone. Mr. Macron promised voters that he could whittle unemployment to 7 percent by the next presidential election in 2022. To meet that target, the economy would have to grow by at least 1.7 percent in each of the next four years, which is by no means certain, according to the French Economic Observatory. Mr. Macron's economic policies have encouraged companies like Facebook and Fujitsu to increase investments in France. But his style — the confrontation with the gardener is a case in point — has alienated him from working-class voters and older citizens, who view him as out of touch and inclined to favor big business at the expense of workers. Mr. Macron's 2019 budget tries to make some amends. It pivots toward those left behind in the previous round of tax cuts, targeting €6 billion in housing and payroll tax cuts at the working class, on top of reductions in employee health care contributions and unemployment insurance payments. A separate plan would set aside €8 billion to tackle rising poverty with aid and job-training programs for disadvantaged youths under 25. The budget is aimed at ""making work pay"" by leaving more money in workers' pockets. But to keep the deficit in check, Mr. Macron is also trimming benefits for those not working, and cutting over 40,000 jobs in the public sector. Increases in pensions and family benefits would be capped at 0.3 percent a year, well below the 1.8 percent annual average inflation rate. Although 300,000 pensioners who make less than €1,200 a month will be exempted, many older voters are angry about those cuts and are taking to the streets in protest. There are 15 million pensioners in France, and three out of four voted for Mr. Macron in the second round of balloting. The government will also tighten unemployment insurance eligibility and reshape professional training programs to push the jobless into work more quickly. Despite high unemployment, nearly 330,000 jobs are unfilled as employers scramble to find programmers, drivers and other skilled workers. To spur job creation, a new policy aims to increase the number of medium-size businesses in France, which have struggled to grow at the same rate as in neighboring countries. These include cutting corporate social security taxes, and reducing requirements for companies to have union representatives. Yet even the business community has been grousing about Mr. Macron's changes. Some companies are upset about the government's plans to limit the use of short-term contracts, arguing that the policy ignores the needs of the modern workplace. Employers relied on short-term contracts during the financial crisis. The sort of innovative industry that France now seeks — whether digital or manufacturing-based — needs agile and fluid workers, business groups contend. Mr. Macron took pains on a tour of the French Antilles last weekend to appear more down to earth, glad-handing the public and standing in the rain for selfies with smiling crowds. ""I'm not perfect. There are things that need to be corrected,"" he told the French newspaper Le Monde. He also remains adamant that his approach will benefit younger voters — including the 25-year-old gardener who couldn't find work. Mr. Macron listened to his complaint that horticulture jobs were hard to find and gave a rapid-fire response: Be flexible. ""If you're willing and motivated, in hotels, cafes and restaurants, construction, there's not a single place I go where they don't say they're looking for people. Not one — it's true!"" Mr. Macron told the man. As it turns out, the man found work as a bus driver, which Mr. Macron's supporters said showed that jobs were available. The French president is ""taking a gamble,"" said Éric Heyer, the director of analysis and forecasting at the French Economic Observatory. ""By easing taxes on the middle class, he's trying to get away from this image that he's 'president of the rich.'"" ""The measures will either deepen inequality or help growth,"" Mr. Heyer added. ""But nothing is guaranteed to be a success, so it is unclear if he will win or lose the bet."""
News,2018-10-04,"KUKI, Japan — Even from two blocks away the stride was familiar — muscular, insistent, arms low and wide — and the runner could be only one person, Yuki Kawauchi, improbable winner of the 2018 Boston Marathon, hamburger connoisseur and fastest man in a panda costume.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/sports/yuki-kawauchi-marathon.html,2526," KUKI, Japan — Even from two blocks away the stride was familiar — muscular, insistent, arms low and wide — and the runner could be only one person, Yuki Kawauchi, improbable winner of the 2018 Boston Marathon, hamburger connoisseur and fastest man in a panda costume. Already that morning, he had put in 12½ easy miles, looping through a city park while elderly men and women clacked their mallets in a croquet-like sport called gateball. A short time later, Kawauchi was off running again down an asphalt path, wearing a dress shirt, slacks and brown leather shoes. Work started in a few minutes. His office was less than a mile from home. He could time it just right. Each stride on his thick thighs is a defiance of athletic convention, a challenge of cultural norms and verification that the serious can accommodate the whimsical in world-class distance running. Kawauchi will compete in the Chicago Marathon on Sunday, and he will be a cult favorite, regardless of the outcome, a tether between world-class performers and weekend warriors as they run 26.2 miles on the same course. Citizen Runner is Kawauchi's nickname. Even the exertion that wrenches his face in each race suggests a commoner's labor. Most of the world's top marathon runners are full-time athletes who race two marathons a year, one in the spring, another in the fall. Chicago will be Kawauchi's ninth marathon of 2018. As August faded into September, he ran two in eight days. He has also run two ultramarathons. Kawauchi, 31, works 40 hours a week in the administrative office of Kuki High School in his hometown, just north of Tokyo. As a government employee, he can keep his race winnings ($150,000 for Boston) and bonus money but is not permitted to accept corporate sponsorships, including a potentially lucrative shoe contract. That will change next April, when Kawauchi plans to quit his job and devote himself completely to running. For now, he follows a singular, audacious plan. He trains with homemade weightlifting equipment, a steel bar with old running shoes duct-taped to the ends. A bicycle inner tube suffices as resistance training for his legs. He prepares his own sports drink. It is no high-tech concoction, but a mixture of water, orange juice, lemon juice, salt and honey, devised by a local school dietitian. While in Chicago, Kawauchi is sure to do two things besides run. He will eat three heaping plates of Japanese-style curry the night before the race. And at some point, he will eat a hamburger. He worked at McDonald's while obtaining a political science degree at Gakushuin University in Tokyo. (""I could make a cheeseburger in 28 seconds."") Now, he photographs each burger eaten on his travels and makes a note in his journal. If he ever writes a book about marathon running, he may include a guide to gourmet burgers around the world, he said with a laugh through an interpreter. ""We all know a local runner, and he runs two marathons a month and he runs them in four hours, or four and a half hours, because he just loves the activity,"" said Carey Pinkowski, the race director of the Chicago Marathon. ""Yuki fits that profile, but he runs a lot faster. And he works full time and sometimes wears a panda suit."" On March 25, three weeks before the Boston Marathon, Kawauchi ran a half marathon here in a panda costume. At the same race in 2016, he set an unofficial world record of 1 hour 6 minutes 42 seconds for a half marathon he ran in a business suit, combining elite performance and performance art. ""I want to entertain people a bit,"" he said. Such impishness exists alongside a deep commitment to uniqueness — to doing something others are not, and to being one of the world's top marathon runners. Kawauchi cannot match the best with speed. His fastest time is nearly seven minutes slower than the world record of 2 hours 1 minute 39 seconds, set recently by Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya. What distinguishes Kawauchi is the stunning breadth and resilience of his talent. He has run 26 marathons under 2:12 and an astonishing 81 marathons under 2:20, both records. In a six-week stretch early in 2013, he ran the two fastest races of his career — 2:08:14 and 2:08:15. When Kawauchi did not qualify for the 2012 London Olympics, he shaved his head in atonement. How does he recover to run so fast, so often? There is no simple explanation. Kawauchi has a greater capacity to consume oxygen than most elite Japanese runners, scientists said. He also possesses a version of a gene linked to sports performance that is more often associated with sprinters than with endurance runners. Even in his chromosomes, he is unconventional. Given a chance by almost no one, he won the Boston Marathon — the oldest and most prestigious of the world's annual marathons — in frigid temperatures, relentless wind and horizontal rain. Distance running is a consuming passion in Japan. Relay races, called ekidens, can extend more than 130 miles and draw vast audiences, along the course and on television. Japanese corporations fund many top runners. Coaches often have a reputation for being strict, sometimes to the point of bullying. In mid-September, a prominent university coach was fired over accusations that he kicked his runners' legs, grabbed them and threatened to run over them as he trailed in a car during workouts. Kawauchi's mother, Mika, a middle-distance runner and his first coach, made him run extra laps when he did not meet daily time requirements in elementary school. In high school, he broke down with shin splints and sore knees from overtraining. Dispirited, left to carry bags and water for his teammates, he told Runner's World magazine that he wrote in his diary, ""What am I? Human scum?"" In college, Kawauchi found his passion for the marathon, but he also felt constricted by the orthodoxy of training. To relieve stress, he sometimes went to a karaoke club and sang alone in a room for hours. He has adamantly avoided Japan's corporate running system. He coaches himself, with guidance from his unofficial agent, Brett Larner, a Canadian journalist who has lived in Japan for two decades and operates the website Japan Running News. ""If you do everything on your own and have a big success, it's your success, not the coach's success,"" Kawauchi said. ""I'm my own responsibility."" As the Boston Marathon approached on April 16, so did a storm that would make race day miserable. Kawauchi was elated. He excelled in cold and wet races. In late December, he had traveled to Boston to train on the marathon course. On New Year's Day, he ran in a tiny marathon in  Marshfield, Mass., a coastal town where the temperature was 1 degree Fahrenheit at the start. His eyebrows froze and his ears did not feel thawed for days, but he was the only one of the three entrants to finish, running in 2:18:59, his 76th marathon under 2:20. Afterward, as usual, Kawauchi burnished his autographs with the word ""breakthrough."" It would come soon enough in Boston. At 5 feet 9 inches, his weight varying between 137 and 143 pounds, Kawauchi is strong on a downhill, when racing essentially becomes a controlled fall and the best marathoners brake the least as they descend. While Boston is best known for Heartbreak Hill, that is not always the most challenging part of the course. The decisive moments often come later, on what might be called Heartbreak Downhill, much of the final five miles, where the thighs scream in agony. Kawauchi also possesses an enormous capacity to utilize oxygen, according to a measurement of endurance known as VO2 max. His peak level — 82 milliliters of oxygen used in one minute per kilogram of body weight — is similar to that of the world's top endurance runners, according to Masaaki Sugita, chairman of the science committee of the Japanese Athletics Federation. Mikael Mattsson, a Swedish researcher who is leading a Stanford study of international endurance athletes, said it's ""almost impossible"" to find Japanese endurance athletes with a VO2 max above 75. On average, top Japanese runners compensate for lower VO2 max levels with high running economy or efficiency, meaning they need less oxygen to race at a given speed. Kawauchi's running economy is unremarkable, Sugita said. ""Roughly,"" Mattson said, ""it's comparing a Ferrari and a Prius. You can either have high power or you can have high efficiency."" Upon arriving in Boston before the marathon, Kawauchi ran the final half of the course — twice. ""I don't know that I've ever met another athlete more prepared than Yuki,"" said Mary Kate Shea, the elite athlete recruiter for the marathon. Still, almost no one expected Kawauchi to win. In the field were Geoffrey Kirui of Kenya, the 2017 Boston champion, and Galen Rupp of the United States, the 2016 Olympic bronze medalist and the winner of the 2017 Chicago Marathon. But just before the start, Larner, his agent, told him, ""This is the day you were born for."" The temperature was in the 40s, with wind gusting to 35 miles an hour and pelting rain. Still, Kawauchi dressed lightly in his lucky singlet, shorts, elastic arm warmers, a cap and sunglasses with clear lenses. To shake up what he figured would be a cautious start, he ran the first mile downhill in an aggressive 4 minutes 37 seconds. And he kept making strategic attacks. Rupp, the Olympic bronze medalist, fell away and dropped out. Kirui surged into a big lead, then ran out of gas, his windbreaker seeming to provide the drag of a parachute. As Kawauchi made his decisive move with little more than a mile remaining, Kirui was running among some of the top women, who had started a half-hour ahead of the men's field. Kawauchi wasn't sure that he had taken the lead. He still wasn't sure until a race official pointed him toward the tape and another congratulated him after he crossed the finish line. Seemingly startled, Kawauchi took off his cap and glasses and screamed, ""I did it!"" He had won in 2:15:58, defeating Kirui by more than two minutes. Back home in Kuki, Kawauchi's mother, Mika, and one of his two brothers, Yoshiki, 27, also a runner, watched the end of the race on a computer and were stunned. ""What? What is he doing?"" she said. At a post-race party at the Red Lantern restaurant in Boston, Desi Linden of the United States, the women's winner, drank Champagne from a sneaker. Kawauchi danced and played Jenga. And, needing a quiet place, he went into the bathroom and phoned the principal of Kuki High School. The formal news conference for the winners would not be held until the next morning. It would require a change of his flight home. ""Sorry, but I won the Boston Marathon,"" Kawauchi told his boss. ""Is it possible to have another day off?"" Six days after Boston, Kawauchi ran a half marathon. In fact, in the two months after his surprise and defining victory, he ran six half marathons (13.1 miles apiece), one standard marathon (26.2) miles and two ultramarathons, one 44 miles, the other 31 — a race schedule no other elite marathoners would dare attempt. They are left in wonder at Kawauchi's durability. ""I can't imagine going to work the next day,"" said Meb Keflezighi of the United States, who won the 2014 Boston Marathon, the 2009 New York City Marathon and a silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics. ""I can't walk normal for four or five days. I'm walking downstairs backward. I feel like I'm 80 years old. And he's going to work and going for a run."" Many factors affect performance, including training, nutrition, psychology and genetics. Kawauchi possesses a variant of the widely studied ACTN3 gene — the so-called speed gene. But his version, known as 577RR, is more closely associated with fast-twitch muscle fibers and the explosive power of 100-meter sprinters than with the endurance of marathon runners. ""It could be that he's done well despite having the wrong genotype for endurance runners,"" said Yannis Pitsiladis, a professor of sport and exercise science at the University of Brighton in England and a leading researcher on the effect of genes on sports performance. Yet some recent studies have found provisional evidence that the ACTN3 gene may affect performance beyond speed. According to Noriyuki Fuku, a researcher at Juntendo University in Chiba, Japan, who has studied Kawauchi's DNA, the potential benefits to Kawauchi's version of the gene could limit muscle damage during training, enhance recovery, reduce the risk of injury and increase muscle stiffness in his legs, giving him a springiness that could enhance his running efficiency. Asked if he had studied another athlete with such recovery powers, Fuku said: ""In Japan, not really. It's really surprising, something else."" Genes are only one factor, though. Kawauchi has been building a base of running endurance since the age of 6. Because he works, he trains once a day, not twice, as most elite marathoners do. He averages about 375 miles a month, while runners in the Japanese corporate-sponsored system average more than 600 miles. Top runners train to race. Kawauchi often races to train, using half marathons and lesser marathons to help him prepare for more important ones. Kawauchi tries to sleep at least seven and a half hours a night. And he incorporates ultralong runs into his training to build stamina. He has been known to jog the distance of a marathon three times in a week and to run 62 miles, or 100 kilometers, along a river to his home in seven and a half hours. Will Kawauchi will run faster when he quits his job and becomes a full-time runner next April? Will more training miles leave him hurt more often, and less resilient in recovery? It remains to be seen. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics are approaching, but ever the contrarian, Kawauchi said he was not interested. He has struggled running in heat and humidity. It would be a waste, he said, to prepare for the brutal conditions expected in August in Tokyo. ""The Olympics aren't the only destination an athlete should go for,"" Kawauchi said. He has broader ambitions: To run another personal best in the marathon. To win a medal at the 2021 world track and field championships in Eugene, Ore., where the weather figures to be more accommodating. To run as many marathons in as many countries as possible. Unbound by a civil servant's job, he will be free to go off and see the world as he pleases. As a boy, Kawauchi loved to thumb through atlases and read train schedules. But when he began to run, his world turned inward. He said he thought of little but trying to follow his coach's plan perfectly. Now he makes his own plan, longs to try new things, see new places. ""He's a clever runner,"" said Sugita, the chief scientist of Japan's track and field federation. ""He thinks for himself."""

Then there are artists — and it's no vice — who stay the course. They find a style or principle early on, and, like Voltaire's Candide, they cultivate their garden, over decades. They devote themselves to a single color, like Robert Ryman and white, or a single subject, like On Kawara and dates, and in the studio each day they make artworks that are always in concert but never the same. Since the late 1980s, the British sculptor Rachel Whiteread has held firm to one of the clearest and most poetic techniques in contemporary art: taking an everyday item, an architectural volume, even an entire house, and casting the spaces they occupy rather than the objects themselves. In the traditional lost-wax casting process, a sculptor makes a form of plaster or clay, shapes a mold around it, then fills the mold with liquefied metal, once or multiple times. For Ms. Whiteread, objects and spaces are themselves the molds — and are often destroyed in the creation of her ghostly negatives. The air around a large Victorian tub becomes a coffin of vermilion rubber; the voids beneath chairs cohere into colored resin, which the artist arrays like large gummi candies. A bath, a cardboard box, the books of a lost library: These are the molds for Ms. Whiteread's sculptures, mute and mummified. She did not invent the technique (Bruce Nauman, the subject of a massive retrospective opening this month at the Museum of Modern Art, cast the underside of a chair in 1965), and she has modified and fiddled with it at times. But year after year, with plaster or concrete or resin, she has stuck to her impressions of interior spaces and household objects, resulting in weighty, silent sculptures evoking absent bodies and past lives. More than 100 works by Ms. Whiteread are on view now in her hushed first American retrospective, at the National Gallery of Art here. (It was first seen at Tate Britain in London, which organized the show with the National Gallery.) It includes sculptures as small as a hot water bottle and as large as a living room, as well as beguiling preparatory drawings and domestic ephemera from her London studio, laid out like relics. The show is cool, measured and a little too unshowy for its own good. Some of her pale casts get lost in the largest of the triangular galleries of the museum's I.M. Pei-designed East Wing. (Walls painted any color but white might have helped.) The retrospective, perhaps by necessity, shortchanges her large-scale sculpture, too large to travel, and can only evoke her public art in part. Yet I found the National Gallery's show poignant, not only in the traces of memories on her most successful sculptures — but in aggregate, as a model of unshaken artistic commitment over half a lifetime. Ms. Whiteread was born in 1963 in Essex, east of London, and studied first in Brighton (under the sculptor Richard Wilson, who taught her the fundamentals of casting) and later at the Slade School of Art in the capital. At the Slade she began to experiment with alternative casting techniques, and in 1988 she presented a first show with only four works: reticent, Pompeian plasters that employed the humble, abstract forms of postminimal sculpture but left the residue of domestic life just visible. This show reunites the four sculptures from that show, including ""Mantle,"" which hardens the drawers of a dressing table; ""Shallow Breath,"" which appears to be a mattress but is in fact the solidified space beneath a bed; and ""Closet,"" whose plaster volumes are flocked with black felt. (She would soon let her surfaces reveal their striations and pockmarks.) The smallest and most aching work, ""Torso,"" is a plaster cast of the volume of a hot water bottle that suggests, with wrenching economy, an embalmed infant corpse. Though she drew inspiration from postwar American sculpture, Ms. Whiteread's solidifications reintroduced human emotions into abstract art and subtly engaged with love, fear, illness and death. Her early casts also had a social orientation that, it seems to me, gets far too little attention. The daughter of Labour Party activists, Ms. Whiteread came of age as Margaret Thatcher's government was undertaking a wholesale transformation of British society — breaking down its welfare state and privatizing swathes of public housing. Locating politics in the home was one of the achievements of ""Ghost"" (1990), Ms. Whiteread's first large-scale sculpture, which dominates a gallery here: a painstaking cast of the living room of a nondescript Victorian rowhouse in North London. She slathered the walls, the doors and the sooty fireplace with plaster of Paris, then reassembled the dozens of resultant panels — facing out, not in — into a hulking box. If ""Ghost"" is a full-scale death mask of a room and its inhabitants, the sculpture is also a mausoleum for a certain social class, a certain way of life, expunged in Thatcher's Britain. A similarly bereaved gaze on housing can be found in Ms. Whiteread's work beyond sculpture, such as her photo series ""Demolished"" (1996), which depicts the slow destruction of East London's public housing blocks. Seen together, her objects lose some of their strangeness, and the installation of a dozen or more sculptures in some galleries here has a reductive effect. So be sure to look closely at her resin impressions of windows, whose panes bulge out and mullions cave in, or her delicate drawings of the undersides of stairwells, and the individuality of her sculptures emerges. The drawings, especially, reveal how sculpting absence is no rote process for Ms. Whiteread, but a trial-and-error enterprise in which memory and politics fuse in ways she cannot fully predetermine. Ms. Whiteread has often worked at monumental scale, in projects that this show can only evoke through video, photographs and maquettes. A grainy video and a series of black-and-white images relate the story of ""House,"" a solidification of an entire condemned home in a Blitz-scarred area of East London, completed and quickly destroyed in 1993. She and her crew sprayed the interiors with concrete, then ripped off the outer walls to reveal the form within. Other large commissions in London, for the cavernous Turbine Hall of the Tate Modern or the empty fourth plinth of Trafalgar Square, get just a small look in. (New Yorkers may know her ""Water Tower,"" perched on a Midtown roof and visible from the MoMA garden, which transmutes that signature of the Manhattan skyline into a solid of spectral white resin.) Her greatest work remains her Vienna Holocaust memorial, which she completed in 2000, after years of bureaucratic delays, and which this show represents through a maquette. Ms. Whiteread created a room from scratch: a library, scaled like the bourgeois salons of the apartments in the Austrian capital's Judenplatz (""Jews' Square""). The library's walls are cast as negatives and face outward, as in ""Ghost."" But its books are cast traditionally, so that the books' edges protrude from the walls — as inaccessible records of crime, or else as last possessions of the murdered readers themselves. In a way all of Ms. Whiteread's sculptures are memorials, but this one is the most powerful artwork I know to use minimal form in the commemoration of the unspeakable. (It is a far more dignified memorial than its counterpart in Berlin, Peter Eisenman's massive grid of concrete stelae, which has lately become merely a  selfie backdrop.) Earlier this year, I stood in front of the Vienna memorial, not another soul on the Judenplatz in the dead of midwinter. The sky was gray, the windows around the square pulled shut. I ran my hand across the corrugated white surfaces of Ms. Whiteread's silent, stern room, and I held back my tears in front of its doors — or, precisely, its negative casts of absent doors, offering no admission and no escape. There were bouquets of flowers left at the threshold; soon they would wither and later be replaced. What would not wither was Ms. Whiteread's bereavement, the size of one family's living room but weighing as much as six million."

Its executives hinted at deep connections within Beijing's halls of power as well as with China's powerful military. Then, last year, prosecutors in the United States arrested one of its top executives, accusing him of bribery in an effort to secure oil rights in Chad and Uganda. Now, they say, he also explored businesses beyond oil: brokering arms deals in other countries and looking for ways to dodge American sanctions on Iran. In a filing on Tuesday in a federal court in New York, prosecutors said that the executive, a former Hong Kong city official and ophthalmologist named Patrick Ho, had discussed using the company's connections to help sell weapons to Chad, Qatar and Libya. The prosecutors also accused Mr. Ho of exploring whether CEFC could serve as a middleman for an Iranian company to gain access to funds from a Chinese bank under international sanctions. Edward Kim, a lawyer for Mr. Ho, declined to comment on Wednesday. CEFC did not respond to a request for comment. Federal prosecutors did not say whether any of these deals went through and did not press additional charges. But the allegations add a new dimension to what is currently known about CEFC. Virtually unknown just a year ago, it leapt onto the global stage when it said it would buy a $9 billion stake in Rosneft, the state-controlled Russian oil giant. CEFC was a major player in a sector exclusively the domain of big state-owned enterprises, earning a reputation for being politically well connected. Its chairman, Ye Jianming, cultivated relationships with foreign leaders — he was a special economic adviser to the Czech president — and CEFC aligned itself with China's geopolitical ambitions to expand its influence overseas in recent years, scooping up strategic investments in countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Central Asia. But the company has since come under a cloud. Mr. Ye disappeared in China earlier this year. A state-owned Chinese conglomerate, Citic, has taken over many of its international assets. It is now one of a number of ambitious Chinese companies that have turned from a big buyer of global assets to a big seller, as Chinese leaders ratchet back on debt and financial risk in the world's second-largest economy. In New York, federal prosecutors alleged last year that Mr. Ho, a deputy to Mr. Ye and the head of CEFC's think tank, offered millions of dollars in bribes to President Idriss Déby of Chad and Uganda's foreign minister, Sam Kutesa, in exchange for oil rights in the two countries. Mr. Déby and Mr. Kutesa have denied the allegations. Mr. Ho has also denied the allegations. The new allegations focus on what federal prosecutors said was email correspondence between Mr. Ho and Cheikh Gadio, a former Senegalese foreign minister. Prosecutors have accused Mr. Ho of trying to bribe Mr. Déby by presenting him with $2 million in cash hidden in several gift boxes. Prosecutors agreed to drop charges against Mr. Gadio last month and signed a non-prosecution agreement with him. In return Mr. Gadio has agreed to testify at the trial about his knowledge of Mr. Ho's attempt to bribe the president of Chad, who prosecutors said had rejected the cash hidden in the boxes. On Thursday, a federal judge in Manhattan again denied a request for bail for Mr. Ho, who has been held in a federal detention center since his arrest. Mr. Ho's lawyers had argued that the case against him was weakened by the prosecution's decision to dismiss the charges against Mr. Gadio. But Judge Loretta A. Preska disagreed. ""The government's case has been strengthened not weakened"" by Mr. Gadio's agreement to testify at the trial, she said. In excerpts from the emails submitted by prosecutors on Tuesday to bolster their claims about arms dealings, Mr. Gadio is said to have appealed to Mr. Ho to help Mr. Déby crush the Islamist group Boko Haram. ""Do you think CEFC can intervene with the Chinese state to get an urgent, extremely confidential and significant military weapon assistance to our friend who has engaged in the battle of his life against the devils of Boko Haram?"" Mr. Gadio wrote, referring to Mr. Déby. Mr. Ho responded to say he had received the ""important message"" and that it was being ""given the highest level of consideration."" On paper, Mr. Ho ran the nonprofit arm of CEFC and hosted forums about energy security and the ""Belt and Road Initiative"" campaign by President Xi Jinping to promote China's influence overseas. Many of these conferences drew big crowds and featured a senior Chinese People's Liberation Army general and American officials. But according to the United States government, at the same time Mr. Ho was also laying the groundwork for bribes that involved both money and arms, sometimes writing in emails about the risks involved in such transactions. In March 2015, Mr. Ho received an email from a person offering to provide an inventory of arms, according to prosecutors. He told the individual to ""find a way to pass them onto me and we can execute that right away,"" according to the email excerpts provided by prosecutors. It was a list of arms for Libya's military, according to federal prosecutors, who did not identify the person. A month later, according to prosecutors, Mr. Ho sent an email to another individual saying that Qatar ""also needs urgently a list of toys from us."" In the same email, he said: ""For the same reason we had for Libya, we cannot sell directly to them. Is there a way you could act as an intermediary in both cases?"" The two corresponded back and forth about the trickiness of embargoes, according to prosecutors. Mr. Ho then replied, according to prosecutors: ""Qatar needs new toys quite urgently. Their chief is coming to China and we hope to give them a piece of good news. Please confirm soonest."" At one point, according to prosecutors, Mr. Ho positioned CEFC as a potential front for illegal business transactions. In 2014, he discussed the possibility that CEFC could act as a go-between for an Iranian company looking to buy precious metals in Hong Kong using money that had been blocked in China, according to email excerpts provided by prosecutors. At the time, Iran was under international sanctions for accelerating its nuclear program. These details about Mr. Ho's alleged discussions come as the company is slowly being taken apart by the Chinese government in Mr. Ye's absence. Mr. Ye was 25 when he started the company, and well-known within China even before his disappearance. He became the public face of Chinese entrepreneurship and was both a corporate leader and a diplomatic envoy overseas, posing for photographs with world leaders like President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, and meeting with Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, and Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Ho's trial is set to begin on Nov. 5, but prosecutors and defense lawyers discussed with the judge on Thursday the possibility that a delay might be needed to deal with several outstanding issues. In an aside during the hearing, Judge Preska thanked Mr. Ho for providing counseling and advice to a criminal defendant in a drug case whom she had recently sentenced. Mr. Ho helped the defendant, Jonathan Weeks, study for his General Education Development certificate several hours a day for the past several months, according to a filing by Mr. Weeks's lawyer. Judge Preska said the counseling that Mr. Ho had given at the Metropolitan Correctional Center had helped the man. Mr. Ho, seated at the defense table, simply nodded."
News,2018-10-04,"LONDON — Household chores like washing dishes and taking care of children have long been undervalued, feminists and others argue.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/world/europe/uk-housework-value.html,590," LONDON — Household chores like washing dishes and taking care of children have long been undervalued, feminists and others argue. But an official study in Britain has put a price on such unpaid contributions to society: 1.2 trillion pounds a year, about $1.6 trillion. The findings, published on Tuesday by the British Office for National Statistics, are likely to bring a grim smile to parents who accuse their children of using them as a free taxi, with transport services — shuttling children back and forth, for example — representing the largest slice of unpaid household work, at £358 billion. That was followed by child care, at £352 billion. Nutritional services — cooking and serving food — were valued at £158 billion, with laundry set at £89 billion. The overall total is greater than the combined output of Britain's retail and manufacturing companies, and amounts to an average of nearly £19,000 of unpaid work by each person in Britain, whether otherwise employed or not. In reality, however, the value is not so evenly spread. A previous official study found that women shouldered most of the burden of unpaid work in Britain, doing proportionally more than twice as much cooking, child care and laundry as men. Transport, including driving to work, was the only area where men put in more unpaid working hours than women. ""Women are at a clear disadvantage by the unfair burden of the amount of household work they are expected to do,"" said Alexandra Holt, a volunteer researcher for the Fawcett Society, a women's rights charity. ""While it's useful to have these figures available to us, nothing will change before we fix the ingrained perception in society that equates femininity with domesticity,"" Ms. Holt added. The fair valuation and distribution of domestic work has long been a subject of debate, sometimes in the form of a demand for wages for housework. Campaigners in  Italy and in India have called for women who work in the home to be paid a salary. The aim of the study, which covers 2016 and is based on information gleaned from a range of national surveys, statistics and census information, is to supplement the gross domestic product to fully capture the true size and shape of the British economy and the population's living standards, the agency said. ""Our headline measures of the economy focus on paid-for activity, such as when someone employs a childminder or uses a travel agent,"" Richard Tonkin, the statistics office's head of income and wealth, said in an email. ""To give a complete picture of the U.K. economy and society, we publish these additional numbers to estimate the value of activity where there is no payment involved,"" he added. According to the agency's studies, the value of unpaid household work in Britain has increased by 80 percent since 2005. The statistics also show that 2.2 million vulnerable adults were being cared for without charge in 2016, equating to the work of more than four million adult social workers working every week of the year. Vulnerable adults in Britain are becoming increasingly dependent on their families and volunteers for care, with adult social services in many parts of the country under huge pressure from budget cuts and the rising costs of meeting complex needs.

Often, these interventions have interfered in the activities of foreign companies and, in some cases, frustrated the United States' closest allies. But last week the European Union announced a novel plan to evade Washington's reach. Federica Mogherini, the European Union's top diplomat, said the bloc was setting up a ""special payments entity"" that would work to shield non-American companies from the United States' economic actions against Iran. President Trump this year abandoned a nuclear deal with Iran, which included France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China, and his administration has been reimposing sanctions as it seeks to extract concessions from Tehran. Big questions loom over the European Union's plan to create a money-transfer system to help Iran. Among them: Can this entity help sustain a meaningful amount of trade with Iran? Can it be safeguarded from the United States' financial sleuths? Will it require significant use by two of America's biggest adversaries, China and Russia, to really work? The stakes are high for both sides. The Trump administration can be expected to fight any attempt to financially support Iran. The Treasury Department said in an emailed statement this week that the European effort was being monitored: ""We will carefully review alternative measures being considered to circumvent our sanctions and are confident that we can prevent evasion."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described the mechanism as ""disastrous policy."" But the European Union is raring to show that Mr. Trump cannot undermine its most important foreign policy achievements. Defending the Iran accord is an opportunity to do just that. The European Union sees the new system as a way to sustain trade with Iran, in part, to help keep that country's frail economy from going into a tailspin. The mechanism is simple in purpose if not execution: Provide a way for companies to move money in and out of Iran when Western banks won't do that. It also faces plenty of skeptics. Some analysts said the European Union most likely did not expect the payment system to fully develop. Instead, they said, the mechanism is more a gesture by Europe to help persuade Iran to stick with the nuclear deal. But others said the United States ought not to underestimate the commitment of the Europeans, particularly that of Ms. Mogherini, who was involved in the 2015 negotiations that sought to limit Iran's nuclear program. ""She was the one who closed the nuclear deal on the European side,"" said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""The payments vehicle is not just a political gesture. For her, it's much more personal."" Perhaps the biggest challenge to the European effort is that large Western companies won't need the payment entity because they simply won't be doing any business with Iran. Scores of multinational companies pulled away from Iran after the United States withdrew from the nuclear deal and won't want to risk penalties. ""We don't want to take the risk that Total could be torpedoed by President Trump,"" Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive of Total, a French oil company, said in an interview. Total had planned to invest in Iran but shelved those plans this year. For many large businesses, ancillary concerns — such as whether they can get insurance coverage for their shipments — played a role. ""For us, it does not work, I am sure,"" Mr. Pouyanné said when asked about the payments entity. Financial, as well as reputational, risks abound. Multinational companies recall the big fines and scorching headlines that European banks suffered a few years ago to settle accusations that they had evaded the United States' sanctions against Iran. It was reported this week that United States authorities may soon hit Standard Chartered, a British bank, with new penalties related to past Iran business. And France added yet another twist in relations with Iran this week: It froze the assets of Iran's spy ministry after linking it to a foiled bomb plot planned for June. France maintains that it can punish Iran for hostile acts but still remain in the nuclear deal. The Trump administration has decided the United States cannot. The European Union faces a potentially huge obstacle: Banks may not want to have any connections with the payments entity. Banks doing business with it could be subject to American penalties. And if Western banks don't connect to the entity, European companies will have no way of getting money in and out of the payments mechanism. The European Union could try to use a government-owned institution, like its lending arm, the European Investment Bank, to process payments in and out of the entity. But that institution would most likely be vulnerable to United States sanctions as well. Even if the European Union could set up the system, it would have to convince companies that it was reliable — and so secure that the United States government could not penetrate it. Rivka Little, a research director specializing in payments at International Data Corporation, a consultancy, said setting up a payments company would be a huge undertaking. The European Union's entity may be easier to establish because of its narrower focus, but, she said, customers would still expect it to have all the necessary features, like messaging, clearing and settlement. And in an era when payments networks have been shown to be vulnerable to abuse, the European Union would have to monitor it for illegal activity. ""There is one thing fraudsters like more than anything, and that's a new payment network,"" Ms. Little said. Despite all those challenges, the European Union's payments channel might attract enough participants to keep it going. The big question is whether large Chinese and Russian companies would use the entity for business that is targeted by the United States, like trade in oil and gas products. ""It's a very important signal that Russia and China are in this,"" said Mr. Kirkegaard, the analyst. China already has much experience doing business in Iran under United States sanctions, and it appears to have set up a payments channel. According to a prominent Iranian businessman who was quoted in an article by The New York Times in 2016, China's Bank of Kunlun has helped make payments in and out of Iran. (It is also a target of the United States' sanctions.) The European Union may, however, end up deciding that involving Chinese or Russian firms could do too much damage to its relations with the United States. But even if it excludes such companies, the bloc may yet find businesses eager for alternate money-transfer options. Some smaller European firms, for instance, may do types of business in Iran that are not targeted by American sanctions, such as exports of certain consumer goods, and would find the entity provides easier access. The danger for the United States is that the payments mechanism gives the European Union valuable experience operating outside Washington's financial sphere of influence and becomes a permanent part of the international payments system. The Treasury Department email this week showed the United States' concern, and the Trump administration may soon have to decide to respond. Erich Ferrari, a lawyer who specializes in United States sanctions law, said the Trump administration could impose sanctions directly on the entity or pressure private companies not to use it. ""It's going to be a showdown,"" Mr. Ferrari said. ""How far does the U.S. want to push this?"""
News,2018-10-05,"A prominent Pakistani journalist has been ordered to face a court hearing on accusations of treason next week, in a case the country’s press corps says is one of several recent attempts under the new government to intimidate the news media into silence.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/world/asia/pakistan-journalist-treason-military.html,1023," A prominent Pakistani journalist has been ordered to face a court hearing on accusations of treason next week, in a case the country's press corps says is one of several recent attempts under the new government to intimidate the news media into silence. The journalist, Cyril Almeida, a leading columnist for the newspaper Dawn, has been summoned to appear before the High Court in Lahore on Monday. The accusation stems from an article he wrote in May that featured an interview with former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was at loggerheads with Pakistan's powerful military until he was  ousted last year. In the interview, Mr. Sharif appeared to reinforce India's accusation that Pakistan's military aided the militants who carried out the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which killed more than 160 locals and foreign tourists. Mr. Almeida's summons to stand trial on a potentially capital offense for simply conducting an interview was instantly alarming to veteran Pakistani journalists, who were already worried that the country's new government will continue the intimidation tactics favored by the military in the lead-up to the parliamentary election in July. Pakistan's opposition and European observers said the military created an unlevel playing field before the polls, censoring the news media and pressuring candidates to secure a victory for Imran Khan, who became prime minister in August. On Tuesday, journalists, editors and other civil society groups will stage a demonstration against the court's action against Mr. Almeida and what they say is pressure on media organizations to stifle criticism of the government and military. ""This is the darkest period for journalism in the country's history, no doubt about it,"" said Afzal Butt, president of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists. In the months before the election, several journalists were beaten or abducted, with only one thread tying them together: their criticism of the military. In June, the columnist and political commentator Gul Bukhari was abducted in an army-controlled area of Lahore by unknown attackers, including men in military uniform. And Dawn, which Mr. Almeida works for, was prevented from being distributed in military cantonments, which make up large residential areas of most Pakistani cities. Mr. Almeida and the editors at Dawn declined to comment for this article, citing the coming trial. Before the election, while most parties decried the pressure on the news media, Mr. Khan was silent. In an interview with The New York Times weeks before the polls, he said that the pressure certain media outlets came under was deserved, as they supported Mr. Sharif, the ousted prime minister. But in the same breath, Mr. Khan insisted that the news media was free. ""Pakistan's media is one of the most vibrant medias in the world,"" he said in the interview. ""Watch the programs every evening. There are 10 current affairs programs going on; everyone expresses their views."" Many journalists and editors say the current hostility is more dangerous than pressure seen under previous governments: They see it as coming from all pillars of the state, with Mr. Khan's government considered closely in sync with the courts and the military. The military is accused of pressuring the courts to block any opposition — or even criticism — of Pakistan's powerful army, and military pressure was seen as a factor in the court's ruling last year removing Mr. Sharif from office on corruption charges. Soon after the inauguration of Mr. Khan's new government, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry raised hopes among the international news media when he said in an interview in August that he would ease visa restrictions for foreign journalists. But since then, editors and reporters have been on edge. In mid-September, Mr. Khan created the Content Committee, a board to coordinate and oversee the distribution of state advertisements to local newspapers and electronic media. The government is the country's largest media advertiser and has not paid its recent bills, several newspaper publishers said, leaving hundreds of journalists and other media employees without salaries for the past four months. Editors and publishers fear that the Content Committee may favor media outlets deemed to be supportive of Mr. Khan's government while indirectly punishing those that are critical by withholding needed advertising. ""We have to wait and see if this is a monitoring body to favor some groups and curtail advertisement for others that in the past or present were critical to government,"" said Mazhar Abbas, the former secretary general of Pakistan's journalist union. ""The tactics are now different, to financially cripple strong media houses, unlike before where they may ban a newspaper for some time. By crippling the media houses, newspapers are curbing their reporting, reducing their pages,"" Mr. Abbas added. Mr. Almeida is not the first journalist to be charged with treason, and Mr. Khan is certainly not the first Pakistani leader to be accused of hostility toward the news media. During Mr. Sharif's second term as prime minister in 1999, Najam Sethi, a prominent journalist and editor, was beaten and arrested on suspicion of treason after he gave an inflammatory speech while visiting India. He was detained for several weeks, but the Supreme Court ordered the charges against him dropped. But Mr. Abbas and others say Mr. Almeida's case is unique because his treason charges stem directly from an interview he conducted. ""If an interview is now a crime, how can we do our jobs?"" Mr. Abbas asked. This month, the Ministry of Information started a Twitter account called Fake News Buster, supposedly to debunk social media rumors. The move was a chilling reminder of the army's warning to journalists before the election that their social media accounts were being monitored, hinting that they would be punished for any posts that were unfavorable to Pakistan. ""This seems to be a well-thought, sinister move on the part of both government and military to remodel and regulate the country's print and electronic media industry to strengthen the military's narrative about politics and the economy at the cost of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms,"" said Matiullah Jan, a prominent talk show host. The tendency of officials to ""paint critics as anti-state and traitors is pressurizing and endangering the lives of journalists,"" Mr. Jan added."

News,2018-10-05,"ARLES, France — It was 90 degrees at 10 p.m. as the lights dimmed on a stage under the exposed trusses of a 19th-century foundry.

All was silent but for the humming of cicadas, all was still apart from the sultry breeze, and all was dark, except for the green flashing lights on the giant construction crane hovering overhead. The crane, 200 feet high, loomed over a 10-story gnarled tower of steel and glass designed by the architect Frank Gehry. It is the centerpiece of Luma Arles, a $175 million arts complex built on a 15-acre plot of parched earth and defunct rail yard, known as the Parc des Ateliers. Visible from just about every vantage point in this low-lying Provençal landscape made famous by Vincent van Gogh, it is an ever-present reminder that the Swiss art patron Maja Hoffmann is busy transforming this city. If you're not one of the 35,000 residents of Arles or don't run in art circles, it's likely that you've never heard of Ms. Hoffmann. An heiress to the pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-La Roche, this art collector, benefactor and film producer (with a net worth of about $4.2 billion, according to Bloomberg), sits on the boards of half a dozen major museums and galleries, including the New Museum and the Swiss Institute in New York, the Serpentine Gallery in London, and the Kunsthalle Zurich, but she prefers to remain out of the spotlight, behind the scenes. Nevertheless, her influence is felt. ""In French we would call her incontournable"" — essential — said Simon de Pury, the art auctioneer and collector. ""She is one of the most committed people to art and to culture that I have ever come across. She's a rainmaker in the art world."" Simon Castets, the director of the Swiss Institute, described her efforts, as chairwoman, to help the art organization find a new home on St. Marks Place, oversee its renovation, and lead a successful $5 million capital campaign as ""central"" and ""tireless."" But the most self-driven of all her projects is Luma Arles. ""There came a moment 10 years ago when I made up my mind, and said I want to try to do production in Europe,"" she said in an interview in her apartment in New York in August. ""I wanted to put my activities into one place, to have more weight and meaning."" This summer in Arles, it was easy to see the results: Benjamin Millepied's L.A. Dance Project was performing on the open-air stage. A major retrospective of British pop-artists Gilbert & George filled a massive former machine workshop. In La Grande Halle, there were installations of video by Arthur Jafa, photography by Lily Gavin, and a high-tech multicolored light work by Pipilotti Rist. Meanwhile, designers and scientists in the Luma Atelier were concocting innovative uses for local natural resources like the stems of the region's famous sunflowers. Instead of reveling in all this progress, Ms. Hoffmann seemed embattled when I met her in her East Village apartment. She was angry about an opinion piece in The Financial Times that described her project as ""part of the trend for billionaires to circumvent donating to an institution"" and rather ""build the whole thing themselves."" ""It's enough,"" she said, seated at the head of a long polished wood table, wearing a regal red muumuu. ""To be perpetually challenged is not interesting. The media, the people — it's a perpetual scrutiny."" She added, ""This is preventing me from moving ahead."" Ms. Hoffmann is trying to transform Arles through art, much in the same way that the artist Donald Judd reimagined a town called Marfa in Texas, or the Dia Art Foundation rebuilt the upstate New York town of Beacon, using art as a draw and an economic engine. In doing so, Ms. Hoffmann has taken on a role that was once reserved for public officials and city planners: imagining the future and then building it. Mr. Gehry's tower, the future Arts Resource Center at Luma, is central to her goal, Ms. Hoffmann says. She envisions the center not as a static showcase of art, but a working environment where people can conduct research and create projects. It is also a symbol: Mr. Gehry's gleaming titanium Guggenheim Bilbao is known worldwide as the landmark that helped an industrial port city in Spain reinvent itself through art, an impact known as the ""Bilbao Effect."" In a telephone interview, Mr. Gehry said that his idea for Luma was to try to build ""a painterly building,"" to refer to van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" over the Rhone, painted in Arles in 1888. He conceived of a facade made of 10,000 stainless steel panels that would reflect light and color from thousands of angles, so that its surface would shift, shimmer and change throughout the day. Mr. Gehry described Ms. Hoffmann as more of a collaborator than a client. ""She acts surprisingly like an artist,"" he said. The ambitious plans for Luma have met with opposition over the years. She and Mr. Gehry had to revise the design for the tower to win the approval of the city. Ms. Hoffmann also had a public fight with the annual Rencontres d'Arles photography festival, which was, before Luma, the main cultural draw to Arles (with about 125,000 attendees this summer). Its former director, François Hebel, objected to the local government's willingness to give Ms. Hoffmann control over the Parc des Ateliers, without mediating other public considerations, and he resigned in protest in 2014. ""To my great sadness all the public authority people who were in charge at the time just sort of gave up because they were impressed that there was such generosity and they didn't know how to cope with it,"" Mr. Hebel said in a recent telephone interview. ""It sort of crippled people."" Today, Ms. Hoffmann has a working relationship with the Rencontres, which uses some of the Parc des Ateliers' space in the summer. Mayor Hervé Schiavetti of Arles, unlike his predecessor, is a fan. ""As the project is now close to completion, I am very impressed,"" Mr. Schiavetti said in an email. ""The reality is exactly what I dreamed of. Arles has entered a new era of its long history, thanks to LUMA."" When I visited, the complaints I heard from the townspeople were about the tower itself, which some felt didn't fit in to the Arlesian landscape; others said that it was only for the art elite, not the residents. Ms. Hoffmann waved away these objections. ""Of course some people will say it's not aesthetically what I like,"" she said. ""Some Paris people said, 'Why do you destroy our ville de plouc' which means 'town of peasants'? I'm challenging this way of thinking, that's for sure. But I'm more from there than they will ever be. It's not like I want to put my tower in that town. I know the town. I want to produce opportunities for the people who are from there."" Ms. Hoffmann believes that Luma will help Arles become less of a seasonal economy that is dependent on summer tourism, thus helping local businesses. Arles now has an unemployment rate of about 13 percent, higher than the national average of 9 percent. Mr. Schiavetti attributes a slight drop here, from July 2017 to July 2018, ""to the number of jobs created by and around the Luma Foundation."" The daughter of the ornithologist Luc Hoffmann, a scientist and co-founder of the World Wildlife Fund, Ms. Hoffmann moved with her family to this region, known as the Camargue, when she was a child, and went to school in Arles. Her father set up an ornithological station there, founded the Tour du Valat conservation center and became a leader in wetlands conservation. ""I'm first-generation,"" she said. ""I certainly did not try to do the same as my father, but I can of course find some parallels. You engage in the country where you live and you try to say what you think and what you believe in, and discuss it with people. You act along with your beliefs."" After her father initiated plans to build the Fondation Vincent van Gogh Arles, when he was in his 90s, she became an organizing force for the museum, which opened in 2013; she is now its president. She also bought and restored two historic buildings as boutique hotels, the newest being l'Arlatan, designed by the Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo; and she owns a Michelin-starred restaurant using locally grown produce, La Chassagnette. Luma Arles is almost finished; its opening is scheduled for spring 2020. Still to be built is a 10-acre public park with a lake and 500 new trees: a symbol of rebirth, turning the parched earth into a verdant landscape. The last leg of this journey may prove to be the trickiest for Ms. Hoffmann, as she will certainly need to face more scrutiny. She'd much rather focus on her work, though. ""What's important today is to continue to be creative,"" she said. ""I'm not saying I have answers, I'm just trying."""
Review,2018-10-05,"THE END OF THE MOMENT WE HAD  By Toshiki Okada Translated by Sam Malissa 122 pp. Pushkin Press. Paper, $13.95",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/books/review/toshiki-okada-end-of-the-moment-we-had.html,710," THE END OF THE MOMENT WE HAD  By Toshiki Okada Translated by Sam Malissa 122 pp. Pushkin Press. Paper, $13.95 A 30-year-old woman calls in sick to work and stays in bed all day. A couple enjoys four days of no-strings-attached romance after meeting at the theater. Although his plots aren't much to speak of, the Japanese playwright Toshiki Okada's first prose work to be translated into English roams into some dark, even disturbing, crevices of the mind. His characters have plenty of time to delve inward. If this were set in the 1990s, we might call these characters slackers; in Japan, they are members of that burgeoning demographic known as ""freeters,"" a portmanteau of the English ""free"" and the German ""arbeiter,"" which means a temporary laborer. These young people, disenfranchised by a stalled post-recession economy, are conscientious objectors to the conveyer-belt lifestyle of salarymen. More than mere loneliness, it is their alienation from mainstream Japanese culture that Okada explores in his plays and now in this pair of novellas. The first and title story is based on Okada's play ""Five Days in March."" It's set in Tokyo on the eve of the American invasion of Iraq, and captures the global ahistoric confusion of that time. There are antiwar demonstrations in the streets, but the 20-somethings in the story can't seem to work out their responses: ""I saw the protest march today too, and I thought about joining in, but in the end I couldn't bring myself to,"" one says with a shrug. The main character, Azuma, gets stood up at a movie theater, and when he stumbles upon a new love interest at the screening, she nervously asks his name: ""It totally doesn't have to be a real name, just anything, like a screen name would be fine."" (It's 2005; the internet is still populated by shadowy noms de plume.) Azuma isn't into that girl, though; he later hooks up with another and dispassionately decides to shack up with her at a love hotel in Shibuya, the city's equivalent of Times Square. They don't know each other's names, assumed or otherwise, nor do they trade phone numbers or email addresses. These details don't matter to them. Over four days, they never turn on the TV and only once venture outside, when they brush up against another Iraq protest. Instead the pair insulate themselves, talking ""movies and manga,"" going through the motions of a fling without sentiment. Yet the outside intrudes. Azuma recalls, ""We would be licking each other all over, wordlessly, almost automatically, and the image of the march would creep in to fill the space."" ""My Place in Plural"" features another character shirking real-world responsibilities. This second story takes place entirely inside a dank, moldy apartment in one of the capital's less desirable neighborhoods. A wife is home alone while her husband works his second job at a drugstore. She allows herself to mentally articulate everything she dislikes about him, starting with his relentless agreeableness: ""My husband thinks that it's a good thing to be indulgent with me, he thinks that it's a way to be kind, and he's completely blind to the fact that all it does is make me feel worse."" The woman spends time surfing the internet; this leads to an even worse mood. In an experience that will be familiar to just about everyone, she observes that opening a new browser window invariably results in disappointment. ""In the few seconds while the page loaded, I felt like I was holding out hope for something, though I'm not sure what. But as soon as the content came on screen my hope vanished."" Okada's style is hyperrealistic, punctuated with ""likes"" and ""whatevers,"" and structured, like everyday speech, around rambling sentences that often go nowhere. He has spoken of the difficulties of translating his work into other languages, because of its ""super-real"" style.. But this translation by Sam Malissa has a strange rhythm all its own. That ""End of the Moment"" was once a play comes through in its shifting perspective, which moves swiftly, drone-like, among characters. It's the more successful of the two narratives — compact, ruthless, governed by a persuasive sense of dread. In that sense, Okada captures the ennui that has paralyzed a generation."

By almost any measure, the American economy is humming. Gross domestic product is on pace for its best year since the housing bubble of the mid-2000s. Consumers and businesses are the most confident they have been in years, if not decades. Stock market indexes are near record highs. The latest milestone came in a Friday report from the Labor Department: The unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent last month, the lowest since December 1969, when hundreds of thousands of working-age Americans were serving in Vietnam. ""I view this as the strongest labor market in a generation,"" said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the career site Glassdoor. ""These really are the good times."" The turnaround from a decade ago is hard to overstate. In September 2008, American employers cut 443,000 jobs as the financial system collapsed around them. More than seven million more jobs evaporated in the months that followed. Even when the hemorrhaging stopped, shellshocked executives were slow to bring back laid-off workers, sparking fears of a ""jobless recovery."" But when the hiring engine finally kicked back into gear, it did so in historic fashion. The 134,000 jobs added in September made it the 96th consecutive month of growth — eight full years, double the previous record. Employers have added close to 20 million jobs during that streak. (September's growth, a modest slowdown from August, would probably have been stronger absent the effects of Hurricane Florence, which struck the Carolinas in the middle of the month.) Crucially, the recovery is reaching groups that struggled in the early years of the recovery. The unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics are both near all-time lows. Teenagers, less-educated workers and disabled Americans have also made progress in recent months. And anecdotal reports suggest that companies are becoming more willing to hire people with criminal records or to waive drug-testing requirements. Republicans are hoping the strong economy will help them hold off a potential ""blue wave"" of Democratic victories in next month's midterm elections. Friday's report was one of the last before Election Day, and President Trump wasted no time before cheering the news on Twitter. It isn't clear, however, that economic data will have much effect at the polls. Surveys show that views of the economy are split along partisan lines, with Democrats and even many independents expressing less optimism than Republicans. Indeed, the decade-long economic rebound from the financial crisis has been impressive more for its durability than for its strength. Millions of Americans remain stuck in part-time or temporary work, and many of the middle-class jobs wiped out by the recession have never returned. As a share of the population, employment remains well below its 2000 peak, a gap only partly explained by the aging population. Most significant, strong hiring has not yet translated into robust raises for many workers. Average hourly earnings rose 2.8 percent in September from a year earlier, down from 2.9 percent in August and well below the growth that economists would usually expect with the unemployment rate this low. But there are signs that wage growth could at long last be gaining momentum. Before last month's hiccup, the pace of growth had been drifting upward. Industries where labor is especially tight, such as construction and technology, are seeing wages rise faster. Workers at the bottom of the earnings ladder, who were left behind early in the recovery, are now seeing particularly strong growth: Amazon announced this week that it would raise the minimum wage for its employees in the United States to $15 an hour. Amy Glaser, a senior vice president at the staffing firm Adecco, heard the Amazon news on television while preparing for a meeting with a rival e-commerce firm. Ms. Glaser helps companies hire for the holiday season, a task that Amazon had just made even more difficult for them. ""There was definitely a feeling of concern,"" she said. ""It puts increased pressure on them in a market where they already knew they were going to have to make significant adjustments on wages."" Higher pay alone may not be enough. The combination of a tight labor market and rapidly growing online sales has made the competition for warehouse workers particularly fierce this year. Ms. Glaser said companies were hiring earlier, easing job requirements and giving workers more control over their schedules, a big shift in an industry that has traditionally expected workers to show up when and where they are needed. ""The demand for workers is higher than ever, and the supply just isn't out there right now,"" Ms. Glaser said. Christine Specht is dealing with just that challenge. Ms. Specht runs Cousins Subs, a Wisconsin sandwich chain that is struggling to find workers as it looks to expand into the Chicago area. Cousins has raised wages in recent years but still pays well under the $15 an hour that Amazon and other big companies are promising. As the operator of a small chain in a competitive industry, Ms. Specht said, she is reluctant to raise prices in order to pay employees more. ""We can't always run to the menu board every time there's a cost increase in running our business,"" Ms. Specht said. ""That's kind of a last resort."" Instead, the company is looking for other ways to attract workers. Cousins has ramped up its training program to help workers advance into management, offered referral bonuses to employees who help recruit their friends and staged ""hiring blitz days,"" when executives set up shop in a restaurant and interview candidates on the spot. More than anything, they are trying to move quickly. ""You can't sit on applications anymore, because people have options and they will go somewhere else,"" Ms. Specht said. Many economists think the shortage of workers will cause job growth to slow in the months ahead. But others argue that there is still room for the labor pool to expand, as employers become willing to consider candidates they would have overlooked earlier and as higher wages attract people who had been choosing not to work. ""You did see something like that in the late '90s, which is probably the closest analogue,"" said Jeremy Schwartz, an economist for Credit Suisse in New York. ""In a sufficiently strong labor market, you really were pulling people from the sidelines."" It is unclear whether that can happen again. In the 1990s, baby boomers were in their prime working years; today, they are retiring at a rate of 10,000 a day. The number of people being hired from outside the labor force is near an all-time high. Yet the participation rate — the share of adults working or actively looking for work — has been essentially flat in recent years. ""You do see prime-working-age individuals coming back into the labor force,"" said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""But the demographic forces are so fierce that it provides a complete offset."" Policymakers at the Federal Reserve are watching warily for signs that the shrinking pool of labor is leading the economy to overheat, as competition for workers drives up wages and, ultimately, inflation. That could force the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly than planned, which could cause a recession. Yields on United States government bonds have risen sharply in recent days, a sign that investors expect inflation — and interest rates — to rise in coming years. Those concerns have also filtered through to the stock market, where major indexes fell again on Friday after dropping on Thursday. But in a speech in Boston earlier this week, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said he didn't see the tight labor market translating into faster inflation. Friday's report, which showed the unemployment rate falling without wage growth accelerating, is unlikely to change that view, Ms. Meyer said. With the economy in such strong shape, attention on Wall Street has turned to what could bring the good times to an end. Fed rate increases are one popular answer. A trade war is another. Economists and business leaders have warned for months that Mr. Trump's tariffs could threaten the recovery, particularly in manufacturing. There is little sign of that so far, however. That sector added 18,000 jobs in September, and the revised figures erased what was initially reported as a small decline in August. Other measures of the industrial sector likewise show continued growth. ""We really don't have any negative impact from the tariffs yet,"" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist for the consulting firm RSM."
News,2018-10-05,"As airlines continue to shrink the size of their in-flight bathrooms, to make room for more seats in economy, making them all but unusable for tall and overweight passengers, more fliers may increasingly be seeking comfort in places they once avoided at all costs: airport restrooms.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/travel/airport-bathrooms-cleanliness-apps.html,797," As airlines continue to shrink the size of their in-flight bathrooms, to make room for more seats in economy, making them all but unusable for tall and overweight passengers, more fliers may increasingly be seeking comfort in places they once avoided at all costs: airport restrooms. Those dingy, unappealing spaces — often with broken door latches, paper towel dispensers that have long ago run out of towels, and floors that look they like they are in dire need of cleaning — have often been the option of last resort for many frequent travelers. But, now, increasing numbers of airports seem to have recognized that clean bathrooms are an important aspect of travel and have begun to take steps to improve both the conditions and the monitoring of their facilities. ""Bathroom cleanliness is a big driver of satisfaction at airports, and if you want a pleasant experience, clean bathrooms are a must,"" said Dimitri Coll, the associate director for the Airports Council International, the official association for the world's airports, which recently conducted a survey of travelers that emphasized the importance of airport cleanliness.  According to the ACI's ""Airport Service Quality: Airport Cleanliness,"" report, published earlier this year, washroom cleanliness, combined with terminal cleanliness, affects overall passenger satisfaction more than any other infrastructure factor.  There are signs travelers may be closer to getting what they want. Seven airports around the country, including Los Angeles International Airport, Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and George Bush Intercontinental Airport, in Houston, have invested in a new software system called TRAX SmartRestroom, which aims to keep bathrooms cleaner and helps move the lines to use stalls more efficiently (several more airports will introduce the system before the end of the year). Tracy Davis, the vice president of sales and business development for Infax, one of the three companies that collaborated to develop the software (Avius and Tooshlights are the others), said that it involves multiple components and that airports can pick the features they want.  First, each bathroom with the SmartRestroom has a light above the stall indicating whether it's in use: a green light means it's available while red signals occupied. The software also has a counting sensor at the entrance of the restroom that tracks when passengers walk in and leave. Each airport can pick how many people enter the restroom before an email alert is sent to its custodial supervisor indicating that it's time to clean the restroom — say, after 300 people. And, most importantly for passengers, they have the option to leave feedback on their bathroom visit through a tablet at the exit of the bathroom. They can choose one of three faces: ""exceptional,"" ""average"" or ""poor."" If they pick the sad face (poor), the tablet displays a series of six potential issues they encountered. This feedback is instantly emailed to the custodial supervisor who can dispatch an employee to fix the problem as quickly as possible.  Ms. Davis said that airports spend from $25,000 to more than $250,000 on the SmartRestroom system, depending on the level of the installation they choose.  ""The system lets us respond to an issue immediately so that it won't be a problem for the following people who use the restroom. We can fix problems as they happen,"" said Michael Christensen, the deputy executive director for facilities maintenance and utilities for Los Angeles World Airports, which includes Los Angeles International Airport. The airport began using SmartRestroom in April in a pair of bathroom in Terminal Four. (In the coming weeks, the airport will offer the SmartRestroom in all 14 bathrooms that are in Terminal Six.) Two airports in the Washington, D.C., area — Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport — are offering a new app called Inspection Assist that's meant to minimize the chances that travelers encounter dirty bathrooms.  ""We know that there's nothing worse than a dirty bathroom, and this app helps us make sure that ours stay clean,"" said Andrew Trull, a spokesman for the airports. In addition, the Port Authority, which operates the three major New York City area airports, has installed more than 450 FeedbackNow devices throughout its restrooms in the last year through which travelers can indicate whether they had a positive experience or not.  The feedback is provided in real-time to terminal operators and cleaning contractors, who can deploy staff to inspect the restrooms. According to Cheryl Albiez, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority, these devices have collected more than two million votes and have resulted in several million dollars of investment to make the bathrooms cleaner. ""Bathrooms are the first sign if an airport is run well,"" said Jason Clampet, the co-founder of the travel research company Skift. ""I've never been to a well-operated airport that has dirty bathrooms, and anything that an airport can do to prevent bad bathrooms encounters is great for fliers."" "

Plain, gray and near a McDonald's, it's part of a generic office complex surrounded by a vast parking lot in a suburb of Copenhagen. ""Danish Tax Agency"" is stenciled in both English and Danish on a glass front door. This outpost of SKAT, as the I.R.S. in Denmark is known, seems an improbable setting for what the authorities call one of the great financial crimes in the country's history. For three years, starting in 2012, so much money gushed from an office here that it was as though the state had sprung a gigantic leak. Prosecutors in Copenhagen say it was an elaborate ruse, one that ultimately cost taxpayers more than $2 billion — a spectacular sum for Denmark, the equivalent of a $110 billion loss in the far larger American economy. The country had fallen victim to a dubious financial maneuver at the intersection of the tax system and capital markets, a dizzyingly complex transaction known as a ""cum-ex"" trade. The trade is focused on one of the dullest, most overlooked acts in any financial system — the request for refunds on taxes withheld on dividends. Under Danish law, the government automatically collects taxes on dividends paid out by companies to their shareholders. If the shareholders live in the United States, they are eligible for a refund on some or all of those taxes. A tiny department in SKAT, run by one man, approved thousands of applications for refunds. Most of the applications were filed by self-directed pension plans in the United States, a type of retirement account for individuals. But experts and lawyers familiar with the scheme say those people were fronts for cum-ex trades. Deploying a kind of financial sleight of hand, the trades made it appear as if the pension plans had purchased shares of Danish companies and paid taxes on the dividends. Neither was true. To the Danes, it was a fraud, one executed and conceived by Sanjay Shah, a 48-year-old, London-born financier. With an assist from employees, he found the Americans, helped facilitate the applications and ended up with much of the money. Mr. Shah denies any wrongdoing and through a publicist says he merely took advantage of a loophole. He now lives in Dubai, where he owns a $1.3 million yacht and a 10,000-square-foot villa with access to the beach. He has become Denmark's national villain. ""You have this guy, living off fraud, it's infuriating,"" said Joachim B. Olsen, a member of the Danish Parliament and chairman of its Finance Committee. ""The expectation of the Danish people is that we will go after him, no matter the cost."" Since May, the cost has included hiring an American law firm to sue 277 of the self-directed pension plans and their owners who applied for all those tax refunds. But the true toll of this scandal can't be measured in kroner. It has undermined trust in Danish politics and it has severely dented the country's self-image as a bastion of honest, efficient government. An unfolding $230 billion money-laundering fiasco at Danske Bank, the country's largest lender, has only deepened the gloom. What has made the dividend debacle even more painful is that many here believe it was an inside job. The lone employee approving those tax refunds was a lifelong civil servant named Sven Nielsen. After a lengthy investigation, the police learned that Mr. Nielsen had spent a few boozy and convivial evenings with an employee of Mr. Shah's, although they found no evidence that he had colluded or profited in any way. Instead, they discovered evidence that years ago, Mr. Nielsen had helped an old friend bilk SKAT in a relatively small scam. Through his lawyer, Mr. Nielsen declined to comment — from prison, where he is now serving a six-year sentence for criminal fraud in that case. So, Danes are left with a mystery that belongs in a Nordic noir, one with elements of farce and filled with enraging twists. Is Mr. Nielsen a co-conspirator, or a dupe? Is he a criminal or a man so flattered by attention that his critical faculties abandoned him? The other mystery concerns Mr. Shah, who is now rebranding himself as a philanthropist, raising money for autism research by promoting concerts with performers like Flo Rida and Lenny Kravitz. He has been formally termed a suspect by Danish authorities, but to the collective amazement of the Danes no criminal charges have been filed against him. A spokesman for the State Prosecutor for Serious Economic and International Crime would not say why. Instead, with impeccable Scandinavian restraint he said only that the case involves people ""who seem to have used a very crafty setup."" Mr. Shah declined to be interviewed for this article. To offer his version of events, he provided through his publicist a 14-page handwritten letter that outlined his career. And for added personal details, there is a series of autobiographical videos that he posted two years ago on YouTube, titled ""I Am Sanjay Shah."" In each, he sits in a spacious living room in a house in Dubai and muses about his life and business philosophy, omitting any hint of controversy. He comes across as an upbeat, middle-aged expat with an abiding fondness for music. After a midlife crisis, he founded Autism Rocks and became a part-time concert promoter, at one point booking his personal favorite, Prince. Mr. Shah also has a taste for the extravagant. In one video, he said that sports cars parked outside the office at Merrill Lynch, where he worked early on, inspired him to consider a new career. ""I said to my boss, 'Who drives these cars?'"" he recalled in the video. ""And he said the traders do on the fifth floor. So then I decided that I wanted to be one of those people."" Mr. Shah was raised in London by parents of Indian ancestry who had immigrated from Kenya. He dropped out of college in 1992, citing a lack of motivation, and worked at a number of large financial firms. In 2007, he landed a job at the London office of Rabobank, a Dutch company, on the dividend arbitrage desk. There he learned about cum-ex trades. The term is Latin for ""with-without"" and refers to the status of shares before and after a dividend is issued. Cum-ex trades would quickly become the focus of Mr. Shah's professional life. Around the time of the global financial crisis, Rabobank closed its dividend arbitrage desk. While former colleagues scrambled to look for careers in other fields, Mr. Shah boldly opened his own firm, Solo Capital, with an office of eight employees. At the same time, he did something unusual for a man starting a business in London. He and his family moved to Dubai, ""mainly for the weather and the lifestyle,"" he explained in a video. As economies around the globe reeled, Mr. Shah found himself in one of the few growth segments in banking. Cum-ex trades are made possible by tax treaties between countries, agreements that are intended to prevent double taxation. Denmark has such a treaty with the United States. What government regulators throughout Europe failed to foresee was that foreign dividend tax refunds could yield immense and dubious profits. After the financial meltdown, dozens of German banks desperate for a new source of profits eagerly facilitated cum-ex trades, fueled by capital from all over the world. Traders made off with more than $11 billion, according to officials there. Cum-ex would reap fortunes from the governments in Austria, Belgium and Switzerland, too. It took years for the German authorities, who banned the practice in 2012, to figure out what had hit them. The first cum-ex indictments in the country were filed in May. ""It turned out to be one of the biggest financial scandals that Europe has ever seen,"" said Bastian Finkel, a tax lawyer at BLD, a law firm in Cologne, ""and all the more painful because it's public money."" In the wake of their losses, the authorities in Germany didn't bother to alert other countries, and speculators moved elsewhere. The biggest target, it turned out, was Denmark. Under the terms of an American-Danish tax agreement, Americans who own shares in, for instance, Carlsberg can get a full or partial refund on the 27 percent withheld for tax on dividends. Retirement accounts get the best deal of all. They get all 27 percent of the tax back. To scale up his cum-ex trade, Mr. Shah needed individuals in the United States with self-directed pension plans, a type of retirement account that allows owners to invest in a wide range of financial instruments. By 2012, he had found more than a dozen of them — which turned out to be plenty. The names of these Americans who owned the self-directed pension plans became public this summer, when Danish authorities sued them, hoping to recover lost funds. Exactly how these people linked up with Solo Capital is unknown. Mr. Shah's publicist would say only that they came via wealth management advisory firms. There are demographic patterns. Most live on the East Coast, with clusters in New York, New Jersey and Florida. At least five different plans used the same mailing address, 425 West 23rd Street, Apartment 7B, New York, N.Y. The current tenant there had never heard of the Danish lawsuits, but said he had received mail for one of the defendants, Gavin Crescenzo, a previous occupant. Nearly all the defendants have jobs in finance, though one, Michael Ben-Jacob, is a partner at a prestigious law firm, Arnold & Porter. He declined to discuss the case and a spokeswoman at the firm said it did not comment on litigation in progress. Many people have their names attached to dozens of pension plans, which is why there are 277 suits and roughly 17 defendants. A 30-year-old named Roger Lehman, for instance, opened 44 plans in a handful of states, with names such as the Ludlow Holdings 401K Plan and the Hotel Fromance Pension Plan. Mr. Shah said through his spokesman that Solo Capital worked with 200 of these pension plans. He declined to identify which ones. None of the defendants responded to requests for comment. In July, though, an email response came instead, unbidden, from a law firm in Luxembourg called Schaffelhuber Müller & Kollegen. A partner there named Helene Schwiering stated that her clients, whom she did not name, would appreciate it ""if you henceforth refrain from attempting to contact them."" On paper, the owners of the plans pocketed most of SKAT's $2 billion. In reality, these people probably wound up with little or none of the money. That, at least, is the impression of John Hanamirian, a plaintiffs attorney in New Jersey. Until mid-July, he represented defendants in more than 50 cases, then he suddenly filed legal papers withdrawing from all but a few of them. The withdrawal filings were revealing. They stated that Mr. Hanamirian was not paid by defendants named in the lawsuits. Rather, his bills were paid by what he described only as a ""Luxembourg law firm."" And that law firm would not provide needed files about his defendants, ""despite repeated requests,"" he wrote. In an interview, Mr. Hanamirian elaborated. The firm was the one in Luxembourg that sent that out-of-the-blue email asking that defendants in the cases be left alone. ""I needed documents surrounding their involvement, whatever that is — bank statements, investment statements, communications,"" Mr. Hanamirian said. ""The firm wouldn't do it. They said, 'We'll meet you in advance, the day of the proceedings.' I said that's unacceptable."" Before exiting the cases, Mr. Hanamirian spoke to a handful of clients who told him that money went in and then was immediately moved out of their accounts. Whether the defendants earned a fee of some kind is unknown to Mr. Hanamirian, as is the ultimate destination of the funds. ""I don't want any of this to reflect on my former clients,"" he said. ""But the whole thing was definitely odd."" In 2013, all that stood between Solo Capital and Denmark's treasury was the bespectacled, gray-haired veteran of SKAT, Sven Nielsen. After two colleagues retired, he was the last person in the Dividend Department. Complicating matters, he lacked the tools to perform the most basic due diligence when reviewing refund applications. The agency was in the midst of a yearslong and often disastrous overhaul, meant to digitize the system and reduce head count. The priority was helping Danish taxpayers, not foreign shareholders. Mr. Nielsen didn't even have a database to check whether an individual pension plan actually owned the shares it claimed, said Lisbeth Romer, who was Mr. Nielsen's boss until she retired in 2013. ""Sven's job was reduced to bookkeeping, essentially, checking if a form was filled out properly,"" she said. ""A monkey could do it."" There was another problem that nobody knew about then: Mr. Nielsen could be persuaded to break the law. When the Danish police searched his home after the Solo Capital revelations, they found a letter showing that in 2007, he helped an old friend illegally secure $5.7 million from SKAT. (The two men knew each other from the days when Mr. Nielsen moonlighted with a job delivering newspapers.) Last December, prosecutors convicted Mr. Nielsen of fraud for taking a kickback, the equivalent of $315,000, for his efforts. Defenders of Mr. Nielsen maintain that he is a fundamentally decent guy who made a serious mistake under the suasion of a pal. True or not, Mr. Nielsen had a new pal in 2014, just as the SKAT payouts soared. His name was Camilo Vargas. He worked in London at one of a small number of ""payment agents,"" niche companies that handle the array of paperwork submitted to foreign tax authorities for refunds. Mr. Vargas had just founded his own payment agent firm, which he called Syntax GIS. Soon after Syntax began operations, it started working with Sanjay Shah, who eventually bought the company. During the first of several trips to Copenhagen, Mr. Vargas sought out Mr. Nielsen, asking for guidance on how to fill out Danish tax refund applications. What is known about those meetings comes from the one interview Mr. Nielsen has ever given, in a 2016 documentary that ran on DR, Denmark's version of the BBC. Mr. Nielsen appeared to be flattered by the attention and happy to provide advice. He just as gladly accepted invitations to dinner. Mr. Nielsen described in the interview a lively evening drinking beer with Mr. Vargas in a popular downtown area in Copenhagen. ""We walked down Stroget,"" he said, referring to a famous pedestrian street, ""and made several pit stops."" The friendship was fantastically lucrative. In 2014, more than $590 million was paid on 1,500 refund applications. Danish authorities believe most of them came from Solo Capital clients. In the first seven months of 2015, the figures soared to roughly $1.2 billion, paid to more than 2,500 applications — about 16 applications every working day. It apparently never occurred to Mr. Nielsen that Camilo Vargas was playing him. ""At no point did I get the impression that he wanted to trick me or cheat in any way,"" Mr. Nielsen said in the documentary, sounding bereft. ""But that's what it could appear like today."" Mr. Vargas could not be located for comment. The producers at DR hired a researcher to find him, to no avail. In the summer of 2015, the pace of applications made one final surge. In July alone, $500 million in refunds was disbursed — about $25 million per working day, $3 million every hour. Mr. Shah may have had a hunch that the Danish tax refund machine was about to stop working. In May 2015, he met in London with his then-new compliance officer at Solo Capital, Navin Khokhrai. As Mr. Shah put it in the handwritten letter provided by his publicist, Mr. Khokhrai expressed profound reservations about Solo Capital's business, telling his boss that he was unsure ""whether the company was processing the trades correctly."" Mr. Shah assured him that he'd obtained all necessary legal clearances. Mr. Khokhrai was apparently not convinced. He resigned soon after and Mr. Shah stated in the same handwritten letter that his former employee ""submitted a whistle-blower letter to HMRC"" — Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs — ""alleging that Solo had created fictitious client accounts and trading records in order to defraud the tax authorities in Denmark and Belgium."" In August 2015, the dividends stopped flowing out of SKAT, though not because of sirens set off by anyone inside the agency. Rather, it took a tip from the British government to end the scheme, several Danish politicians said. The London offices of Solo Capital were later raided by Britain's National Crime Agency and by July 2016 Solo Capital closed. At the time, Mr. Shah said he had done nothing improper. ""Had they accused a large bank like Goldman Sachs the bank would have kicked back with a large team of lawyers,"" he told Borsen, a Danish newspaper. ""It's easier to target a single individual."" Danish authorities have been trying to unravel Mr. Shah's handiwork for over three years. Much of his modus operandi was revealed, experts believe, in 2017 when police in Germany, who were acting at the behest of the Danes, used a search warrant to sift through the records of North Channel Bank, a small bank in Mainz, a city outside Frankfurt. A team of 60 investigators found that the bank was used by 27 of the American pension plans, which were ultimately paid a total of about $168 million by SKAT. What investigators found is that the accounts didn't actually own any shares of Danish companies, said Prof. Christoph Spengel, who served as an adviser to Germany's Parliament during an inquiry into the questionable trades. He studied the results of the North Channel investigation, issued in a report by a German district attorney. He said that the 27 plans primarily traded with one another. One would place an order to short a chunk of shares of Danish stock — essentially, a promise to buy the shares once they dipped below a certain price. Soon after, an order was placed by another of the 27 plans to buy the order for the shorted shares. That open buy order — essentially, a promise to purchase shares that the other plan still didn't own — was proof enough for SKAT to approve a refund. Once the refund was issued, the buy order was canceled. ""This wasn't a transaction, this wasn't tax planning,"" Professor Spengel said. ""This was fraud."" A spokeswoman for North Channel said the bank was cooperating with the authorities and had no comment. After funds were wired to North Bank, Professor Spengel said, they were shunted to two banks, first in London, then another in Germany. Finally, he said, they were sent to accounts controlled by Mr. Shah and his wife, Usha. Jack Irvine, Mr. Shah's spokesman, said none of this was true. ""Neither Solo nor Sanjay have had anything to do with North Channel Bank,"" he wrote in an email, ""so there appears to be confusion, which is not unusual in this case."" There has been outrage in Denmark over the SKAT scandal but so far the repercussions have been surprisingly limited. No ministers have been fired. The director of SKAT was laid off in August 2016, though Mr. Shah's machinations were among several causes. A new investigation into the cum-ex disaster was ordered by the justice minister in February, which could last years. For now, politicians here seem to emphasize pragmatism over finger-pointing. ""In the past, governments have fallen because of investigations like this,"" said Jesper Petersen, a member of the opposition Social Democratic Party. ""But we have yet to find any minister who saw evidence of this problem and ignored it."" Sanjay Shah is preoccupied with his own troubles. In mid-September, a High Court of Justice judge in London entered a $1.3 billion default judgment against Solo Capital and a company it owned, Elysium Global, in a case filed by SKAT alleging fraud. Mr. Shah's spokesman said his client didn't respond to the lawsuit because both companies are now controlled by liquidators. He also said that at the prodding of Danish officials, Britain, Germany and the United Arab Emirates have all frozen, though not confiscated, $660 million in assets belonging to Mr. Shah. The financial pinch is enough that Mr. Shah has been forced to put his house up for sale, the publicist added. Out of caution, the publicist said, Mr. Shah does not travel. Fears of arrest and extradition are justified, said Henning Sorensen, an associate law professor at the University of Southern Denmark. ""Shah is free as long as he stays in Dubai,"" he said. ""He is like a bird living in a golden cage."""

But until now, such remarks were delivered in private, in fairly decorous terms, and rarely threatened direct action. The surprise this time for Beijing was the magnitude of alleged offenses piled up in one public indictment, ranging from suspected interference in American politics to China's stomping on the freedoms of its own people. Nor had the United States ever before told China: ""We will not stand down."" Publicly, China responded with a certain weariness, calling the speech ""very ridiculous,"" creating ""something out of thin air,"" but also warning that ""no one can stop"" the Chinese people from advancing. Behind closed doors, however, Mr. Pence's remarks probably left few doubts among China's leaders that Washington was embarking on a Cold War that would force the country to dig in for a prolonged multifront battle with the United States, analysts said. The leaders were no doubt angry and embarrassed that the Trump administration went all-out publicly with confrontational language that is considered unacceptable in Chinese culture, which prefers sweet phrases to disguise stern measures. Some of Mr. Pence's declarations, like saying Washington's trade policy most likely caused a 25 percent fall in China's largest stock exchange in the first nine months of this year, could be dismissed as inaccurate, since trade tensions were one of several factors. Similarly, the claim that the United States ""rebuilt China"" over the last 25 years could be shrugged off as dubious and unfair. But it was unmistakably clear that the era of Washington holding out a hand to Beijing to become a ""responsible stakeholder"" in world affairs alongside the United States — a phrase used in 2005 by Robert B. Zoellick, then the deputy secretary of state — was over. ""This will look like the declaration of a new Cold War, and what China may do is more important than what it will say about Pence's speech,"" said Zhang Baohui, professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. China could respond by funneling more money toward its armed forces, which Mr. Pence said spend as much as all other militaries in Asia combined. (The International Institute for Strategic Studies said last year that Asian countries combined spent about 25 percent more than China on their militaries, and that the United States spent four times what China did on its armed forces.) The vice president also singled out a near collision on Sunday in the South China Sea, where a Chinese warship cut off an American destroyer, missing it by less than 45 yards. China has kept its military budget at 1.5 percent of its economic output over the last few years. ""It has a long way to go to reach the U.S. level of 3.5 to 4 percent,"" Mr. Zhang said. [Discuss China's role in the world with New York Times journalists in a new Facebook group here.] China could also reverse course on its support of the American-led effort in the United Nations that has imposed heavy sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. China's leader, Xi Jinping, signaled last month that he would not buckle to Washington's trade demands when he visited vast grain-growing areas of northeast China, stressing the need for China to be self-reliant, a policy harking back to the Cold War era of Mao Zedong 50 years ago. Chinese policymakers, following Mr. Xi's strictures, are unlikely to give ground, said Yun Sun, a policy expert at the Stimson Center in Washington who is currently visiting China. ""My comments to the Chinese are that maybe China should tone down its assertiveness to avoid further tension,"" Ms. Sun said of her discussions with Chinese officials. ""And the reaction I get is that 'We don't think we are being assertive.'"" President Trump said last week that the friendship with Mr. Xi that he once was so proud of may now be over. The feeling was most likely reciprocated in the aftermath of the speech, Ms. Sun said. ""I don't think Xi still sees Trump as his friend."" China's social media platforms, which the government rigorously censors, eliminating provocative content, bristled in shock at the severity of Mr. Pence's speech. ""Pence's speech is really earth-shattering,"" said one commenter. ""This is the official speech of the U.S. I suggest every Chinese person read the whole thing. Is this another edition of the 'Iron Curtain' speech?"" Mr. Pence's speech was clearly directed at a domestic audience. He gave it at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group, and its timing — 11 p.m. in China — meant it probably had limited viewership in China, mostly among international affairs specialists. And it was given in the midst of a weeklong holiday in China, when the government's most strident megaphone for foreign policy, the state-run newspaper Global Times, is not publishing. Still, the unfavorable comparison with accusations of Russian interference in American politics probably alarmed Chinese officials, said Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former member of the National Security Council in the Obama administration. ""The vice president attempted to shift public scrutiny from Russia to China,"" Mr. Hass said. ""He asserted that Russian efforts to interfere in America's electoral process 'pales in comparison to what China is doing.'"" But the address could reassure two nations that fear China — Japan, an important American ally, and India, a country that Washington is trying to bring closer — regional analysts said. And the tougher approach reflects a growing wariness of China among American businesses. ""This has been building for a long time across different sectors in the U.S. — the military and business in particular,"" said Bilahari Kausikan, a former foreign secretary for Singapore. ""American business is particularly significant as it had been the stabilizing fact. But their mood has been souring for a decade or more. How the Chinese missed this, I do not know."" In Australia, another important American ally, the government has been saying many of the same things as Mr. Pence, though in more muted tones. In some ways, Australia has been viewed in Washington as a test case of what China could get away with in a country with a strong economy and Western values. The American and Australian intelligence agencies have consulted on what they see as the China threat. Allegations of Chinese meddling in Australian universities and donations to political campaigns by ethnic Chinese businessmen connected to the government in Beijing have prompted recent legislation aimed at curbing foreign interference in Australia's domestic affairs. But the Australians have couched their new legislation in general terms, never singling out China. Mr. Pence's harder line is likely to ignite a debate in Australia about whether it, too, should take a harder line against China. ""Let's take the heat, light, noise and excitement out of the relationship by establishing a clear, declared policy that governs our approach to the economic and strategic relationship with the Chinese state,"" said Michael Shoebridge, director of defense at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Australia should follow in Mr. Pence's footsteps, he said. But there were concerns about pushing too far. ""I think Australia is broadly comfortable with the Pence approach,"" said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University. ""There is just a worry about it getting out of control."""
News Analysis,2018-10-06,"WASHINGTON — He promised so much success that everyone would be tired of all the winning. But after 20 months that proved more arduous than President Trump once imagined, this may be the best week of his presidency so far.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/us/politics/trump-kavanaugh-nafta.html,1222," WASHINGTON — He promised so much success that everyone would be tired of all the winning. But after 20 months that proved more arduous than President Trump once imagined, this may be the best week of his presidency so far. The imminent confirmation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court will cap a week that also saw the president seal an ambitious and elusive new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, one of his top campaign promises. And the latest jobs report out on Friday put unemployment at its lowest since 1969. None of this necessarily changes the fundamentals of an often-chaotic presidency that has defied norms and struggled with scandal, but it gives Mr. Trump a fresh narrative to take on the campaign trail just a month before critical midterm elections that will determine control of Congress. With the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, turning quiet during campaign season, Mr. Trump has an opportunity to redirect the conversation onto more favorable territory. ""From his standpoint, it's been a good week after many bad ones,"" said David Axelrod, who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama. ""For a self-proclaimed perpetual 'winner,' he will have had some big wins to tout. The jobs figure, other than wages, and the after-Nafta agreement are positive."" Still, in Mr. Trump's scorched-earth presidency, even victories come at a cost. The relationship with Canada was deeply scarred by his brutal negotiating tactics, while America has been ripped apart by the battle over Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, fraught as it was with gender politics that Mr. Trump seemed eager to encourage and anger on the left and the right. ""The impact of Kavanaugh is more of a mixed bag, further inflaming both sides, which could help him retain or even expand his Senate margin but further imperil the House,"" Mr. Axelrod said. Mr. Trump is the first president in American history never to have held public office or served in the military, and his inexperience has shown at times. Unfamiliar with the workings of government, legislation or diplomacy, he has often been stymied in his efforts to achieve goals like repealing Mr. Obama's health care law, toughening immigration regulations, building a wall along the Mexican border or bringing peace to the Middle East. Until recent days, he proved more effective at blowing up agreements than reaching new ones. He pulled out of an Asian-Pacific trade pact, a global accord on climate change and a nuclear deal with Iran, but has made no progress in negotiating replacements, as he suggested he would. His most significant legislative achievement was last year's tax-cutting package, which was forged in large part by Republican congressional leaders who had their own reasons for pushing it through. The past couple of weeks, however, saw Mr. Trump seal a revised trade agreement with South Korea and replace the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which not long ago seemed as though it might be beyond his reach. The continuing fall in unemployment to 3.7 percent was built on the recovery he inherited from Mr. Obama — something he refuses to acknowledge — but the  booming economy has become one of his strongest political assets. And with Judge Kavanaugh nearing confirmation on Saturday, he showed he could push through an important nomination that many predicted was likely to fail after allegations of sexual misconduct. ""It's a wonderful week. We're thrilled,"" Kellyanne Conway, his counselor, said in an interview. ""It shows that his perseverance and his tenacity and his adherence to campaign promises and principles are paying dividends."" Some Republican activists said Mr. Trump had shown that defying conventional wisdom could work. ""President Trump has made a ton of gambles,"" said Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist, a conservative news site. ""Most of them have paid off. Even a bad gambler can get on a hot streak. The measure of a good gambler is what happens when the dice cool down."" The cause for celebration in the White House, of course, was cause for mourning among his opponents. In the view of his critics, he will be putting a man credibly accused of sexual assault on the nation's highest court, he blew up friendships with America's neighbors for a new trade deal whose actual impact has been exaggerated, and he has appropriated credit for the economy from Mr. Obama while ballooning the deficit in a way that conservatives have until now always condemned. James J. Blanchard, an ambassador to Canada under President Bill Clinton, attended the groundbreaking of a new bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, on Friday and said that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada ""was upbeat"" following the new trade deal. Mr. Trump was right to update the trade agreement, he said, although ""it probably could have been done six months ago without the cheap theatrics,"" and now ""everyone knows we need to repair relations, but no one expects Mr. Trump to do that."" Whether the string of success for Mr. Trump will translate into support on the campaign trail could be the defining test of the next few weeks. Mr. Trump's own approval ratings remain mired at just over 40 percent in most polls, a historically low level for a president that usually signals losses for his party this close to an election. ""Independents especially are tired of the chaos and the uncertainty,"" said Patti Solis Doyle, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in 2008. ""Yes, the economy is good; yes, Trump got two conservative judges on the court; and, yes, he is doing what he promised on the campaign trail"" in terms of trade, tax cuts and tougher immigration enforcement. ""But at what cost?"" she asked. ""Tariff wars, separating children from their mothers, huge deficit. I can go on and on."" Mr. Trump plans to take his case on the road with a frenetic burst of campaigning in the weeks to come. He heads to Kansas on Saturday and will be on the road six of the next eight days, mainly for boisterous arena rallies where he rouses his conservative base with red-meat speeches. Midterm elections are about turnout, and Democrats have been more energized for months, intent on stripping Mr. Trump of his party's control of the House and possibly the Senate. While conservatives had grown more animated over the battle for Judge Kavanaugh, once he is confirmed, Democrats may be more motivated to vote out of anger at the outcome, especially women who are upset that allegations of sexual assault were disregarded. And it is not at all clear that when it comes to promoting his strongest political points, Mr. Trump can stay on message. Even this week, as he highlighted the new trade agreement, which he is calling the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or U.S.M.C.A., he drifted off to other subjects, as he is wont to do. One truism of the Trump presidency has been how quickly the story line changes from week to week, or day to day. New tales of palace intrigue or flare-ups of international tension or revelations stemming from various investigations could easily swamp a message of progress by the Nov. 6 election. As Mr. Axelrod said, it is not clear ""how any of this will factor in a month from now, which is an eternity in the Age of Trump."""
Op-Ed,2018-10-06,"Last week I interviewed Colombian President Iván Duque, who took office in August and calls himself a man of the “extreme center.” In an era of rising populism, I asked, how should politicians make the case for reviving or strengthening centrist-style politics?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/opinion/colombia-president-duque-populism.html,841," Last week I interviewed Colombian President Iván Duque, who took office in August and calls himself a man of the ""extreme center."" In an era of rising populism, I asked, how should politicians make the case for reviving or strengthening centrist-style politics? ""When you see a populist,"" Duque answered, ""you always see a demagogue. Societies no longer need demagogues; they need pedagogues — people that can tell a country, 'Where is it that we want to go, how is it that we want to make it happen, and what is it that everybody has to put in the basket to achieve those goals?' "" Colombians have something to teach the rest of us about the need to preserve a vital political center. Long before cocaine wars and guerrilla insurgencies nearly destroyed Colombia in the 1980s and '90s, some 200,000 people perished in a civil war in the 1940s through the '60s because the country's liberals and conservatives couldn't settle their ideological differences peacefully. Politics played as blood sport degrades personal manners and ruins civic institutions. That's where we are in the United States today. Left unchecked, it blows up countries. Colombians know, because it has taken them three generations to work their way out of the wreckage, and they're far from done. Colombians also know something about demagogic populism, having seen its effects play out in neighboring Venezuela since Hugo Chávez began his ""Bolivarian Revolution"" nearly 20 years ago. Today, Colombia is bearing the brunt of the worst refugee crisis in recent Latin American history, as close to one million Venezuelans have poured across the border in less than two years, seeking relief from widespread starvation and the violent authoritarianism of Chávez successor Nicolás Maduro.  This is the same Bolivarian Revolution that was enthusiastically embraced by Jeremy Corbyn, Naomi Klein, Michael Moore, Oliver Stone, Cornel West and other comfortable tribunes for democratic socialism in the West. Anyone who thinks that left-wing populism is the appropriate remedy for the right-wing variety should look at Venezuela — where the health care is universal and, thanks to socialist shortages, there's none of it.  Colombia's effort to steer clear of both should be an inspiration. The refugee crisis has put immense pressure on its vulnerable economy. But Duque has refused to scapegoat the migrants or turn his back on them. ""We will never close our borders,"" he says, ""because we want to build this fraternity and because we know that this is a bigger challenge."" What a difference between Duque's approach and the ""build the wall and imprison the kids"" crowd currently in power in Washington, Budapest, Rome and other right-wing redoubts. What a difference, too, with the simplistic humanitarianism of Angela Merkel, whose ""let them in"" approach to the Syrian refugee crisis accounts for much of the anti-immigrant backlash and was never paired with a serious attempt to end the crisis at its Syrian source.  Instead, Duque is calling forthrightly for maximum pressure on Caracas, with a clear view toward ending Maduro's rule. He disavows military solutions ""because that is what the dictator wants."" But he's fairly explicit in calling on Venezuelans to take matters in their own hands, and even more so in applying crushing sanctions on the regime. ""Martin Luther King used to say that silence can turn you into an accomplice,"" he says. ""The stage where we are right now is the stage where we can no longer be indifferent. The whole international community must react."" Duque has also not been silent about the failings of Colombia's vaunted peace deal with the Marxist rebels of the FARC — the deal that delivered the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize to Duque's predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos, even as it was rejected by Colombians in a referendum. Last month, The Times reported that rebels are once again taking up arms while their leaders again take up drug trafficking.  Those of us who are skeptics of peace deals with terrorists would say: ""Told you so."" Duque is committed to keeping but amending the accords. But he complains about the way in which the word ""peace"" was manipulated by his predecessor into a partisan wedge issue by treating opponents of the agreement as ""enemies of peace."" In the age of Trump, it's easy to forget that elitism and demagoguery can also mix with noxious results. Anyone tagged a ""warmonger"" simply because they thought the Iran deal was badly negotiated knows the feeling. We are now at a moment when populist demagogues of right or left have won or made major gains in nearly every important recent election: in Pakistan and Mexico; Italy and Sweden; the U.K. and the U.S. It might yet happen again this month in Brazil. To debate the overarching causes is somewhat useless. Unhappy families, to borrow Tolstoy's line, are unhappy in their own way. Then again, happy families are alike, and so are countries. Reclaiming the extreme center is the way it's done, and Colombia has lessons worth learning.

News,2018-10-06,Anyone who has been closely watching the Trump administration’s strategy for remaking global trade might have reasonably believed at times that it had no strategy for remaking global trade. ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/upshot/trump-trade-strategy-coming-into-focus.html,1181," Anyone who has been closely watching the Trump administration's strategy for remaking global trade might have reasonably believed at times that it had no strategy for remaking global trade.  But that has changed in recent weeks, with a more coherent approach starting to become apparent — though not one with any guarantee of success. The strategy that has jelled goes something like this: The president has been beating up on traditional allies, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. He has been assailing them publicly, placing tariffs on their steel and aluminum, and threatening to tax their automobiles. But fundamentally, that was just about softening them up to extract moderate concessions favorable to American interests. That has now been achieved with a trade deal with South Korea in late September and a new Nafta, now to be called U.S.M.C.A. (for United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), struck last weekend.  Now that the administration has shown it can get to yes with those deals, similarly patterned agreements with Europe and Japan are expected to come next. After revised deals with those allies are in place, the administration will most likely seek a concerted effort among them to isolate China and compel major changes to Chinese business and trade practices.  The ultimate goal, in other words, is to reset the economic relationship between China and the rest of the world. It may take time and cause pain in the interim. But the idea is it's a multistep process to attain more leverage with which to force China to allow American companies to sell their goods and operate freely, without having their technology stolen. And it bolsters the United States in a geopolitical rivalry with China that is becoming more tense, as Vice President Pence articulated in a speech last week. One telling piece of evidence for this strategy: a provision in the new North American deal that will make it hard for Mexico or Canada to negotiate a trade deal with a ""nonmarket"" economy like China without risking their favored access to the United States' huge market. Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, outlined this strategy at the Economic Club of Washington on Thursday. ""China is first and foremost,"" he said at one point. ""There's a lot of unfair trading practices, and the biggest culprit is China,"" he said. The administration was able to complete the new North American deal, he said, with ""a combination of pressure and negotiations."" ""We are talking to the European Union again, we are talking to Japan again, and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China,"" Mr. Kudlow said. (He didn't note that he'd borrowed a term also used for the allies that joined in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which President Trump has called a disaster.) The sense among analysts that the administration has been pursuing a single coherent strategy contrasts with earlier in the year. At that point, from the outside at least, the administration seemed to be changing its approach by the week, and sometimes by the day. It has often seemed that there has been a series of improvised moves, with different senior officials favoring different approaches. Steel and aluminum tariffs were to be applied to all imports, then close allies were exempted, until two months later when they weren't. There seemed to be a deal to increase Chinese imports of American agricultural and energy products, achieving trade peace — which crumbled days later, as President Trump changed course and demanded more profound changes in the Chinese economy and trade practices. Now, with the new North American deal, it's become easier to see how the different elements of Trump trade fit together. The ""nonmarket"" provision seems devised to give the United States veto power over any deal Canada or Mexico might seek with China. But just because there is a more coherent strategy in the administration's stance toward global trade than in the recent past doesn't mean it will work. And there are still plenty of reasons for skepticism. ""I do think we can see a strategy, but that doesn't mean it's a good strategy,"" said Mary E. Lovely, a professor at Syracuse University and a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""They're going to use these bilateral deals to strong-arm countries into lining up behind the U.S. on China. But when we get there, what's the next step? I don't know what the endgame is."" Some items on the Trump administration's list of demands in negotiations with the Chinese seem unlikely to be met, as they would compel China to abandon its entire strategy to modernize its economy. For example, one demand is for China to halt its subsidies for its ""Made in China 2025"" program aimed at giving its companies a foothold in aircraft, robotics and other areas of advanced manufacturing. There's a risk that even if the effort to isolate China succeeds, the result might be simply a bifurcated world trade system in which there is one orbit of countries with close ties to the United States, and another tied to China, with minimal overlap. A crucial question is whether the administration's strategy of pummeling allies with attacks, threats and tariffs can yield not just revised trade agreements, but also the trust needed to undertake a concerted campaign against China. Ms. Lovely jokes that it would really be the ""coalition of the coerced"" rather than Mr. Kudlow's ""coalition of the willing."" The scars and bruises from negotiations this year could linger, compounded by the Trump administration's disinclination to engage in multilateral negotiations with many parties at once. The new North American deal, a case study in such unwillingness, shares many elements with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was negotiated by the Obama administration and abandoned by the Trump administration in early 2017. The whole agreement was intended as a strategic counterweight to Chinese economic power in the Pacific Rim. But rather than reopen the T.P.P., the Trump administration chose the path of separate deals with each country. The bet is that the United States will have greater negotiating leverage in a series of bilateral deals with allies than it would in some large multicountry agreement — even if many of the details of agreements end up looking similar, as was the case with the new U.S.M.C.A. The risk of that approach is that when the United States hammers out each deal separately, it may be hard to then turn around and create any kind of unified pressure against China. ""To go into battle, together, you need to know that a partner is reliable, that if they tell you something, they'll stick to it,"" said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ""This administration has been anything but reliable on trade policy."" Still, a few things are apparent now that were not at all clear at the beginning of the summer. The Trump administration isn't just looking to blow things up; so long as negotiators can claim victory for American interests, there are deals to be had for allies. And unpleasant as trade skirmishes with Europe or Canada or Japan may be, they're really a warm-up for a trade war with China."

A teenage boy killed by a stray bullet while watching television. Outbursts of gunfire so frequent that children call them “frying popcorn.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/world/africa/cameroon-election-biya-ambazonia.html,1578," BUEA, Cameroon — A soldier's crumpled corpse at a traffic circle. Young men gunned down in their living room while partying. A teenage boy killed by a stray bullet while watching television. Outbursts of gunfire so frequent that children call them ""frying popcorn."" The horrors residents recount here at the base of cloud-covered Mount Cameroon are part of a conflict that has been upending the English-speaking regions of this country in recent months. ""This situation, it's unbearable,"" said Leonard Etuge, one of the few holdouts still living in a once-bustling neighborhood along a highway called Mile 16 that is now littered with charred, overturned vehicles and shell casings. Cameroon is still grappling with a tangled colonial past that involved three European powers — Germany, France and Britain — and in recent years, it has become a vital partner of the United States in the battle against Islamist extremism in Africa. Now, the country is on the brink of civil war. Longstanding anger at the government has erupted into one of the nation's biggest uprisings in decades. Separatists are waging a violent battle to break away and form their own country, called Ambazonia. The estimated 2,000 fighters are armed mostly with homemade guns and take orders from activists living overseas. Known locally as ""Amba boys,"" the separatists are up against an American- and Israeli-trained elite military force that has been widely accused of human rights abuses. The government crackdown has been ruthless, with residents and local officials providing frequent accounts of troops burning homes and buildings in more than 100 villages, indiscriminately shooting or detaining civilians, and sometimes executing innocent young men as they search for separatists who scurry away into the dense forest after attacks. Tens of thousands of people have fled English-speaking areas to get away from the violence and about 400 civilians have died, according to an Amnesty International estimate, a figure that doesn't include security forces and separatists who have been killed in battle. In the middle of this melee, the country is trying to hold an election. One of the world's longest-serving presidents, Paul Biya, 85, who has already been in office 36 years, is asking voters to give him seven more on Sunday. Mr. Biya has been in office so long that most of the nation's population has known no other leader. Mr. Biya has been traveling the country to rally support in a contest expected to be highly lopsided, given his tight grip on the nation. Separatists have vowed to do all they can to disrupt the vote, escalating an already volatile situation. 200 miles chad NIGERIA Bamenda CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC cameroon Yaoundé Area of detail CONGO REPUBLIC Gulf of Guinea GABON MT. CAMEROON Ekona N8 Buea N3 cameroon 10 miles By The New York Times Cameroon is already fighting another war — against Islamist extremists in the region. In the north, Americans have provided the country with military equipment to battle Boko Haram as the war has spilled across the Nigerian border. Mindful of its shaky international reputation, Mr. Biya's government has hired a Washington public relations firm, after another signed and then quickly dropped him as a client. But the election will do little to settle the uprising against Mr. Biya in Cameroon's two English-speaking regions, contiguous areas along the Nigerian border. Turnout in them is expected to be extremely low — largely because few people are left to vote. In some areas, locals officials estimate more than 90 percent of residents have fled. Communities like Ekona, a small town near a dormant rubber plantation, have been completely abandoned. Burned homes, crushed tin shacks that housed businesses and a blackened beer truck attest to the fierce battles here. Many of the concrete homes and stores along the road were riddled with large bullet holes. Ekona had been a flash point of fighting. A military captain blamed separatists for the damage, accusing them of lashing out at residents who didn't respect their calls to create a ""ghost town,"" by abandoning the streets and staying home. But local news reports offered a much different explanation: a gun battle between separatists and security forces in June that sent residents escaping into the forest. English-speaking areas make up a fifth of the population, and with their palm oil, rubber and banana plantations they are a significant contributor to Cameroon's economy. Most of those operations are now closed because of the violence. Residents of Anglophone areas began protesting two years ago, saying they were tired of teachers and judges who did not speak English well but were being appointed to their schools and courts nonetheless. After the government's security forces opened fire on people at rallies, separatists armed themselves. The protests were part of a broad sense of marginalization that had been mounting since the post-World War I era, when the League of Nations appointed France and England as joint trustees of what was then German Kamerun. Colonialists pushed their own cultures on each region. Though the nation officially recognizes both languages, Mr. Biya, who governs from the French-speaking capital of Yaoundé, has concentrated power and resources in Francophone areas, while people in Anglophone regions complain bitterly about unpaved roads and a lack of other infrastructure. The campaign posters of Mr. Biya plastered across the country and T-shirts handed out on street corners only reinforce the gulf between the two sides. In a nod to his experience, one of his campaign slogans is ""The Power of Experience."" But for English-speaking voters, the posters translate the slogan awkwardly, saying ""The Force of Experience"" instead — an ominous echo of the violence being waged in English-speaking areas. ""To make that kind of mistake,"" sighed Derick Woteva Wambo, the chief in a neighborhood in Buea, an English-speaking city. ""Oh, this whole country."" Mr. Wambo estimated that only about 10,000 of Buea's 200,000 residents remain in the city, a normally quaint mountainside area where the violence has been unrelenting. Many fled after episodes like one Mr. Wambo witnessed last week. At 6:30 a.m. on Sept. 27, he said he was called to a home where he found the bodies of six men strung across a living room, some limp across chairs and one lying by a door as though he was trying to escape. Another body had already been taken to the morgue. Before they died, the men were having a party, smoking marijuana in the early morning hours and making noise, Mr. Wambo said. He said security forces heard the racket and executed them after deciding they were separatists, who are rumored to be heavy smokers. One of the dead included a neighbor who also heard the noise and decided to investigate, he said. Mr. Wambo called Buea ""paradise"" compared with what is happening in smaller villages. He says he has visited them to find rotting corpses and residents terrified that their young men will be mistaken for fighters and killed. Mr. Biya's government says the separatists are terrorists and has refused to open any dialogue with them. As for human rights abuses by government security forces, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, the communications minister, said that officials had been investigating the allegations they hear about. ""It is unacceptable to commit a crime and unlawful killing today, tomorrow or after tomorrow,"" he said. ""No army in the world is immune against misbehavior in a handful of its elements."" Separatists in some areas, including the English-speaking city of Bamenda, have blocked roads by felling trees and destroying bridges in an attempt to thwart soldiers from what is expected to be a major offensive. But the actions have also trapped civilians who are desperate to flee. Some others don't want to leave. One young man selling fruit on the streets of Buea this week said he knew his age alone made him a target. ""If I die, I want to die in my own home,"" he said. For those who have already escaped, their lives have been turned upside down. Many have crammed into homes, like the dank room with only one bed where a man named Justice ended up with his teenage niece and 2-year-old daughter. He ran away from Mile 16 after seeing the corpse of his neighbor, a farmer, caught in the crossfire between separatists and soldiers. Another man who fled to Yaoundé said he had endured a series of atrocities before finally giving up and packing his family of four into his brother's living room. Eleven people are now jammed into the small apartment, where he has hung a poster of numbers for his 4-year-old daughter. She has forgotten how to count to 10 after being out of school for so long. In Mile 16, schools have been closed for two years. The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted, said he had repeatedly run into roadblocks from separatists and shakedowns from soldiers who came to homes and helped themselves to laptops, televisions and cash. They even took soda without paying from a 12-year-old girl running a small store near his office, he said. ""We're working for you,"" he said they told her. It was a small thing, but he was outraged. Then he saw a body floating down a nearby stream, and that of a soldier at a traffic circle. But what finally pushed him to escape was the aftermath of gunfire as soldiers, shooting wildly, chased two men on motorcycles. One of the bullets entered his neighbor's living room window and struck and killed a teenage boy watching television. When asked if he was going to vote Sunday, the man's eyes widened. ""For what?"" he said. ""I've been voting for years and the results have never changed."""
News,2018-10-06,DUBLIN — Ireland will impose tobacco-style health warning labels on alcohol as part of a sweeping package of restrictions intended to tackle what a World Health Organization survey ranks as one of the world’s worst rates of binge drinking.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/world/europe/ireland-drinking-bill.html,898," DUBLIN — Ireland will impose tobacco-style health warning labels on alcohol as part of a sweeping package of restrictions intended to tackle what a World Health Organization survey ranks as one of the world's worst rates of binge drinking. A bill that passed the Irish Parliament's lower house on Wednesday limits alcohol advertising and requires that alcoholic products be separated from retail areas inside shops. It also demands health warnings, including about links to cancer, both on bottles and at the point of sale — even in shops and visitor centers attached to breweries and distilleries, which are major tourist attractions in a country famed for its exports of stout, cider and whiskey. The measure is the first in Ireland to treat excessive alcohol consumption as a health problem rather than as an issue of licensing or of law and order. It includes a minimum sales price per unit of alcohol and bans the advertising of alcohol in publicly owned parks and at sports events catering mainly to children. This year, Scotland became the first nation to introduce minimum alcohol unit prices, and many other countries restrict alcohol advertising and sponsorship to varying degrees. But Ireland's bill will be the first national law — unless successfully challenged in court — to require alcohol manufacturers to display warning labels about specific health risks. The labels must also specify for the first time the number of calories in a beverage, and the total alcohol content in grams as opposed to merely the percentage of alcohol. Patricia Callan, director of Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, an industry lobby group, said that it supported the objectives of the legislation but believed it was not evidence-based and would harm an important Irish industry. ""No other country in the world requires mandatory cancer warning labels,"" she said. ""And imposing such a label will cause substantial reputational damage to our quality products by applying a stigma to products made in Ireland."" Canada's Yukon Territory introduced a similar rule experimentally last year, but soon abandoned it under pressure from the drinks industry. The flip side of the alcohol industry's commercial and marketing success in Ireland, analysts say, is a culture that has traditionally tolerated, and sometimes even encouraged, heavy drinking. Ireland is second only to Austria in rates of binge drinking, with 39 percent of Irish people over 15 reporting heavy drinking in a one-month period, according to a 2014 survey by the World Health Organization. The country's Health Research Board estimated that in 2015 Irish people above the age of 15 consumed on average the equivalent of 41 liters of standard whiskey or vodka, or more than 116 bottles of wine, per head each year. The World Health Organization survey also found that Ireland ranked 12th in the world in terms of average alcohol consumption, while in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of developed economies, it ranked fourth, behind Estonia, Austria and France. Alcohol Action Ireland, a group of activists and health professionals that lobbied for the new law, says that alcohol causes, on average, three deaths every day in Ireland and is a factor in half of all suicides and a third of cases of deliberate self-harm. Excessive drinking disrupts families and communities, it says, and is also a factor in many assaults, rapes and murders, and in two-fifths of all traffic accidents in the country. While many Irish people are already aware of the social and health costs of alcohol consumption, the strong link between excessive alcohol use and several types of cancer has caught some by surprise. In the course of the debate, the opposition's health spokesman, Stephen Donnelly, reversed his party's earlier objection to the cancer labels, admitting that he had been shocked by research that showed 500 Irish people died of alcohol-related cancers each year, ""about three times the number of people who die on the roads,"" he said. The bill was fiercely resisted by a number of groups representing alcohol manufacturers, distributors and retailers. Parliamentary opposition and delays meant that almost three years have passed between the bill's initial introduction and its passage, which was greeted by applause in the Dail, the lower house of the Irish Parliament. Simon Harris, the health minister, joined his predecessors in championing the bill and said that he would like to examine further restrictions on alcohol advertising and sports sponsorship in the future. Ireland, despite being a small island nation of fewer than five million people, has experience in introducing groundbreaking health legislation. In 2004, Michael Martin, then the minister for health, stunned critics and tobacco industry lobbyists by passing the world's first law to ban smoking in the workplace — including in bars, restaurants and offices. In the years since the law's passage, much of the rest of the developed world has followed suit. Now that it has passed through the Dail, the bill on alcohol will go the Seanad, or senate, for further debate. The Seanad has limited powers to delay or amend the bill. The Irish government says, however, that the constitutionality of the law could yet be contested by the drinks lobby in court, or by other member states of the European Union. It could still be several years before warning labels appear on alcoholic beverages in Ireland, and even then there will be an exemption for alcohol bottled for export or for sale in duty-free shops."
News,2018-10-06,"SÃO PAULO, Brazil — There has been no lack of drama in the lead-up to Brazil’s presidential election on Sunday. One candidate was jailed, another was stabbed and a week before the voting, women organized nationwide protests against the front-runner.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/world/americas/brazil-president-election-jair-bolsonaro.html,820," SÃO PAULO, Brazil — There has been no lack of drama in the lead-up to Brazil's presidential election on Sunday. One candidate was jailed, another was stabbed and a week before the voting, women organized nationwide protests against the front-runner. The presidential contest, the most splintered and divisive race since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s, has for many Brazilians come down to who is the least bad option. The front-runner by a wide margin is the far-right former army captain, Jair Bolsonaro, according to the polls. A member of Congress since 1991, he was long a marginal figure best known for incendiary comments defending Brazil's military dictatorship and attacking women, gays and blacks. In addition to electing the next president from a field of 13 candidates, voters will also choose 27 governors and more than 1,600 state and federal lawmakers. In Brazil, there are 147.3 million eligible voters, and voting is obligatory. As anger and frustration with entrenched political corruption has grown, Mr. Bolsonaro has presented himself as an anti-establishment maverick who could effectively combat corruption and rein in soaring violence and crime. His main rival, former São Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, entered the race only last month. He was selected to represent the left-wing Workers' Party after the former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was sentenced to prison on corruption charges and barred from running as the party's candidate. Until the courts ruled him out, Mr. da Silva had been leading in the polls. But it appears that the Workers' Party has been unable to transfer Mr. da Silva's broad support among impoverished Brazilians to the less charismatic Mr. Haddad. The crowded field also includes Marina Silva, the daughter of Amazon rubber tappers; Geraldo Alckmin, the pragmatic and market-friendly former governor of São Paulo; and a candidate, Cabo Daciolo, who describes himself as a messenger from heaven. The final polls before Election Day showed Mr. Bolsonaro's lead widening as the evangelical and agribusiness lobbies rallied to his side. But he still appeared likely to fall short of the 50 percent-plus-one needed to avoid a runoff. Surveys project him competing in a second round of voting on Oct. 28 against Mr. Haddad. Still, some analysts think that Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, could defy the projections and emerge victorious on Sunday night despite — or perhaps because of — his lack of support from a major political party and a shoestring budget that relied on social media to build a base. Brazil uses an electronic ballot system and is expected to tally results within a couple of hours after polling stations close in the westernmost state of Acre at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Soaring crime, the worst recession on record and institutionalized political corruption have been the three main issues in the campaign. Despite accomplishing little of note during his seven terms as a lawmaker, Mr. Bolsonaro gained prominence when a massive corruption investigation known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash, engulfed all of Brazil's major political parties. He cultivated an image as an abrasive, but honest politician with a clean record. This was in contrast with the Workers' Party, which has been largely blamed for the vast bribery schemes of the past decade and a half. For many voters, the biggest concern has been violent crime. This past year, Brazil averaged 175 murders a day, surpassing its previous macabre record. Mr. Bolsonaro, who insists that he is the only candidate tough enough to stop criminals, has posed often for photos with his fingers pointed like loaded pistols. With his unfiltered comments and amateur videos on social media, he offered ready solutions for the country's problems: He wants to make it easier for citizens to own guns and for the police to shoot criminals. Critics worry, however, that Mr. Bolsonaro would undermine democratic institutions, and they point to outbursts like a congressional speech in 1993 when he declared, ""I am in favor of dictatorship."" As his standing in the polls has improved, opponents rallied behind the motto #EleNão, or #NotHim, taking to the streets and the internet to encourage voters to elect anyone but Mr. Bolsonaro. Brazil's sputtering economy has also divided voters. Many of the country's poorest people, who benefited from expanded social programs during Mr. da Silva's two terms as president, have embraced his stand-in, Mr. Haddad. The Workers' Party insisted that Mr. Haddad ""would make Brazil happy again."" But many other voters blame the Workers' Party for the deep recession that started on its watch. Every time the polls show Mr. Bolsonaro's popularity growing, the markets rally on the hope that he will curtail social spending and make fiscal changes. Mr. Bolsonaro's supporters also worry that a victory for Mr. Haddad would deal a blow to the Car Wash investigation, which might lead to Mr. da Silva being freed from prison, despite his corruption conviction."
News,2018-10-06,"NEW DELHI — Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India swept into office four years ago vowing to crush corruption. Some of his most momentous acts since taking office, like wiping out nearly 90 percent of India’s currency virtually overnight, have been to clean up the country’s endemic graft.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/world/asia/india-narendra-modi-bjp.html,1340," NEW DELHI — Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India swept into office four years ago vowing to crush corruption. Some of his most momentous acts since taking office, like wiping out nearly 90 percent of India's currency virtually overnight, have been to clean up the country's endemic graft. Mr. Modi was also quick to accuse the rival Congress Party, India's longstanding political dynasty, of lavish spending and crony capitalism. But in the past few weeks, the role of accuser has been dramatically reversed. The Congress Party, which had seemed anemic since Mr. Modi's election, has found a new spring in its step by hounding the prime minister over an opaque arms deal that has raised some serious questions. Why did Mr. Modi renegotiate a deal for 36 fighter jets? Why was a company run by members of one of India's wealthiest families chosen to participate in the deal, despite having no experience building jets? Why did the costs of the planes seem to jump so much? And why isn't Mr. Modi sharing more details? For several years, Indian politics have been dominated by Mr. Modi's party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., which has grown accustomed to pushing around its rivals. But for the first time in a long time, the opposition, by building a damaging narrative around this arms deal, has landed a solid punch, and is hoping to keep the pressure on Mr. Modi and his party ahead of next year's general election. Congress Party officials have dominated headlines and social media with their accusations that Mr. Modi inflated the price of the aircraft, estimated to cost $8.7 billion, and brought in a trusted ally on the deal so his political party could get something back in return. ""We smell something fishy,"" said Jaiveer Shergill, a Congress Party spokesman. The story of the jets starts in 2015, when Mr. Modi, on a visit to Paris, proudly announced that he had struck a deal with the French to buy three dozen supersonic Rafale fighter planes. The surprise wasn't the French partner, Dassault Aviation, maker of the storied Mirage. What raised eyebrows was a new twist in the deal announced more than a year later. The arrangement included what is called an offset contract in which the French, in return for selling India billions of dollars of planes, would invest in India and help Indian companies build aerospace components. The lead partner chosen for the offset contract was the Reliance Group, a conglomerate run by members of the Ambani family, one of India's richest and most ostentatious. While Reliance has long been involved in manufacturing and has billions of dollars in capital, it has no experience making jets. And the Ambanis are known to be strong Modi supporters. The former French president, François Hollande, added to the controversy surrounding the deal when he said recently that the Modi government had specifically proposed the Ambani-owned company for the offset contract. ""We did not have a say in this,"" Mr. Hollande, who was president at the time the deal was made, has been quoted as saying by Mediapart, a French news outlet. ""We did not have a choice."" Mukesh Ambani, the billionaire who built a 27-story house that overlooks slums, is considered one of Mr. Modi's closest corporate allies. His younger brother, Anil, runs the Reliance Group, a separate operation from Mukesh's holdings. Some of the Reliance Group's business units are struggling, and it recently sold a number of assets to lower its debt load. Anil has also heaped praise on Mr. Modi, calling him ""a king among kings"" and likening him to one of the greatest heroes of Hindu mythology. Though most pundits believe next year's national elections are still Mr. Modi's to lose, the contest appears to be tightening. More and more Indians are frustrated with the economy, inflation and Mr. Modi's lofty but unfulfilled promises to create enough jobs. So opposition politicians have seized on this jet deal with an almost desperate glee. Reliance will make an ""unwarranted, escalated profit,'' said Mr. Shergill, the Congress Party spokesman. ""How much of a share is the B.J.P. getting out of that profit?"" Rahul Gandhi, the Congress Party leader, put it even more bluntly. On Twitter, he called Mr. Modi the ""commander in thief."" With these accusations swirling around him, Mr. Modi has gone with his usual response: silence. Rather than speaking out himself, he has deputized party officials and ministers to fend off claims of a quid pro quo between the governing party and Reliance Group. His stand-ins have argued that the details of the agreement, including how the price was set and why Reliance was selected, cannot be revealed because of the contract's ""secrecy clause."" Analysts say the strategy isn't working. ""This is a persistent problem with this government,"" said Milan Vaishnav, the director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""You have no clear spokesperson with the prime minister's office, you have no media adviser. I think on many of these issues they often come across as flat-footed or disorganized."" Until the backlash over the jet deal, Mr. Modi had seemed to float above the most serious allegations against his administration or political party. A shrewd steward of his image, he would draw on his personal story of being the son of a tea seller, a devout Hindu and a prime minister who lives simply. He has often boasted that his government was clean and that he was a cut above previous prime ministers tainted by corruption. One was Rajiv Gandhi, Rahul's father, who was suspected of taking millions of dollars in kickbacks in the 1980s from another opaque arms deal, although an Indian court officially cleared him in 2004, 13 years after his assassination. Now, Mr. Vaishnav said, the opposition can say about Mr. Modi: ""You're just like anybody else."" India's Ministry of Defense denied any wrongdoing in the deal, calling the offset contract ""a purely commercial arrangement between two private companies."" An official with Dassault Aviation said in an email that the company chose ""our partners freely without pressure from the Indian government."" Supporters of Mr. Modi argue that the Reliance Group, a conglomerate with thousands of employees and experience working on big infrastructure projects, isn't such an odd choice as a partner to the deal. A Reliance spokesperson said that other Indian companies with little track record in defense manufacturing had also jumped into the sector and that this controversy was a ""nonissue"" stirred up by corporate rivalries. India's original plan was to buy 126 Rafale jets, with a large portion of them built in India, for less than $100 million per jet, according to figures provided by Congress Party officials, whose leaders negotiated the first rounds of the deal when they were in power several years ago. At that time, the leading contender on the India side was Hindustan Aeronautics, a government-owned company with a history of making military aircraft, though its record on deliveries was mediocre. Under the terms of the deal negotiated by Mr. Modi, the price-per-plane rose enormously, Mr. Gandhi contends, to over $230 million each. That figure has been contested by defenders of the deal, who say its total price also includes missiles, spare parts and other costs — more than just the planes themselves, which they say individually cost a little more than $100 million each. One point on which there is widespread agreement: India's need to update its aging fighter jets. India aspires to be able to wage a two-front war, but analysts say its current air force would be annihilated by a simultaneous attack from China and Pakistan, India's regional rivals. While voters may find the murky affair hard to follow, the opposition is likely to do all it can to make sure people don't forget. ""This is all about optics,"" said Harsh V. Pant, an international relations professor at King's College in London. ""It's not about bringing anyone to justice or doing anything for the greater good,'' he added. ""It's all about the 2019 election."""
News,2018-10-07,HONG KONG — China is signaling that it is worried about its economy.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/business/china-lending-trade-war.html,1071," HONG KONG — China is signaling that it is worried about its economy. Troubled by slowing growth, persistent debt problems and President Trump's trade war, the Chinese government has taken steps in recent months to shore up its economy. It has pared back a high-profile campaign to tackle debt. It has restarted big infrastructure projects, a traditional economic engine. It has even censored bad economic news. On Sunday, Beijing went one step further. The People's Bank of China, the central bank, pulled a financial lever that will effectively pump $175 billion into the economy. The government is aiming to help small and midsize businesses in particular, which have had trouble obtaining loans and face other rising pressures. The move signals that China's economy ""is really not doing well,"" Chen Shouhong, the founder of the investment information platform Gelonghui, wrote on WeChat, a popular Chinese social media service. The growing trade war with the United States has been the most visible threat. In September, the United States imposed tariffs on $200 billion in goods from China. President Trump has shown little inclination to back off and relations between the two countries have cooled, suggesting the trade war could worsen before it gets better. So far, the trade war has had only a minor impact on China's $12 trillion economy. Trade isn't as important to China as it once was, thanks in part to the rise of a middle class that has been a ready buyer of Chinese goods at home. Still, tariffs could hurt the economy the longer they last. In September, new export orders — one indicator of China's manufacturing — fell to the lowest level since 2016. But China has bigger problems than the trade war. Consumers are spending less. Retail sales this year have grown at the slowest rate in a decade. Wage growth is plodding. Infrastructure investment — a pillar of the Chinese economy — slowed significantly in the first half of the year. The pace at which companies are defaulting on their bonds has quickened. China also has to contend with a stock market that has fallen by around 15 percent this year and a currency that has lost 10 percent of its value against the dollar. Some Chinese entrepreneurs also say the business environment is souring. The government could soon require companies to pay more in taxes and benefits. Government officials in recent months have scurried to counter the broader economic slowdown. They pledged to pump billions of dollars into infrastructure projects, shored up the value of the currency and moved to backstop the falling stock market. China has used these methods for years to spur growth, but they represent a retreat from more recent government efforts to pare back debt. China unleashed a wave of spending and lending beginning a decade ago that rescued its economy from the global economic downturn but left many of its companies and local governments heavily burdened with debt. Economists have warned that China must address its debt problems if it hopes to keep its economy humming. Beijing appeared to be listening. Earlier this year Liu He, a trusted economic adviser to Xi Jinping, the country's top leader, promised to rein in China's debt over the next three years. Mr. Liu's appointment in March as vice premier overseeing financial and industrial policy was seen as a commitment by Chinese officials to crack down on lending. Now, Beijing has changed its tune. In August, the People's Bank of China said it would ensure that money flowed from its state-controlled banking sector to companies that needed it, in particular exporters and small and medium enterprises. The National Development and Reform Commission also flagged concerns about the financing difficulties of private companies in June. The government has promoted rail and other infrastructure projects that were previously stalled or blocked because of concerns about ballooning debt. If it wasn't clear before last week that Chinese officials were concerned about a slowing economy, a move by the government on Sept. 28 to censor negative economic news made it clear. Among the items on a list of forbidden topics on a government directive sent to journalists in China were any economic data that showed a slowing economy, local government debt and risks, and signs of declining consumer confidence. On Sunday, the People's Bank of China said that it would cut the amount of money that some lenders are required to hold in reserve — called the reserve ratio — by one percentage point. The move essentially frees up more money for China's state-controlled banks to lend out. About $65.5 billion of that cash injection will be directed to banks to repay debts that are due in coming weeks, while the rest will be pushed into the financial market. The central bank made the move to ensure ""reasonable and sufficient liquidity"" in China's economy, it said. This is the fourth time this year that the central bank has cut the reserve ratio. But this time, the reserve ratio cut, which is set to go into effect on Oct. 15, was unusually big and broad. While the central bank cut the reserve ratio by a similar amount earlier this year, it put more conditions on how banks could use the extra money. The bank has shied away from making such stark moves in recent years, as it has found more subtle ways to adjust the amount of money in China's financial system depending on its needs. The announcement on Sunday suggests the central bank felt it had to do more than that. The size and breadth of the move, wrote Mr. Chen, the Gelonghui founder, shows ""there are fewer and fewer tools in the P.B.O.C. toolbox."" The move was in direct response to the slowing growth, Zhang Ming, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said on Sunday. Mr. Zhang predicted that China's third-quarter gross domestic product would drop to 6.6 percent growth compared with 6.8 percent a year ago and that its fourth-quarter figure could be as low as 6.4 percent. China posted economic growth of 6.7 percent in the quarter that ended in June, though China's official figures are widely doubted. ""Sino-U.S. trade frictions will further reduce the contribution of imports and exports to economy growth,"" Mr. Zhang, who is also chief economist at Ping An Securities, wrote on WeChat. ""If export growth slows down due to trade frictions, it will influence manufacturing investment growth,"" he added."

A huge Republican victory. At a cost. Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in to a lifetime appointment as a justice of the Supreme Court after being confirmed by a 50-48 vote in the Senate on Saturday. His arrival swings the court to the right for what could be a generation. Above, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, after the vote. The partisan fight over his confirmation triggered #MeToo fury and rage at white male entitlement, and President Trump encouraged a sharp backlash. The battle has left the Senate and the country bruised, divided and raw, and the Supreme Court tarnished. (The court hears arguments on Tuesday.) Democratic anger may move Congress to the left in midterm elections, just four weeks away, that will determine Mr. Trump's prospects for the last two years of his term. House Democrats have already promised to investigate the accusations of sexual misconduct and perjury against Judge Kavanaugh should they retake the chamber. Here is our reconstruction of the most dramatic confirmation fight in a quarter-century. ____ 2. Adding to President Trump's victories, he fulfilled a campaign promise by renegotiating Nafta — at the expense of relations with Canada. Under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, rules will change on dairy exports, intellectual property and car manufacturing. Above, Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, met with autoworkers on Friday. And the American economy is humming. The Labor Department reported that unemployment fell to 3.7 percent in September, the lowest rate in nearly 50 years. Here's the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles. (Our news quiz is off for a couple of weeks, while our writer takes a break.) _____ 3. President Trump has long claimed to be a self-made billionaire. But he received at least $413 million in today's dollars from his father, Fred Trump, pictured above. An investigation by The Times found that much of that reached Mr. Trump because he helped his parents dodge taxes, with sham corporations, improper deductions and real estate holdings undervalued by hundreds of millions. The schemes — some of them outright fraud — enabled the family to evade hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes on the transfer of over $1 billion to the Trump children. Here are 11 takeaways from our report. A lawyer for the president said ""there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone,"" and Mr. Trump called the article an ""old, boring and often told hit piece."" But officials in New York State and New York City are investigating. Meanwhile, the first lady, Melania Trump, is returning to the U.S. after a week far from the bedlam of Washington. She seemed at ease on visits to Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt. She did raise eyebrows by wearing a white pith helmet, a symbol of colonial rule. Follow her trip in photos. ____ 4. The Nobel Peace Prize went to Dr. Denis Mukwege, a Congolese gynecological surgeon, and Nadia Murad, a Yazidi woman who was forced into sexual slavery by the Islamic State, for their campaigns to end the use of mass rape as a weapon of war. Ms. Murad, 25, has become the voice of women who survived sexual violence by ISIS. Dr. Mukwege, 63, has treated thousands of women in a country once called the rape capital of the world. Speculation on possible winners had included prime movers in encouraging North Korea to denuclearize. That process took another step today. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has met the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and then the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in. Mr. Moon's office said that a second U.S.-North Korean summit meeting had been agreed on. ____ 5. The death toll from an earthquake and 20-foot tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Sept. 28 increased to more than 1,700. Many more are believed to have died, been buried under soil, swept away by waves or trapped in a tangle of crushed buildings that will take months, possibly years, to clear. ""They are finding devastation and tragedy everywhere,"" a spokeswoman for one aid group said. Liquefaction — when an earthquake turns land into roiling waves like liquid — obliterated whole villages and neighborhoods. ____ 6. A breaking story: A collision between a limousine carrying a wedding party and another vehicle left 20 people dead on Saturday in upstate New York. Here's what we have so far. A team from the National Transportation Safety Board is en route. _____ 7. ""Justice for Laquan!""  Crowds outside a Chicago courthouse, above, had prepared to protest, but instead they cheered as Officer Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder for shooting Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, 16 times in 2014. It was the first conviction of a Chicago police officer for an on-duty shooting in nearly 50 years. Whether it will ease decades of mistrust and anger between the police and black Chicagoans remains to be seen. Nationally, in 15 prominent cases of black people killed in confrontations with the police since 2014, three officers have now been convicted. ____ 8. ""We've been Banksy-ed."" The street artist appeared to pull off one of his greatest pranks. His work ""Girl With Balloon"" sold for $1.4 million before being shredded by a rigged frame at Sotheby's auction house in London on Friday. Separately, don't miss the Magazine's culture issue this week, featuring stories about ""The Good Place,"" the director Barry Jenkins (""Moonlight,"" ""If Beale Street Could Talk"") and a profile of Lady Gaga, the titled nova in Bradley Cooper's ""A Star is Born."" ____ 9. Yankees 6, Red Sox 2  With two homers from Gary Sanchez and one from Aaron Judge, the Yankees won in Fenway Park to head home with the American League division series tied at 1-1. They play again on Monday in New York, where the Yankees have won seven consecutive playoff games dating to last season. The Houston Astros will face the Indians in Cleveland on Monday. In the National League, the Milwaukee Brewers take on the Colorado Rockies today (4:30 p.m. Eastern), and the Los Angeles Dodgers face the Atlanta Braves (8 p.m. Eastern). ____ 10. There were no surprise celebrity guests on ""Saturday Night Live,"" so the show's ensemble cast was on its own to address Brett Kavanaugh's contentious confirmation to the Supreme Court. The cold open: a celebratory Republican locker room, with Senators Mitch McConnell (Beck Bennett) and Jeff Flake (Pete Davidson), above. The show's host was the comic actress Awkwafina (""Ocean's 8,"" ""Crazy Rich Asians""), who thanked another Asian woman who has hosted the show, her idol Lucy Liu, for ""opening the door."" _____ 11.

The detention of Mr. Meng, 64, is an audacious step by the party, even by the standards of the increasingly authoritarian system under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. China has sought legitimacy and a leadership role in international organizations, and Mr. Meng's appointment in November 2016 as the president of Interpol, the first Chinese head of the global policing agency, was seen by many as a significant step in that direction. His detention undermines that campaign. Mr. Meng's appointment ""was considered quite an achievement for China and a sign of its international presence and growing influence,"" said Julian Ku, a professor at Hofstra University's Maurice A. Deane School of Law, who has studied China's relationship with international law. While China may have had its eye on placing its citizens in other top posts at prominent global organizations, ""the fact that Meng was 'disappeared' without any notice to Interpol will undermine this Chinese global outreach effort,"" Mr. Ku said. ""It is hard to imagine another international organization feeling comfortable placing a Chinese national in charge without feeling nervous that this might happen."" The announcement of Mr. Meng's detention came hours after his wife, Grace, told reporters in Lyon, France, that before her husband had vanished on a trip to China, he had sent her a phone message with an emoji of a knife. She interpreted the knife image to mean ""he is in danger,"" she said in a brief statement to reporters on Sunday in Lyon, where the two were living and where Interpol is headquartered. Ms. Meng gave her statement at a hotel, keeping her back to reporters so that her face would not be captured on camera, a precaution that she said was for security reasons for herself and her children. She said she had received the message with the knife image shortly after Mr. Meng arrived in China. It came just four minutes after she received a message from him saying, ""Wait for my call,"" she said. She has not heard from him since. She reported his disappearance to the French police on Oct. 4. A French police investigation is now underway, with the authorities saying that he had boarded a plane and arrived in China, but that his subsequent whereabouts was unknown. In addition to serving as president of the international crime-fighting body, Mr. Meng is also a vice minister in the Chinese Ministry of Public Security. The central commission can detain party officials for months or years while carrying out an investigation. The commission often concludes an investigation by stripping an official of party membership, stating the official's violations of party regulations and referring the official to the justice system for criminal prosecution. Since Mr. Xi took power as president of China, the commission has gone on a wide-ranging anticorruption campaign that has touched every level of the party. His detention means that internal party dynamics supersede any concern from the party about international legitimacy or transparency. The party's moves in this case ""suggest that the domestic considerations outweighed the international ones,"" said Mr. Ku, the law professor. ""This has always been true for China, but perhaps not so obviously true as in this case."" It is unclear what led to Mr. Meng's apparent downfall — a power struggle within the party or an actual case of corruption that officials deemed to be beyond the pale. There have been investigations of prominent figures in the anticorruption campaign. The most notable has been that of Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the elite Politburo Standing Committee and top security official. Many analysts of Chinese politics say Mr. Xi viewed Mr. Zhou as a rival and used the anticorruption campaign to imprison him. ""What I find most interesting about Meng Hongwei's detention,"" said Elizabeth Economy, director of Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, ""is the continued parade of senior officials being arrested."" With officials appointed by Mr. Xi himself now being caught up in the six-year anticorruption drive, ""it raises the question of whether Xi Jinping simply has a very thin bench of clean officials from whom to choose, whether these officials were adequately vetted before being promoted or whether the anticorruption campaign is simply failing to deter officials from continued corrupt behaviors,"" Ms. Economy said. ""Whatever the reason, it doesn't bode well for the party's ability, ultimately, to police itself."" Margaret Lewis, a professor of Chinese and Taiwanese law at Seton Hall University Law School, said Mr. Meng's detention sends a signal that ""no one is safe,"" and it could give other Chinese officials posted abroad ""pause when considering their own travel plans."" Mr. Meng was last seen leaving Interpol headquarters in Lyon on Sept. 29 for his trip to China. His wife and children had moved with him to Lyon after his appointment. Under the terms of Interpol's Constitution, the acting senior vice president, Kim Jong-yang of South Korea, becomes acting president. At her news conference on Sunday, Ms. Meng said she had decided to speak publicly because she felt it was her responsibility to do so. Her step was extraordinary: Family members of Chinese officials in trouble with the party or government usually do not make a plea for international help. ""From now on, I have gone from sorrow and fear to the pursuit of truth, justice and responsibility toward history,"" she said. ""For the husband whom I deeply love, for my young children, for the people of my motherland, for all the wives and children, so that their husbands and fathers will no longer disappear."""

In recent years, the Nobel committee has tended to honor economists who focus on the mechanics of individual behavior, rather than the authors of grand macroeconomic theories. Last year's winner was the behavioral economist Richard Thaler, who was recognized for his work demonstrating that people are predictably irrational — that human behavior defies economic theory in ways that are both consistent and foreseeable. — Binyamin Appelbaum TECHNOLOGY Google continues its uphill battle in the consumer hardware business. The company on Tuesday is expected to unveil an array of products, including its third-generation Pixel smartphones, at an event in New York. Though the Pixel phones have received glowing reviews, they are still small sellers compared with Apple iPhones and Samsung devices. — Brian X. Chen ECONOMY On Thursday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will announce its reading of the Consumer Price Index for September. Inflation has been tame lately, despite a strong economy, and the C.P.I. is expected to reflect that. The overall index and the core components are both expected to rise 0.2 percent. On the other hand, a stronger-than-expected figure could unnerve investors already concerned about rising interest rates. — Nelson D. Schwartz ECONOMY The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund gather for their annual meetings this week on the Indonesian island of Bali. The gatherings come as politicians in countries like the United States have rebuked multilateralism and openly questioned the value of international institutions like the World Bank and I.M.F. Officials gathered in Bali will probably address the rising tensions between the United States and China. Christine Lagarde, the head of the I.M.F., is expected to address how trade can be an engine of growth for all nations. Also on the agenda: how the global economy is at risk of another economic crisis, something that the I.M.F. warned about in its recent Global Financial Stability Report.  — Alexandra Stevenson BANKING  Bank earnings season begins this week with the first three megabanks revealing their third-quarter results on Friday. Reports are due from JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup before the stock market opens. Investors will be looking at their loan growth, which could be stronger than it was in last year's third quarter thanks to a better overall economy. Their trading businesses may have suffered again. — Emily Flitter"
News,2018-10-07,"When Charles Myers, the chairman of a financial advisory firm, hosted four relatively unknown Democratic congressional candidates at his Midtown Manhattan home last month, he netted more money than he can remember collecting from an event that wasn’t headlined by a presidential candidate.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/us/politics/wall-street-election-donations.html,1726," When Charles Myers, the chairman of a financial advisory firm, hosted four relatively unknown Democratic congressional candidates at his Midtown Manhattan home last month, he netted more money than he can remember collecting from an event that wasn't headlined by a presidential candidate. ""More than ever in my 26-year career on Wall Street, donors are willing to look way beyond concerns of overregulation from Democrats,"" said Mr. Myers, a longtime Democratic fund-raiser. They just want to elect ""Democrats to serve as a check"" on President Trump. The stock market may be booming. Unemployment is hitting record lows. Republicans pushed through $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. But despite all that, for the first time in a decade, the broader financial community is on pace to give more money to Democratic congressional candidates and incumbents than their Republican counterparts, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign donations. Some of the same grass-roots energy coursing through the Democratic Party — House candidates from Kentucky to Montana to New York are reporting record sums of small donations — has spilled into the corporate boardrooms of American finance, even amid increasingly hostile rhetoric from Democrats in Washington and on the campaign trail toward Wall Street. ""When one party controls all the levers, it is a lot easier for the opposing party to motivate donors,"" said Marc Short, the former Trump White House director of legislative affairs, who has deep relationships in the donor world. ""It's both money and activism. But obviously much of the money comes from Wall Street."" In interviews with two dozen Wall Street executives, fund-raisers, donors and those who raise money from them, Democrats described an extraordinary level of investment and excitement from the finance sector. And many Republicans fretted about a softening of donor enthusiasm — Mr. Short warned of ""complacency"" — in what has long been one of the party's most critical and reliable sources of campaign cash. The numbers are stark. Four years ago, in the last congressional midterm, Republican incumbents and candidates outraised Democratic counterparts by more than $50 million in direct donations from the broader finance, insurance and real estate industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. And in 2016 and 2012, Republicans outraised Democrats from that group by nearly $50 million and $100 million respectively, the data show. This year, Democrats held a narrow $5 million advantage through the middle of the year. That figure will shift, possibly substantially, when candidates reveal their latest fund-raising hauls later this month. But Democrats have already surpassed their 2012 and 2014 totals, and most Republicans with ties to Wall Street described a grim political outlook, even as the confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court brought renewed energy nationally to their party. ""You've got a midterm election coming up that looks right now fairly bleak for the Republicans,"" said Stephen Moore, the conservative economist who founded the Club for Growth and maintains close ties to Wall Street donors. ""Wall Street is — and corporate America is — pretty famous for hedging their bets,"" Mr. Moore said. ""They just want to follow winners. They just want to make sure they have access to the people who win. This is no exception."" Some Republicans, including Mr. Moore, cited residual anger from the tax-cut bill, which eliminated a key deduction for state and local taxes in blue states such as New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where most of Wall Street's big earners live. Others pointed to Mr. Trump's personality and his social and cultural agenda that has proved divisive, especially among college-educated voters. ""A lot of Mitt Romney donors are doing nothing,"" said one New York financial executive and Republican fund-raiser, who, like many, spoke on condition of anonymity to maintain relationships with contributors. ""A lot of these guys just completely disappeared."" Hey, I'm Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I'll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.  Many midlevel donors seem to be simply sitting out this cycle, according to Republican officials; some big contributors have been slower or more reluctant to give ahead of expected losses. From donors in just the securities and investment sector, Democratic congressional incumbents and candidates have so far received $39.3 million in 2018, compared with $28 million for Republicans. That is a reversal from 2014, when Democrats raised $28 million and Republicans $41.5 million. In 2018, 15 of the top 20 congressional recipients of securities and investment industry cash are Democrats; in 2014, 15 of the top 20 were Republicans. The totals do not include independent super PAC giving, and the next round of disclosures, which will run through the end of September, will be released later this month. Despite the balance sheet shifting to the left, Wall Street remains a wellspring of financial support for Republicans. Political action committee money from Wall Street, which makes up about a third of total giving so far, still tilts Republican. And Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity Blackstone Group and an adviser to Mr. Trump, for instance, has already donated $7.25 million to super PACs benefiting House and Senate Republicans. In September, Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, spoke to a gathering of top Republican Party donors in Manhattan that included some of the billionaire titans of Wall Street. Among them: Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade; Daniel S. Loeb, the hedge fund manager of Third Point L.L.C.; Charles R. Schwab, the founder of Charles Schwab Corporation; and Paul Singer, the hedge fund magnate who runs Elliott Management Corporation. And this month, Speaker Paul Ryan is scheduled to brief a small group of top New York-area donors at the office of Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of American International Group, according to an invitation obtained by The New York Times. But some of the industry's prominent Republican donors have flipped parties entirely, most notably Seth Klarman, a hedge fund manager and former top Republican contributor, who is now pledging to give as much as $20 million to help Democrats in 2018. Finn Wentworth, the founder of a real estate investment firm and the former chief operating officer of the holding company that owns the New York Yankees, was a fund-raiser for the Republican National Committee as recently as 2016. But he said he has found Mr. Trump's ""lack of empathy for others"" to be ""distressing"" and said he has raised hundreds of thousands for Mikie Sherrill, a Democratic House candidate and Navy veteran in northern New Jersey, who has excited many donors. Mr. Wentworth questioned the deductions provision of the tax bill, among other policies pursued by a Republican-controlled Washington. ""It was almost like the New York metropolitan area — we had a target on our back,"" he said. This year, Democrats in New York and on Wall Street have organized a new effort, called the House Victory Project, where ""partners"" are asked to contribute more than $100,000 to be divided among key battleground House races; three people familiar with the effort said the group has raised more than $10 million. Congressional candidates blessed by the effort are in line to receive as much as $500,000 each. Giving to once-obscure House candidates is suddenly in vogue, with Democratic donors saying it has never-seen-before cachet in finance circles. ""What I have never seen in my lifetime is the level of energy for all these local races,"" said Orin Kramer, a veteran Democratic fund-raiser and founder of a hedge fund. ""I've never seen such an appetite for candidates who people have never heard of."" ""It's not a matter of degree,"" added Mr. Kramer, who has contributed to the House Victory Project and hosted events of his own. ""It's a phenomenon that hasn't existed before."" Democrats have cut into the Republicans' financial edge even as Republicans are still receiving 60 percent of the political action committee cash from the broader financial sector, roughly the same share as past cycles. That means that the industry's formal lobbying and political arms are still donating to Republicans, while employees and executives are increasingly giving to Democrats. This year, the American Bankers Association is buying television ads for lawmakers for the first time in its history, supporting eight Republicans and four Democrats. Rob Nichols, the association's president, called the campaign ""rigorously bipartisan,"" though all eight Republicans are in contested races, while only one of the Democrats, Senator Jon Tester of Montana, is. Of course, in the age of super PACs, billionaire donors can still have an outsize impact with a single check. And Mr. Trump can conceivably make up any missing donors on Wall Street with financial support elsewhere, just as he drove different voters to the polls in 2016 as some traditional Republicans stayed home. The single biggest donor of the cycle is the former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who made his multibillion-dollar fortune selling computer terminals to Wall Street. He has pledged $100 million for the Democrats. The largest Republican contributor is the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. He and his wife have contributed $55 million to Republican super PACs. To rally Wall Street support, Republican leaders have been sounding the alarm not just about the broader threat of a Nancy Pelosi-led House, but specifically about who is in line to chair the powerful Financial Services Committee: Representative Maxine Waters of California, a liberal firebrand whom Mr. Trump has also taken to attacking by name. ""Finance people — when they find out that Maxine Waters is going to be in charge of finance — they panic,"" said John Catsimatidis, a billionaire Trump donor in New York, who was one of the few who said he said he saw no softening among Republican donor interest on Wall Street. Last month, when Mr. Ryan briefed members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce about the stakes of the election and the regulations that Democratic control could unleash, he name-checked potential Democratic committee chairs, including Ms. Waters, according to two attendees. For Democrats, Mr. Trump himself has proved a unifying message when seeking out financial industry contributors. ""You would expect, with the economy doing as well as it is today, that there would be a desire to keep the status quo,"" said Thomas R. Nides, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton now working on Wall Street. But he said, ""I don't think people care. They're worried about the direction of the country."""

A deepening U.S. divide, Chinese crackdown's surprise target, Banksy's expensive prank. Here's what you need to know: • Remaking the U.S. Supreme Court, at a cost. Against the backdrop of bitter protests, Judge Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the country's highest court by one of the slimmest margins in history, putting the last of three branches of the U.S. government under conservative control. The partisan battle over his elevation widened as accusations of sexual misconduct tapped fury over #MeToo and white privilege, a conflagration that deeply eroded the court's apolitical image. Next: Will Democratic rage dominate congressional midterms, just a month away? We have a guide with everything you need to know about the elections. And our newsletter Abroad in America helps make sense of what's going on in Washington. _____ • Even Interpol is no shield from China.  Meng Hongwei, the Interpol president who was reported missing after leaving France for China, is being investigated for ""violating the law,"" the country's anti-corruption watchdog said. Hours later, Interpol announced that Mr. Meng, above, had resigned. What he did is not clear, but this is: Global prominence will not stay Beijing's hand. Across the border, Hong Kong declined to renew the visa of the Financial Times Asia news editor, Victor Mallet, which will lead to his expulsion. The move came after Mr. Mallet drew the ire of Chinese officials by hosting, as vice president of the Foreign Correspondents' Club, a talk with the pro-independence advocate Andy Chan. While Beijing has denied visas for foreign journalists, this is the first time Hong Kong has done so. Human rights activists warned of a deterioration of free speech and China's increased interference in the semiautonomous city. _____ • The perils for Afghan women. This weekend was 17 years since the U.S. went to war in Afghanistan. The conflict's efficacy and lasting impact provides plenty of debate fodder in the West. In Afghanistan, dozens of people were killed just in the last 24 hours, underscoring the war's grinding toll. The country is also still wrestling with complex security and cultural questions. One example: Evidence shows that when women are involved in the security sector, nations enjoy a more stable, lasting peace. But only about 1.4 percent of Afghan security forces are women, pictured above. They are widely frowned upon, even referred to as ""whores."" And predators find many ways of stalking women. Because infertility is often blamed on them, a con man found his opening — going around the country for years claiming he could ""cure"" them with sex. He filmed the encounters and then blackmailed the women. He is now on the run — and the women suspected of having fallen for his scheme are turning up dead. _____ • A pastor in Australia faces drought. ""We pray for your mercy in sending soaking rain that really replenishes the land and restores the country."" So prays the Rev. Bernard Gabbott, above, who came to the small town of Wee Waa a decade ago to bring people to Jesus. Today, as the worst drought in decades continues to wither a vast tract of rural Australia, he has become a counselor, a social worker and a philanthropist — facing changing weather and trying to keep one community from falling apart. _____ _____ • China's agricultural industry is undergoing a monumental shift. Small family farms are leasing their lands for others to work, planting the seeds for bigger commercial farms that could boost the economy. • China's central bank is cutting the amount that some lenders must hold in reserve, effectively pumping $174 billion into the economy. The move signals worries about slowing growth and increased pressures from the trade war with the U.S. • Asia's high demand for sea cucumbers has turned the unglamorous creatures into ""black gold"" for fishers, endangering the species and threatening to disrupt underwater ecosystems. • ""Venom,"" starring Tom Hardy as a fanged antihero, and the bittersweet romance ""A Star Is Born,"" this time with Lady Gaga in the lead role, vastly exceeded expectations, sending the North American box office to an October record. • Coming this week: Google's new products, the Nobel Prize in Economics and bank earnings will all be announced over the next few days. • Here's a snapshot of global markets.

It told a loose story about ""Jellicle"" cats gathered for a junkyard ball. The New York show received mixed reviews (""Whatever the other failings and excesses, even banalities, of 'Cats,'"" Frank Rich wrote in The Times, ""it believes in purely theatrical magic"").

In December 2019, ""Cats"" makes its movie debut, with Steven Spielberg and Mr. Lloyd Webber executive producing. Shooting starts in Britain next month; James Corden, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen and Taylor Swift are among those slated to prowl the screen. ""I think the key to the 'Cats' movie is going to be: What do they look like?"" Mr. Lloyd Webber said last year. ""I think that you can't do 'Cats' with a great deal of C.G.I.,"" he added.

News,2018-10-07,"Qualcomm, the American chip maker, spent two years hammering out a $44 billion deal to acquire a Dutch semiconductor manufacturer. Then, as the trade war with the United States erupted, Chinese regulators effectively killed it.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/business/china-trade-deals-retaliate.html,1047," Qualcomm, the American chip maker, spent two years hammering out a $44 billion deal to acquire a Dutch semiconductor manufacturer. Then, as the trade war with the United States erupted, Chinese regulators effectively killed it. Now China is looking for new ways to retaliate in the intensifying trade drama — and experts warn that some corporate deals with American buyers could be in jeopardy. A number of global deals involving American companies are under review by Chinese market regulators. Among the biggest is Walt Disney Company's $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox, which has an Oct. 19 deadline. United Technologies — owner of Pratt & Whitney, the jet engine maker, and other industrial businesses — is waiting to close a $30 billion purchase of Rockwell Collins, the aerospace parts maker. China's antitrust regulators disclose little about their deliberations. But some companies worry that this opacity could provide cover for retaliation in response to tariffs that the United States has placed on Chinese goods — and wonder if long-negotiated deals could become collateral damage in the trade war. ""Given the level of trade tensions now, in some exceptional cases you cannot exclude the possibility that individual transactions may be implicated,"" said Fay Zhou, a partner at the law firm Linklaters in Beijing. Officials at China's antimonopoly agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation, did not respond to requests for comment. American companies have prospered by exploring new markets and taking risks to extend their global reach. But President Trump warned last week that these were early days in his trade strategy — ""China wants to talk, very badly, and I said, 'Frankly, it's too early to talk' "" — and American companies may encounter some backlash from Beijing. China is looking for ways to retaliate because it has more or less run out of American imports to tax. China matched Mr. Trump's initial tariffs on about $50 billion in Chinese goods, but last month he placed a 10 percent tax on $200 billion of Chinese goods. China doesn't import enough from the United States to match that dollar for dollar. So China has only so many avenues to inflict pain. They could include slow inspections for imports at Chinese ports and tighter regulatory scrutiny of American companies doing business in China. Deals are a ripe area, too. ""This is a way for China to put pressure on American corporations to get them to work on the U.S. government,"" said Chen Zhiwu, a professor of finance and the director of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong. Blocking American deals comes with some cost. Aggressive regulators could spur foreign companies to retreat from China just when economic growth there is slowing. ""China has valid reasons to be angry with the Trump administration's protectionist tariffs,"" said Fred Hu, the chairman of Primavera Capital Group and a former chairman of Goldman Sachs for China. But, he added, ""it is unlikely to direct its anger at American businesses."" ""On the contrary, China is trying to cultivate ties with them,"" Mr. Hu said. Regulators in China have a wide scope for denying deals by American buyers, even if Chinese companies aren't involved. Chinese officials can block a deal for any new venture that they deem would have too much market control in China. The country's broadly defined antimonopoly law allows regulators to consider more than what an individual deal might cost consumers or a specific Chinese business. ""Authorities are obliged to consider not just the competition merits of a deal but also the impact of a deal on China's national economy,"" said Ms. Zhou, a former official at the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, which until recently was in charge of greenlighting deals. China's approach has been reciprocated, to a point. American regulators have taken a tighter stance on international deals that they believe could benefit China or its companies. In August, Congress strengthened the ability of the government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to block foreign deals. United Technologies said it was still on track with regulatory approvals needed for its Rockwell Collins deal. But when asked on a conference call in June whether the trade war could prevent the deal from going through, Akhil Johri, United Technology's chief financial officer said, ""That is something you always have to think about or worry about."" Last Monday, United Technologies received a green light from regulators in the United States. ""The process for closing on Rockwell Collins is moving forward with the recent U.S. Department of Justice approval being the latest milestone,"" said Michele Quintaglie, a spokeswoman for United Technologies. China's approval is the last step. Fox and Disney executives have said in private discussions that they expect their deal to be cleared without any problems. In a regulatory filing from June, Disney listed Chinese approval as a potential hurdle that the deal would have to overcome. Some large deals have cleared Chinese regulators despite the tensions. Earlier this year, China's regulators approved Microchip Technology's acquisition of Microsemi and Bain Capital's acquisition of Toshiba's microchip unit. The Disney-Fox and United Technologies-Rockwell Collins deals may be less likely to attract scrutiny because they aren't as central to Chinese business as Qualcomm. The chip maker supplied essential parts for the country's big smartphone manufacturers. Even before the trade war, China applied more scrutiny to foreign companies. Mergers of foreign companies in China are six times more likely to be reviewed by the authorities there than deals between two Chinese companies, according to data compiled by the Rhodium Group. Chinese regulators have unfairly focused on foreign companies, including General Motors and Microsoft in recent years, instead of domestic companies, according to Liu Xu, a researcher at the Intellectual Property and Competition Law Research Center at Tongji University in Shanghai, who has studied the cases. It is unclear whether the Chinese authorities will scrutinize the Disney-Fox deal in particular, but experts said a deep review would be consistent with traditionally tight regulatory controls over foreign content and information. ""The party has been more interested in containing American influence in the cultural space and entertainment space,"" Mr. Chen, of the Asia Global Institute, said. ""Blocking such a deal would serve to keep the American influence away and also make a point to America."""
