briefing,2018-09-28,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/briefing/europe-friday-briefing.html,1338," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Historic testimony in the U.S. Senate, arrests in a Slovak journalist's murder, and a man chasing a plane in Ireland.  Here's the latest: • American history in real time. In emotional testimony before a Senate panel, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, above right, detailed the night on which, she said, she was ""100 percent"" certain that Brett Kavanaugh, then a suburban Washington prep school student and now a Supreme Court nominee, had sexually assaulted her. Later in the day, Mr. Kavanaugh, above left, who was equally emotional, told the panel he was ""100 percent"" sure he had not done so. The two very different versions of the truth, unfolding in the heated atmosphere of gender divides, #MeToo and the Trump presidency, could not be reconciled. As a nation watched transfixed, the testimony skittered from cringe-worthy sexual details to accusations and denials of drunken debauchery to one juvenile exchange over flatulence. At day's end, only a few of the senators who will determine Judge Kavanaugh's fate remained undecided, searching for answers where none were readily available, and Republicans vowed to push ahead with a Judiciary Committee vote today. _____ • Rapping and catcalling in France. Few had heard of Nick Conrad, above, a rapper from a Paris suburb. Then his violent music video, which calls for killing ""the white babies,"" started making the rounds, outraging French lawmakers and anti-racism groups. He may face prison. And a French court has fined a man 300 euros — about $350 — for making lewd and insulting comments to a woman aboard a bus in a Paris suburb. He was also jailed, for slapping her behind and hitting the bus driver. It was the first conviction under France's new law against sexist catcalls. _____ • A breakthrough in Slovakia.  Eight unidentified suspects were arrested in the killings of an investigative journalist, Jan Kuciak, and his fiancée. Mr. Kuciak had been digging into high-level corruption in Slovakia. The murders seven months ago led to the largest protests in the country since the fall of Communism and forced the resignation of the prime minister at the time, Robert Fico, who referred to journalists as ""presstitutes."" Above, a vigil in March for the victims. Investigative journalists continue to unravel the threads of corrupt dealings that Mr. Kuciak pulled on, and the inquiry into his murder goes on. ""There is still a long road to the final judgment,"" the interior minister said. _____ • Hailed as a hero, she's now under arrest.  Sarah Mardini, above right, a competitive swimmer from Syria, was called a hero for helping to save her fellow migrants on a sinking boat in 2015. Now she and four other people working for a Greek aid group face charges of aiding illegal immigration that could put them in prison for decades. • Elon Musk, Tesla's C.E.O., above, is being sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, accused of making false statements that could hurt investors. The suit, which relates to a Twitter post last month in which Mr. Musk announced he might take the automaker private, seeks to bar him from leading a publicly traded company like Tesla. • Striking pilots have forced Ryanair, the Irish budget airline, to cancel 100 more flights across Europe, bringing the total to 250 and disrupting travel for tens of thousands of passengers. • A California energy company says it has developed a rechargeable battery that can store power at far less than the cost of lithium-ion batteries. The battery units can be combined to create a microgrid system for powering a village or a larger area. • Japan agreed to enter bilateral trade talks with the U.S. The move gives President Trump a short-term victory, but it could be a delaying tactic to put off looming auto tariffs. •  Here's a snapshot of global markets. • ""My only sin is the extrajudicial killings,"" President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, above, said in a speech. That startling admission, apparently a reference to his bloody war on drugs, could add momentum to two cases filed against Mr. Duterte at the International Criminal Court. [The New York Times] • An Iraqi man and six other people were arrested in the Netherlands and charged with plotting a terrorist attack at a ""large event."" [The Guardian] • Israel's leader told the U.N. General Assembly that Iran is keeping a ""secret atomic warehouse"" in downtown Tehran, though he offered no proof. [The New York Times] • Italy's populist government unveiled a budget that would increase spending and aim to ""abolish poverty."" It puts the country on a potential collision course with European powers that want it to reduce its debt. [BBC News] • A prominent colonel in Russia's military intelligence service is one of the men accused of poisoning a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain this year, according to a group of investigative journalists. [The New York Times] • A late passenger at Dublin's airport chased down his plane, shouting for the pilot to wait. Arrested on the tarmac, he didn't make the flight. [BBC News] • Ion Ficior, convicted of crimes against humanity for running a Communist-era labor camp in Romania, died at 90.

Make creamy white beans with herb oil, paired with a salad and a good glass of wine. • Want to boost your career? Find a mentor. • Our best tips to decorate your home. • Luca Guadagnino, the director of the film ""Call Me by Your Name,"" has long dreamed of being an interior designer. Inside a former silk mill in Italy, on Lake Como, he got his shot. • Roller skates are making a comeback in the U.S. as a feminist uniform, our Styles section reports. Women on wheels ride ""in a gorgeous opalescent bubble, floating along, or stunting, or racing in a world void of unfair tennis umpires, sexist politicians and assaulting network C.E.O.s."" • In case you missed it: A seal slapped a New Zealand kayaker in the face with an octopus. Yes, you read that correctly. That ""moment of yuck,"" as the kayaker described it, was caught in a video that has gone viral. Appointed in 1791 to design what would become the city of Washington, Pierre L'Enfant was said to have been inspired by the design of the gardens at Versailles, the royal palace in his homeland of France. As part of his plan for the federal city, he envisioned ""a great church for national purposes."" The final stone at the Washington National Cathedral was placed almost 200 years later, on Sept. 29, 1990, 83 years after the building's foundation stone was dedicated by President Theodore Roosevelt. The cathedral is the sixth largest in the world and has been the site of state funerals for three presidents: Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his final Sunday sermon there, four days before he was assassinated in 1968. The gothic building features more than 100 gargoyles (including one of the ""Star Wars"" baddie Darth Vader) and more than 200 stained-glass windows, one of which contains a piece of lunar rock. Speaking at the dedication ceremony in 1990, President George H.W. Bush noted that the cathedral, which does not receive direct funding from the federal government, was built with the gifts of ""the people who were its congregation: the millions across America.""

News,2018-09-28,"HONG KONG — When Bill Jaynes realized water was rushing into the plane, he started to panic.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/world/asia/micronesia-plane-crash-rescue.html,676," HONG KONG — When Bill Jaynes realized water was rushing into the plane, he started to panic. Mr. Jaynes, a Micronesian journalist, was aboard a plane set to land on Weno, the tiny Pacific island that is part of the Federated States of Micronesia. ""I thought we landed hard until I looked over and saw a hole in the side of the plane and water was coming in,"" he said in a Facebook video, describing the landing of a Boeing 737-800 flown by Air Niugini at Chuuk International Airport on Friday morning. ""And I thought, well, this is not, like, the way it's supposed to happen."" But then help suddenly arrived — from a flotilla of local boats that rushed to the plane, which landed short of the runway in the Chuuk lagoon, and all 47 passengers aboard the aircraft were evacuated, according to early statement from the airline. ""It's just surreal,"" said Mr. Jaynes, managing editor of The Kaselehlie Press, a newspaper on Pohnpei, another Micronesian island. Matthew Colson, a Baptist missionary who lives on Weno, recorded the rescue effort and posted his interview with Mr. Jaynes on Facebook. He said the locals who rushed their boats to the scene were fisherman and construction workers, all locals. ""They're people that come here to go to work or go to the store or bring fish to the market to sell,"" Mr. Colson said. ""They just jumped in their boats and started helping."" In a statement, Air Niugini thanked the locals who had rushed to the plane's aid, and noted that a few passengers were injured in the incident. While the airline did not provide details of the cause of the crash, it said it had received information that ""the weather was very poor with heavy rain and reduced visibility at the time of incident."" While the airline first asserted that everyone on board made it off the aircraft, a day after the crash it issued a statement saying that one male passenger was still unaccounted for. But it could have been much worse. Images posted to social media showed the small boats racing to the site of the crash, surrounding the aircraft as it slowly sank in the lagoon, just off the airport. Pictures posted by bystanders two hours after the plane crashed showed it fully submerged in the water, which is up to 100 feet deep in some places. Video taken by rescuers show boats racing to retrieve passengers from the plane.  Aner Michael via Storyful Chuuk Lagoon is a popular diving destination and the site of sunken Japanese ships that were bombed by the American military during World War II. ""Chuuk has lot of outboard engines and boats out there,"" said Glenn Harris, an aviation security inspector for Micronesia's Department of Transportation. ""Everybody came together and rushed to the plane and rescued the passengers."" A United States Navy underwater construction team that was working in the area also helped in the rescue by shuttling passengers and crew members to shore in an inflatable boat, the Seventh Fleet said in a statement. Mr. Harris said initial reports suggested the plane was too low as it prepared to land and ended up short of the runway. The United States Embassy in Micronesia said in a statement that it was working to confirm the identities and the health and safety of any American passengers board the flight. After the crash, all flights in and out of the Chuuk International Airport were suspended. While the flight services to the island are limited, United Airlines operates a well-known ""Island Hopper"" flight across the Pacific from Honolulu to Guam that stops in five locations, including Chuuk. Air Niugini is Papua New Guinea's national carrier. Flight 73 was flying from Pohnpei, about 415 miles to the east, stopping in Chuuk before a scheduled leg to Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea. The 13-year-old aircraft reportedly sustained damage to its wing in May, when another aircraft that was taxiing at Jacksons International Airport in Port Moresby collided with it while it was parked and unoccupied. Mr. Jaynes, reflecting on the experience, said, ""I'm alive and that's an extremely good thing."""
News,2018-09-28,"Aimee Raupp-Temple and her husband, Ken Temple, rented instead of buying a house when they first moved from Brooklyn Heights to Westport, Conn., three years ago, because they weren’t sure they were ready to fully commit to the suburbs.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/realestate/rent-vs-buy-suburban-edition.html,1928," Aimee Raupp-Temple and her husband, Ken Temple, rented instead of buying a house when they first moved from Brooklyn Heights to Westport, Conn., three years ago, because they weren't sure they were ready to fully commit to the suburbs. ""It was a big move — neither of us had ever lived in Connecticut,"" said Ms. Raupp-Temple, 43, an author and acupuncturist.  Renting, it turned out, gave them time to figure out that they loved Westport. And yet, when their lease was up earlier this year, they decided to rent again.  Mr. Temple, 46, works in finance, and he was convinced that home prices, already dropping, would continue to decline. ""Our parents' mentality was, you bought your home and that was your major profit place. Now, I think people are a little more cautious,"" Ms. Raupp-Temple said.  In a real estate market tinged with so much uncertainty, renting at more than $5,000, $8,000 or even $10,000 a month feels like a safer bet these days to a number of people who could well afford to buy in the suburban counties of Fairfield and Westchester, where median sale prices in many towns are above $1 million. Indeed, demand for high-end single-family rentals is up significantly, a trend that dovetails with a decline in sales in New York and across portions of the region.  Many would-be buyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude toward a market softened by uncertainty over the new federal tax law and general uneasiness about the economy, even as mortgage interest rates continue to rise. They are less concerned about shelling out so much money for monthly rent than about making a costly purchase they may later regret. When the Temples and their young son first moved to Westport, they rented a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom home for just under $5,000 a month. The rent was no small sum, but in the city they had been paying more for less: $6,500 for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. Now they are waiting out the market in a rambling older home just over the border in Wilton, at $5,100 a month.  ""There are so many other ways to invest and make money than real estate now,"" Ms. Raupp-Temple said.  In Fairfield County, the volume of single-family rentals was up 13 percent in July compared to a year ago, according to data from the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. In Westchester County, it was up 9.6 percent.  Growth in single-family home rentals over the past few years has been most significant at the high end, agents said. The second-quarter market report from William Pitt/Julia B. Fee Sotheby's International Realty cited ""an exploding rental market"" among high-end properties in the southern part of Fairfield County, in particular.  Data provided by the firm showed that for the first half of 2018, the number of homes that rented for $5,000 or more a month in the county as a whole was up 33 percent, to 268, compared to 2015. That included 61 properties that rented for $10,000 or more, a 35 percent increase over 2015. In pricey towns like Greenwich, New Canaan, Darien and Westport, homes at the lower end of that rental range tend to be older properties with three or four bedrooms and a decent-size yard. Those going for closer to $10,000 usually have at least five bedrooms, mint-condition amenities and large lots or a beach-area location. Westchester also showed growth in high-end rentals, but at a slower pace of just over 12 percent, and almost exclusively in the southern end of the county.  ""I definitely see an increase in interest in rentals in the Bronxville area,"" said Kathleen Collins, an agent with William Pitt. The cost to rent a home in the affluent square-mile village typically runs between $10,000 and $16,000 a month. Nevertheless, Ms. Collins said she had been approached by more agents than usual this year asking whether properties she had listed for sale might instead be available to rent. In at least two cases where agents negotiated rental agreements with Ms. Collins, the clients were seeking rentals because they were relocating from abroad.  To meet this growing demand, more high-end sellers seem to be willing to rent, especially if they can't get the sale price they want. The number of homes offered for rent at $5,000 and up in Fairfield County during the first half of the year was 25 percent higher than five years ago, according to data from William Pitt. In Westchester, inventory was up 18 percent. Homeowners are opting to rent their homes out not just to wait for a stronger market, but also as a way to cut potential losses, said Jaime Sneddon, an associate broker with the New Canaan, Conn., office of William Pitt.  If a homeowner sells a primary residence for less than it was bought for, the loss does not qualify for a tax deduction. But if the homeowner rents the house for at least two years, it can be legally converted to an investment property for tax purposes, and any capital loss when it is sold can be written off against future income. ""Not everybody can afford to do that, but many of my clients have done it this year,"" Mr. Sneddon said. The growing demand for single-family rentals is sparked in part by concern about the financial impact of the new federal tax law, which caps income-tax deductions for property, state and local taxes at $10,000, said Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel. Further fueling anxiety, he said, are the effect of rising interest rates and the ""unclear economic policy"" coming out of Washington.  ""We're going through this era of uncertainty,"" Mr. Miller said. ""And what do buyers do when the near-term seems uncertain? They pause."" In towns where prices have been falling over the past year, there is simply no sense of urgency among affluent buyers, agents said. In New Canaan, for example, where the median sale price is around $1.5 million, property values have declined by 10 to 12 percent over the last 12 months, Mr. Sneddon said. At the same time, the number of sales for the year-to-date is off by about 15 percent.  ""People are just nervous that values will continue to decline, and for that reason, more people are opting to rent, if they are not forced to buy,"" he said.  The suburban rental market has always appealed to people moving to the area for a change of employment, but a hesitancy to buy seems more pronounced in the current uncertain market, with renters hedging their bets in case it turns out they don't stay in their jobs, said Helen R. Cusa, an agent with Halstead. She recently helped a family moving from Los Angeles rent a four-bedroom home, at $10,500 a month, in the Saugatuck section of Westport. Availability of rentals has been higher than usual this year in Westport because of an excess of homes for sale above $2.5 million, she said. Michelle and Jeremy Fine signed a two-year lease in March for a five-bedroom house in the Old Hill section of Westport. The couple, who have two children, ages five and three, had been living in a rented condo in White Plains, and considered buying there, but decided against it. ""The property taxes there are just astronomical,"" said Ms. Fine, 41, who helps out with her husband's education business, ConnectPrep. ""The change in the federal tax law was definitely a factor for us."" Like the Temples, they didn't want to buy in Westport until they had tried it out. ""I don't believe you're spending that much more on rent than you would on a mortgage,"" Ms. Fine said. ""Being in a home you purchased that is not the right fit is a bigger challenge if you have to sell. You have to weigh out what's more important."" Renting a house also gives longtime apartment dwellers time to figure out what they really want in single-family living. Since moving to Wilton, Ms. Raupp-Temple said, she has concluded that an older home is not for her — too much upkeep.  ""And I'm also getting a sense of how much space we need,"" she said. ""I think we would be fine with three bedrooms, two baths. You start to realize what your needs really are."" Insecurity about the market is also turning more sellers into renters, at least in the short term. Todd David Miller, a vice president of sales at the Higgins Group, said that of the $57 million in sales his team has done so far this year, primarily in the towns of Westport and Fairfield, almost all of the sellers have either moved out of state or are renting in the area. Those who are staying in the area are gravitating toward home rentals near the beach. ""These are mainly higher-end transactions, and the majority of them had to sell at a loss,"" Mr. Miller said. ""They don't want to put any more money into real estate right now.""  Leslie Razook, an agent with William Pitt, sees the same trend in the New Canaan and Greenwich markets. Baby boomers who have sold the family house are looking for rental homes in walkable neighborhoods near the center of New Canaan or a block off the Greenwich Avenue commercial district.  ""People are more careful in making these transitional decisions,"" she said. ""Particularly for people who have just sold a house — they don't want to get tied down right away.""  Over the summer, Scott and Nina Ackerman, both 49, decided not to buy immediately after selling the home in Rye, N.Y., where they lived for 17 years. Mr. Ackerman was transitioning out of a career on Wall Street to open Club Pilates studios in Fairfield County, and two of their three sons had gone away to school. But as the couple considered the ample supply of houses for sale in New Canaan and Darien, their preferred towns, they couldn't find exactly what they wanted. ""I felt like, why force the issue of buying when you can rent?"" Mr. Ackerman said.  They are now renting a four-bedroom home in Darien for $7,000 a month. And ""home prices seem to be coming our way,"" he said. ""We made a good sale, and I think we're going to have an opportunity."" Younger couples are also taking their time with those transitions. Harper and Scott Mates spent a year renting a seven-bedroom house in Rye, N.Y., before deciding to buy their own home there this summer. Coming from the city with three young children, they knew they wanted to stay within reasonable commuting distance of their jobs, but weren't certain Rye would be the best choice.  ""We both commute every day,"" said Ms. Mates, 36, who works in private equity. ""Renting afforded us the ability to say, well, actually maybe we want to be in Greenwich.""  Instead they fell for Rye, where the median sale price of a house was just under $2 million in July. As the end of their lease approached in August, they jumped on a five-bedroom house on an acre within a few days of its listing.  Renting for a year didn't necessarily enable them to get a better deal on a house, said Mr. Mates, 39, who also works in finance, but it prevented them from making a costly mistake. ""Spending all this money on rent for a year is a heck of a lot cheaper than buying a place we don't like and having to sell it and move again,"" he said.  And they know they are not alone in their thinking: At a recent play date with children in their oldest child's kindergarten class, the Mates met three other families who had done exactly the same thing.

News,2018-09-28,"If you haven’t visited a college campus, secondhand store or seen “Crazy Rich Asians,” in which one of the central characters possesses a Jamba Juice freebie card, you may not have heard: Thrift is cool.

In hospitality, that spirit has worked its way from Airbnb mania to spinoff hotel brands and independent properties that promise the travel equivalent of fast fashion. ""Cheap chic is in,"" said Chekitan Dev, a professor of marketing at Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration and the author of ""Hospitality Branding."" ""The cheap chic hotel brand trend is in line with tiny houses and other minimalist lifestyle trends that are sweeping the country."" Among new hotel introductions heeding the thrifty hip movement, InterContinental Hotels Group just launched Avid, a new brand featuring well-equipped gyms, Chobani yogurt and Kind granola in the breakfast buffets, and rates from $80. The stylish London-based Hoxton hotels made their American debut this month with the Hoxton, Williamsburg in New York, with three restaurants, a rooftop lounge and bed linens from the Brooklyn label Dusen Dusen in $159 rooms. The style-focused consortium Design Hotels recently introduced a ""luxe for less"" collection with rooms under 200 euros, or about $233. Bargains, of course, are relative to markets and perceptions. The hotel analytics firm STR identifies the average daily rate (known as A.D.R.) at hotels in the top 25 markets in the country over the past year as $130. That averages out places like New York, where annual A.D.R. is $240, along with Detroit at $104. The democratizing-design trend dovetails with the rise of millennial travelers. ""At an early stage of their travel cycle, millennials have less money to spend and are extremely value conscious,"" Prof. Dev said. ""They will pay only for those items that give them pleasure, so boring design, bad technology and unnecessary amenities are out and thoughtful and minimal design, fast and free technology and useful amenities are in."" But they're not the only ones driving the trend, according to Richard Born, a principal at BD Hotels, which anticipated downsized rooms with its first Pod Hotel in New York in 2007. The five Pod Hotels in New York and Washington, D.C., draw travelers of all ages who tend to share an interest in style. ""It's about price, but it's not just about price,"" Mr. Born said. ""It's about price, style, design and experience."" Challenged by Airbnb, major hotel groups have been expanding their vertical portfolios downward on the price scale and introducing more updated affordable brands. In addition to Avid, newcomers include Moxy Hotels from Marriott, which embraces a party spirit. At the new Moxy Chicago Downtown, for example, the front desk is a bar, and rooms that look into other rooms across a courtyard come with message boards to communicate things like ""Meet me in the lobby"" to the voyeur across the way (rooms from $170). The Dream Hotel Group introduced the playful Unscripted brand with its first Unscripted Durham in Durham, N.C., in a former 1960s-vintage motel with a rooftop pool and bar (from $129). It plans future openings in Belize and Mexico. In Israel, Brown Hotels spun off the free-spirited the Dave — Son of a Brown in Tel Aviv, which recently hosted a tattoo artist pop-up shop (from $125). In Japan, Hoshino Resorts launched Omo earlier this year with minimalist design (from about $45). Aiming to attract diverse travelers, some hotels offer a few tiny rooms at substantial savings. Among 14 rooms, Hotel Eleven in Austin, Tex., offers two 230-square-foot ""crashpads"" starting at $159. ""When people come to Austin, they don't really want to spend time in their hotel rooms,"" said Mark Vornberg, the hotel's co-owner and architect. ""The crashpad was developed as a place to sleep. It still has to have a great bed and a great shower, but it doesn't need a living room. The city is your living room."" When the 612-room Moxy Times Square opened in New York last year, it introduced 19 crash pad rooms for $99 each (others from $149). The 120 square-foot crash pads can only be ordered from the menu of the rooftop bar, Magic Hour, after 11 p.m. ""Our team anticipated that many of our rooftop patrons would like to 'take the elevator home,' keep the party going and crash downstairs,"" wrote Mitchell Hochberg, the president of Lightstone, which developed the hotel, in an email. A hotel with a luxe-to-less price range may also better serve groups like wedding parties, where budgets can vary. The East Austin Hotel, opening in November with a courtyard pool, restaurant and rooftop bar, will house 75 rooms, including 13 ""cabins,"" or rooms with double beds and shared bathrooms on a single floor, starting at $99. The highest-end poolside suites start at $299. ""It's all in one facility because the person that travels in a cabin this year may in fact want a poolside cabana next time,"" said Jeff Trigger, the founder and president of La Corsha Hospitality Group, which owns the East Austin. ""The people that are going to stay in our place want that eclectic style. They're not coming to be in an environment where everybody is the same."" A bargain in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in ski season, let alone a deal with decent design, is a winter unicorn. When I visited last January, rates at the slope-side Four Seasons Resort were $800, but in town, the 49-room Anvil Hotel, a newly redesigned 1950s motel, came close at $174. Double iron beds were dressed in Woolrich blankets and guests gathered around the rustic lobby's wood-burning potbelly stove. ""We realize there are more and more travelers out there who can't afford luxury but are looking for experiences that are in harmony with the environment in which they exist and those travelers shouldn't be deprived of good design,"" said Erik Warner, co-founder of Filament Hospitality, which owns the Anvil. ""You can provide good design without spending a lot of money."" In many cases, vintage roadside motels have provided hoteliers affordable properties with interesting midcentury bones to spruce up. The hotelier Liz Lambert did her first, the Hotel San Jose in Austin, nearly 20 years ago. Her newest, the Phoenix Hotel in San Francisco, a former 1956 motor court lodge, originally renovated in the late 1980s and popular with touring musicians, plays on its recent past with vintage concert posters in its 44 rooms and a lobby modeled on a recording studio (from $185). In Santa Ynez Valley in California, the Skyview Los Alamos — which started as the Skyview Motel in 1959 — reopened in April after a modern renovation brought wood floors, area rugs and vintage furnishings to its 33 rooms, some with outdoor showers and fire pits overlooking its vineyards. Many refashioned motels don't intend to be the destinations that many resorts aim to be. Built in 1963, the Astro in Santa Rosa, Calif., had fallen into disrepute when Liza Hinman and her partners, who also own the nearby restaurant Spinster Sisters, decided to buy it, renovate it in midcentury style and reopen the 34-room motel last year. Keeping the rooms affordable — they start at $156 — set the property apart. ""The hotel options in Sonoma County skew heavily to the luxury market,"" said Ms. Hinman. ""People coming to Santa Rosa for cycling or touring the microbreweries or for weddings, they didn't necessarily want all the luxury. They wanted a great, clean, functional, fun place to stay while they went about their vacation."""
News,2018-09-28,"If there was a moment tailor-made for a new book about women and rage, it would be now. And Rebecca Traister, a columnist at New York Magazine, has written it.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/nyregion/rebecca-traister-on-why-women-are-angry-its-not-just-kavanaugh.html,1782," If there was a moment tailor-made for a new book about women and rage, it would be now. And Rebecca Traister, a columnist at New York Magazine, has written it. ""Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women's Anger"" traces the complicated history of female fury, and what that fury has meant for social progress, starting with the suffragist and abolitionist movements of the 19th century and ending with the resistance to the Trump administration. The book went to print before the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, but that hasn't stopped Ms. Traister from sharing news and opinions swirling around the fast-moving and divisive story on Twitter. I tried to write about today, this week, all of it. https://t.co/7sri7utmb4 Last Friday, Ms. Traister, who has lived in New York for 21 years, spoke with The New York Times at the Stonewall Inn, a site mentioned in her book. The following interview is an edited and condensed version of the conversation.  There's an anecdote midway through your book where Cortney Tunis, the executive director of Pantsuit Nation, has a moment that many women in the city will understand. About getting angry at the men in suits in New York after the 2016 election? Exactly. When I first moved here, I had daily rage at the same scene: the barrage of white men in suits coming at me. The thing about the guys just charging through, taking up space and not caring if they push you out of the way — that works metaphorically with so much of the rage when we're talking about Donald Trump or Brett Kavanaugh. When you moved to New York, did you know what you wanted to pursue? I didn't know. I had an internship. I worked at Bath & Body Works. After I'd been here for about six months, I got a job working as an assistant to an actor, Harvey Keitel. O.K., I have so many questions. It's like one of these weird details of my life. I remember hearing stories about Harvey Keitel in the '90s. This is when you were working for him? The very early part of my career, which had nothing to do with feminism and nothing to do with journalism, offered a view of power that I think that I, without realizing it, learned a lot from. I had a tremendously close view of Hollywood power because I worked for Keitel. I met very famous people. You were conscious of the power structure? I saw so many behaviors that entailed an abuse of tremendous power and money. I was small, and sometimes that really helps you get a clear view, because no one thinks you're paying attention. No one considers you a person with eyes and a brain. When did you find your voice as a writer? In the fall of 2003, I was offered a job at Salon. Around this time I was realizing my value on the market was writing about my own sex life. Wait — 100 percent true. It was the era of ""Sex and the City,"" and my market value at that point was first-person columns about my life in New York. You wrote a dating column? Well, I was not really dating. I think I was totally single. There was not any sex, really. So I would write about my work life. It was in Mademoiselle, and then it shut down after I wrote three columns. I needed money; I had a friend at Allure who offered me $1,000 to do a review of sex toys, which I did. That was the freelance work I could get. It was not uncommon at the time. There was a tremendous appetite for young women writers to write first person. So I got a job working at Salon. It was the section called Life, and it sort of encompassed all the sort of stuff that wasn't politics, science … The ""Lady Pages."" It was the Lady Pages, but it was also religion, parenthood, sex. I was thrilled. I was writing mostly pop culture criticism, I was encouraged to have more voice. Some of them were really ham-handed attempts to give voice to a feminist perspective. In 2006, my boss kind of forced me to write a big piece about Hillary Clinton. I was not a Hillary Clinton fan. Interesting. I saw her as a total centrist sellout. I'd been kind of turned off by what I felt like she had to do in order to gain stature within the Senate. It was when Hillary ran for president in 2008 that I began writing about politics. I wrote my first book, which was about the gender dynamics, racial dynamics and classism around Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin and Michelle Obama. And how that election, and those three women, offered such remarkable stories. How did you turn to the topic of women's anger? I was thinking that I might write a book if Hillary Clinton had won. I'd felt the rise of racism and misogyny during the presidential campaign. The pop culture backlash: the fury of the all-women Ghostbusters and Star Wars jedis who weren't white guys. I felt like we were in the midst of an extremely punishing moment. And that's what I guessed I might be writing about throughout Hillary Clinton's administration, if there was one. And then there wasn't one. But in early 2017, I was walking with my husband, and I felt like my brain was going to boil. I was telling him how it was hard for me to think because I was so angry. He said to me, ""Well maybe that's your book: anger."" I was like, ""Of course, that's my book."" [Read this essay on the power of women's anger, which includes a review of Rebecca Traister's ""Good and Mad.""] Every female activist you mention in the book is angry and also did something about it. The personal and the political seem impossible to separate. You can't. People tell you how bad anger is for you. If it's inside of you, it's going to corrode and poison you. I think it's the bottling it up or swallowing it down or thinking that there's no outlet for it — that's the thing that corrodes. Do you think we're in a new wave of feminism? I don't love the ""wave"" term. If you think about the first wave, it extended a century. Are we in a moment of a major social and political uprising driven by women's anger? Yes. But will this extend to the rest of our lives? I suspect it probably will. I suspect we are not looking at something that in 10 years we'll say, ""Oh, remember that? Remember when that wave happened?"" You write a lot about how racial and sexist divisions in social movements can hinder group efforts. Meanwhile, the city is changing. Some neighborhoods have lost that sense of community that can lead to activism. For example, here we sit at the Stonewall Inn, where I suggested we meet because you wrote about it in your book. It is considered the birthplace of the gay rights movement. And yet —  I'd read enough about Stonewall to know that it was more complicated than the pop culture picture of it. But I think most of us were given the pop culture version of it. Right. I was thinking about all the history where the anger of women was catalytic but has been obscured. There's the labor movement too; in the popular imagination it's white male teamsters, coal miners. But in fact, a lot of the labor organizers were young working women in the factories and mills, like Clara Lemlick and Rose Schneiderman, who gave some of the most furious oratory calls for the New York Shirtwaist strike in 1909. And actually it was a colleague of mine who mentioned Stonewall. And Stormé DeLarverie. Who was Stormé DeLarverie? Stormé was a lesbian singer/performer who was taken out by police, and on her way out, some people said she fought the policemen. Others report she had said to the onlookers who had gathered outside, ""Why don't you guys do something?"" This spurred them to eventually storm the bar. She was a catalytic figure on that night, along with Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, female-identifying drag performers of color. Stormé was African-American, and yet those figures aren't the ones who leap to mind in a popular discussion of the origins of the gay rights movement. Stonewall mostly remains understood as an uprising of white gay men. This happens in the women's movement too. Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Thurgood Marshall have both credited Pauli Murray, who is a black, non-gender-conforming woman, with writing the law that undergirded civil rights and gender discrimination. The fury and the work and the organizing, much of it born out of anger at injustice, which was done by women of color, is so often erased in the retelling. Maybe, in terms of whatever wave we're in now, that's the difference. Black women are not being erased anymore. Well, if you look at the women's march, the origins are with white female organizers who originally tried to call it the million women's march without acknowledging that it had been the name of an event staged by black women in Philadelphia years earlier. I agree that one of the projects of a contemporary women's movement is to correct that. You can see the same with #MeToo. Tarana Burke is the person who developed the #metoo movement, which was originally supposed to be about telling the stories of sexual predation and assault specifically for women and girls of color. Now, in some circles, #metoo is understood to have been invented by white women in Hollywood. So this is one of the fundamental questions of the book: in our anger, can we find coalition? What do you think is going to happen with Kavanaugh?  I have no idea. After Anita Hill, I don't think people understood the long tail of what women's rage was going to produce. I would argue that the tail of the Anita Hill fury got us to #MeToo. We are still processing it. Anita Hill has been the through line in my thinking about women, gender, race and power in this country for 27 years. I don't think you can begin to conceive of what the impact is going to be on the women who are watching this Kavanaugh thing happen. I think what we are constantly underestimating in this country is the reaction of those — what I talked about in the beginning of this interview, in my earliest jobs, the eyes that are watching and thinking even if they're not putting it all in a framework yet."

Op-Ed,2018-09-28,"GUANGZHOU, China — Earlier this month, Jack Ma announced that he was stepping down as executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the world’s largest e-commerce company. His decision caught many by surprise. At an economic forum in Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin reportedly asked him, “You are still so young. Why are you retiring?”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/opinion/jack-ma-alibaba-china-economy.html,1132," GUANGZHOU, China — Earlier this month, Jack Ma announced that he was stepping down as executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the world's largest e-commerce company. His decision caught many by surprise. At an economic forum in Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin reportedly asked him, ""You are still so young. Why are you retiring?"" Maybe Mr. Ma, 54, knows something that Mr. Putin does not. Two of the three forces, globalization and marketization, that have propelled Alibaba to its current $500 billion valuation are dissipating. The third force, technology, is mired in the trade war between China and the United States, and its prospects in China are now uncertain. Alibaba didn't just transform e-commerce in China; it transformed the entire economy by helping build up the private sector. Mr. Ma's departure from the company now — though he claims to have been planning it for a while — adds to a gathering sense that China's private sector, the engine of the economy, is losing steam — and faith. Alibaba is China's globalization story par excellence. Founded in 1999, the company created a website that allowed people outside China to buy directly from Chinese exporters. At that time, China was opening up but foreign buyers were hampered by their lack of knowledge of Chinese suppliers. Alibaba set up a program called TrustPass, allowing third parties to verify the quality and trustworthiness of Chinese suppliers. This system enabled foreign buyers to bypass the slow and often bureaucratic state-owned intermediaries that typically performed verification, and it eased Chinese companies' access to the global marketplace. Alibaba also tapped international capital markets. The company's founders hailed from modest backgrounds and had little capital, but they benefited from liberal policies that China had put in place as it was negotiating to join the World Trade Organization (which it did join, in 2001). During the company's early years, its leaders turned to foreign suppliers of capital, such as Goldman Sachs, SoftBank and Fidelity Investments. Later on, Yahoo also provided funding. In the early 2000s, Alibaba structured its investment arrangements via what are known as ""variable interest entities."" V.I.E.s are intermediary structures in which foreign firms can invest to acquire contractual rights over revenues generated by Alibaba. They were an innovative solution to help foreigners navigate China's murky legal system while bringing critical financing to Chinese high-tech entrepreneurs. But today globalization is under assault. The Chinese government is enforcing more strictly regulations over V.I.E.s that it had long ignored, creating uncertainty for foreign investors. And the trade war between the United States and China is disrupting Chinese exports, threatening the supply chains of which Alibaba is an integral component. Alibaba has elevated China's private entrepreneurs in another way: by providing direct financing to them. China has a massive banking system, but it is almost entirely organized to support the less efficient state-owned enterprises, leaving China's dynamic private sector chronically short of capital and credit. Alibaba, through its financing operations, has stepped in to provide much-needed capital, especially to China's very small businesses. But Alibaba is operating against broader political and economic headwinds, and China is now reducing the indebtedness of its economy, mostly by cutting credit to the private sector. As a result, according to one analysis in The Wall Street Journal, interest burdens on private companies have risen, whereas they have fallen for state-owned enterprises (and returns on assets, a measure of profitability, have fallen for private companies while rising for S.O.E.s). The government, fearing the instability of shadow banking, is also stepping up controls on independent funding channels. For example, it has tightened regulations on some forms of mobile payment, like those operated by Alibaba. Such financial controls are likely to increase in the future. Under increasingly tight financial and regulatory pressures, China's private sector today arguably is facing the most challenging environment since the early 1990s. According to the chief economist of China Merchant Bank, all 11,000 businesses that went bankrupt between 2016 and the first half of 2018 were private. After liberalizing the economy for nearly four decades, the government appears to be reversing course. By one count, 10 privately owned groups have in effect been nationalized this year, when, strapped for financing because of tightening credit controls, they sold their equity stakes to S.O.E.s. The Chinese government even seems openly hostile toward the private sector. A vice-minister of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security recently said that private enterprises should be ""jointly"" run by private entrepreneurs and workers. The comment smacked of Mao Zedong's justification for nationalizing China's private sector in the mid-1950s. In a recent blog post, one Wu Xiaoping, who identified himself as a ""veteran in China's financial sector,"" argued that China's private sector, having helped ""the state-owned economy in achieving its rapid development,"" should not ""blindly expand"" but instead embrace mixed ownership. The essay caused widespread consternation — even a degree of panic — among Chinese entrepreneurs. In conversations I had in Guangdong, business leaders from various sectors — product design, investment, technology — called the current situation ""dire."" They said they were making far fewer deals, as much as 50 percent less, now than during the same period last year and complained about the toll of increasing taxes. The third leg of Alibaba's growth, technology, is also shakier now than when the company was founded. Technology itself continues to develop rapidly, but both the United States and China want to go it alone. The Trump administration is limiting Chinese investments in American technology. The Chinese government's ""Made in China 2025"" initiative, a vast program to develop advanced manufacturing, curbs foreign participation with equity restrictions and onerous requirements about technology transfer. These are not the conditions that allowed Alibaba to succeed. The company was a pioneer in adopting Western technology and business models — using online commerce, data analytics, website tools — to the Chinese context. Although it is often called China's Amazon, the comparison vastly understates its true significance. Alibaba started out as a business-to-business operation but, really, it gave market opportunities to private entrepreneurs in a statist system heavily stacked against them. Many of these entrepreneurs are located in remote rural regions, and China has a highly uneven distribution of income and production. Income is concentrated in a few metropolitan centers, whereas production is distributed throughout the country. Alibaba connects production in these disparate regions to the sources of market demand and consumption. The links it provides aren't just technological; they are broadly economic. So why is the Chinese government clamping down on the private sector when liberalizing it has served the economy so well? The reasons are varied and complex: rising authoritarianism at home, statism, the trade war. But the effects already are clear, with ominous implications for the entire economy. Could there even be a new Alibaba today?"
News,2018-09-28,Good Friday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/business/dealbook/elon-musk-tesla-sec.html,1527," Good Friday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The S.E.C. has accused the Tesla C.E.O. of fraud over his brief effort to take the carmaker private. Mr. Musk reportedly backed out of a settlement with the agency Thursday morning, adamant that he had done nothing wrong. If the commission convinces a jury that Mr. Musk misled investors, he could be blocked from serving as an executive or director of any public company. That could force him to assume a different position at Tesla. It could also affect his other companies, SpaceX and the Boring Company, were they to go public, and potentially harm their ability to raise money from investors. The S.E.C. lawsuit, filed on Thursday in federal court, said that Mr. Musk had made a false public statement by tweeting that he had ""funding secured"" to buy out Tesla investors. Some legal experts think he has a tough battle ahead: Charles Elson of the University of Delaware called the case ""as straightforward as you can get."" Andrew's take: Mr. Musk will want to prove that his intent wasn't to mislead investors, probably by demonstrating that he had real conversations to take the company private. But his intent is almost beside the point. He can be found guilty simply for being ""reckless."" And naïveté isn't a defense. This is turning into a sad story for Tesla's employees, investors and ultimately everyone who has followed Mr. Musk's efforts to transform the auto and energy industries. Nearly $3.3 trillion worth of mergers have been announced this year, the FT reports. That's the strongest showing for the first nine months of a year since 2007, and puts deal making in 2018 on a potentially record-setting pace. The data suggest that companies still feel confident enough about the economy to strike big deals. Much of this year's activity was driven by giant takeovers like Walt Disney's acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox and T-Mobile's proposed acquisition of Sprint. What remains to be seen is whether trade wars and other economic sandbags will weigh down the M.&A. run. More in M.&A.: The investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners reportedly hired advisers for a potential I.P.O., betting on the M.&A. boom to create investor interest in its offering. In March 2017, State Street Global Advisors, one of the world's largest fund managers, pushed companies to put more women on corporate boards. FactSet has crunched the numbers, and there's a long way to go: • Companies in the Russell 3000 stock index with no female board members declined to 18 percent, from 23 percent. • Companies in which women hold 15 percent of the board seats or less decreased to 47 percent, from 58 percent. • The boards of 22 companies are equally split between men and women, while women make up the majority at 14 companies, up from five. • Just 5 percent of companies in the index are led by women, unchanged from March 2017. The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony struck many commentators as credible, but Judge Kavanaugh's fiery defense may give Republican senators cover to approve his nomination. Google's C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, will meet with Republican lawmakers. He is expected to discuss the company's work in China, its market dominance and allegations of political bias in its search results. The Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish consumer spending data. Spending is expected to have risen 0.3 percent in August, compared to a 0.4 percent rise in July. Personal income is also expected to have grown 0.4 percent. The yield curve is essentially the difference between interest rates on short-term government bonds and long-term government bonds. Every time since 1960 that it has inverted — when long-term rates are lower than short-term rates — a recession has followed. For much of this year, the spread has been at its narrowest level in more than a decade. Many economists believe it will invert next year. But Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, has played down the yield curve's significance as an omen. The curve is ""just one factor that you want to look at"" when setting interest-rate policy, he said. Of the economy as a whole, he added, ""there's no reason to think that the probability of a recession in the next year or two is at all elevated."" Counterpoint: Martin Feldstein, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan and a professor at Harvard, argues in a WSJ op-ed that a long, deep recession is looming — and the Fed has few tools to solve it. SoftBank and other investment firms are reportedly in talks to invest in Bytedance, a Chinese tech company that owns the video service Tik Tok. The deal could value the company at $75 billion, which would make it one of the most valuable venture-backed start-ups around. More from Lulu Yilun Chen, Selina Wang and David Ramli of Bloomberg on why Bytedance is so attractive: Six-year-old Bytedance, which was said to be seeking around $3 billion in the current round, started out by using artificial intelligence to personalize content for users but has successfully branched out into short-video via a service called Douyin, known as Tik Tok abroad. That service had 500 million monthly active users as of July. It also owns the Musical.ly app, which has about 100 million users and is being merged with Tik Tok, the company said in August. One reason for investor caution: With companies like Tencent getting involved in short video, Tik Tok may struggle to grow in a saturated market. Apple's business model is different from those of other tech giants: Instead of generating cash from advertising, it simply sells expensive products. In his latest column, Farhad Manjoo of the NYT considers how that has insulated the iPhone maker from most of the tech industry's troubles in recent years. But he also wonders what might happen if other companies embraced its vision: If Apple's more deliberate business becomes the widely followed norm, we could see an industry that is more careful about tech's dangers and excesses. It could also be one that is more exclusive, where the wealthy get the best innovations and the poor bear more of the risks. The financial crisis ruined Goldman Sachs's reputation in the eyes of the public. Ten years on, it is finally out of the doghouse. Data from YouGov shows that slightly more Americans would feel ""proud,"" rather than ""embarrassed,"" to work at Goldman. That's after the firm spent years trying to rehabilitate its image. But let's not get carried away. On YouGov's reputation scale, which runs from -100 to 100, Goldman crawled into positive territory with a score of 1. Jeffrey Davis has stepped down as C.F.O. of J.C. Penney. Bed Bath & Beyond will keep Victoria Morrison as a director despite investors voting her out. Natalie Baylis is stepping down as head of compliance at GAM, the troubled Swiss investment firm.

But in China, the titans of social media are still getting bigger and richer. Bytedance, the creator of the news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, the video-sharing service Tik Tok and a fleet of other entertainment apps, is in discussions to raise new funding that would value the business at $75 billion, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential talks. The Japanese conglomerate SoftBank is among the investors involved in the talks, one of these people said. A $75 billion valuation would make Bytedance one of the world's most valuable private tech companies — Uber was recently valued at $76 billion. It would also give Bytedance financial heft comparable to that of some publicly traded high-tech leaders. Baidu, maker of China's dominant search engine, has a market capitalization of around $80 billion. A spokeswoman for Bytedance declined to comment. The talks with SoftBank were reported earlier by The Information. In the six years since the company's founding, Bytedance's apps have become a major draw for users — and advertisers — in the world's largest online population. And the company wants to conquer phone screens far beyond China, too. Last year, it bought Musical.ly, a video-based social network popular with teenagers in the United States and Europe, and folded it into Tik Tok. Musical.ly had been notable for being one of the rare Chinese social media companies to have attracted a significant following outside China. Today, half a billion people worldwide use either Tik Tok or its Chinese edition, Douyin, every month, Bytedance says. By comparison, Instagram, where short, homemade videos are also a major draw, has more than a billion users. Coming from China, where the government maintains strict and ever-changing controls on information, Bytedance has weathered unique turbulence as it has grown. Last year, the company had to suspend updates to its news app Toutiao after China's internet regulator accused it of spreading unsavory material. This April, a Bytedance app for sharing bawdy jokes and videos was ordered offline entirely. The authorities in Indonesia briefly banned Tik Tok this year for hosting ""negative"" content. Zhang Yiming, Bytedance's founder and chief executive, offered a display of contrition after the joke app, Neihan Duanzi, was shuttered. He apologized for the company's failure to respect ""core socialist values,"" and thanked China's government for enabling tech start-ups' rapid development. Mr. Zhang also said that Bytedance would expand its team for monitoring content to 10,000 people from 6,000."
News,2018-09-28,My dresser would have to go. Leave two dressers in a master bedroom and a potential buyer might suspect the closets are small.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/realestate/its-showtime-staging-a-house-for-sale.html,1262," My dresser would have to go. Leave two dressers in a master bedroom and a potential buyer might suspect the closets are small. Spoiler alert: They are small. That wouldn't be the only change I'd have to make if I put my house on the market and opened it up to a parade of strangers. My new bedspread, the one I bought after a year of searching for the perfect midcentury look, wouldn't cut it, either. Instead, my bedroom was apparently begging for a fluffy white duvet with plenty of throw pillows. Throw pillows, you see, are key to selling a house. They should be big, bold and abundant, or so I've been told. I'd invited my real estate broker over to help me decide whether I should sell my house and buy a larger one. As she toured my home, telling me what would need to be done to make it more appealing to potential buyers, I began to see that readying a house for sale is not unlike decorating a stage for a play, and perhaps just as hard. Consider these two basic rules of home staging. One: Your house should not appear to be lived in by real people who own stuff. Two: Buyers, who by their very nature apparently lack imagination, are wowed by ""greige,"" a color neither gray nor beige, but one where personal flair goes to die. (In other words, paint all your walls a pale shade of greige.) She pointed to a light fixture at the top of the stairs that had been installed by a previous owner and that, I admit, is dated. But who really cares about a small, yet surprisingly effective, fixture at the top of the stairs? Buyers, that's who. ""They'll see it out of the corner of their eye, they might not even realize it,"" she said. ""But they'll think of their grandmother."" And if there's one person you do not want buyers thinking about when they tour your house, it's grandma. ""They'll think your house is old,"" she explained, and trotted down the stairs. But my house is old, I thought. And so I began to see my house not as the place where I live my life, but as a set to be dressed so someone else could briefly live out a fantasy as they wandered through it. And then maybe pay me a lot of money. Home staging has become big business. What was once an indulgence for the luxury market has trickled down to the middle market, with sellers shelling out huge sums to transform their living rooms, kitchens and bedrooms into (greige) resort-like retreats meant to wow a potential buyer into not noticing that the living room is oddly shaped, with no logical place to put a television, or that the bathroom window looks out on the air shaft from the neighboring apartment building. A 2017 National Association of Realtors survey found that 38 percent of brokers staged all of their listings, up from 34 percent in 2015, with almost half of those brokers reporting that staging a home increased the selling price.  The trend has been fueled in part by an endless loop of home makeover shows on networks like HGTV, where we watch homeowners burst into tears of joy at the sight of a shag rug and a statement wingback chair. There's a good chance the furniture will be gone with the production crew, just like the furniture in that house or apartment you buy. But somehow, a well-appointed room convinces us that the perfect home is just one oversized brass mirror away. ""You're creating a dream for the buyer,"" said Donna M. Dazzo, the president of Designed to Appeal, a New York City home-staging company. ""We're just emotional creatures and we're shopping based on emotion.""  But the dream doesn't come cheap: Staging an empty property costs around 1 to 3 percent of the list price, depending on the region of the country, according to the Real Estate Staging Association. Sellers typically pay for the work. Even those who don't spend thousands of dollars on a wholesale transformation do spend weeks cleaning, clearing out clutter, repositioning the furniture and, of course, tossing around the throw pillows, all to make their home feel like an idealized version of itself. Scott Hunter and Joe Fazio spent $28,000 this summer staging their two-bedroom condo in the South Street Seaport in Manhattan. It had been sitting on the market for a year with no bites, so their broker, Amy Stein of Corcoran, suggested they stage it and drop the price to $1.995 million.  Mr. Hunter and Mr. Fazio, both of whom worked in finance before they retired, were surprised by the transformation, particularly by how the stager, Studio D, managed to make an oddly shaped foyer look like a useful sitting room with a small sofa and coffee table. They were as dazzled as they hoped some future buyer might be. ""We said: Wow!"" Mr. Fazio said. ""For the first time, that space comes alive."" Between the makeover and the lower price (the apartment was originally listed for $2.45 million), the open houses have been busier, and the listing has gotten more traffic online, Mr. Fazio said. But no one has made an offer yet. Staging is ultimately more about theater than interior design. Stagers select an accent chair not because it would make for a great spot to curl up and read a book, but because it's just the right size to make that weird nook look useful. No one expects the buyer to really live that way, and in some cases, you wouldn't even want to try. ""Never sit on a staged bed,"" warned Jane Saidenberg, the managing director of the New York office of Studio D. ""Sometimes we have to MacGyver it."" Do some house hunting and odds are your broker (the same one who may have insisted you stage your old place) will spend the day reminding you to ignore the flawless bowl of fruit on the kitchen table, and instead look at the countertop beneath it — the thing you're actually buying. But who wants to think about boring stuff like boilers and square footage? Instead, staging lets you walk in and ""go on a journey,"" as Ms. Saidenberg put it. It is meant to divert your eye from the shortcomings, so you can see the potential, and maybe have a little fun imagining what your life would be like after you dole out a huge sum of money. ""Why are you O.K. with walking out of Anthropologie paying $100 for a T-shirt?"" my broker, Leslie Kunkin, a sales associate for West of Hudson Realty Group in Montclair, N.J., asked me soon after she toured my house. ""When you walk into the store it feels different, and when you get home, you've got that nice waxy bag."" But unlike an Anthropologie T-shirt, you can't return the house if you later realize that it doesn't fit. As I considered all I'd have to do to package my house properly, I began to wonder about those other staged houses, the ones I would be looking at if I decided to move. Would I be able to see through the theater and actually know if the house was worth all the effort and money it would take to buy it? Or would I be distracted by the shiny objects and get swept up in the fantasy? So I decided to put the fantasy future on hold for now and continue to make do with my small closets and the two dressers in the master bedroom.

News,2018-09-29,"When Thursday began, Elon Musk had a deal on the table.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/business/elon-musk-tesla-sec-deal.html,1394," When Thursday began, Elon Musk had a deal on the table. After days of tense negotiations, the Securities and Exchange Commission and lawyers for Mr. Musk, Tesla's chief executive, had agreed on a settlement that would bring to a close a drama that has riveted Wall Street and Silicon Valley for the past two months. Under the terms of the agreement, what started on Aug. 7 — when Mr. Musk posted on Twitter that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private for $420 a share — would end with some modest penalties and Mr. Musk staying on as chief executive, according to two people briefed on the talks. The plan, as it was negotiated by lawyers, was for Mr. Musk to step down as chairman of Tesla within 45 days and not resume that post for two years. The company, also a party to the proposed agreement, would add two new directors to its board. Mr. Musk and the company would pay tens of millions of dollars in fines, according to the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The negotiators planned to announce the agreement on Thursday after the markets closed. But for Mr. Musk — an emotional, volatile and cocksure billionaire — the deal was unacceptable. The settlement with the S.E.C. was a ""neither admit nor deny"" deal, meaning that Mr. Musk would not have acknowledged knowingly committing a violation. Mr. Musk, however, would not have been allowed to publicly state that he had done nothing wrong — and that was something he couldn't accept, according to three people familiar with the talks. So on Thursday morning, as settlement papers were being drawn up and news releases were being drafted, Mr. Musk walked away. Lawyers, Tesla executives and advisers to the company were stunned that he would turn away from such a favorable settlement. And the S.E.C., taken aback, quickly changed course and upped the ante significantly. On Thursday afternoon, the agency sued Mr. Musk, seeking to bar him from serving as an executive or a director of a public company. If it wins, Mr. Musk will lose the company he co-founded. Tesla stock fell 14 percent on Friday. ""The company's brand and stock will suffer if he leaves,"" said Mike Ramsey, an auto analyst at Gartner. ""But I hate to say it, they might be better off."" Tesla has lurched from crisis to crisis over the past year, and has been scrambling to contain the fallout from Mr. Musk's tweet, which touched off a market frenzy that sent Tesla's shares soaring, and prompted federal regulators to examine whether Mr. Musk had misled investors with a surprise declaration that vastly overstated reality. On Friday, the S.E.C. set a date of Feb. 1 for a preliminary hearing on the case, leaving plenty of time for Mr. Musk to change his mind and agree to a settlement, albeit a potentially less favorable one. But the lawsuit, which could take years to come to trial, will cast a cloud over the company as long as the matter remains unresolved. In recent weeks, the S.E.C. was preparing to send Tesla a Wells Notice, signaling that it intended to bring civil charges against the company and Mr. Musk. But by Thursday, after the settlement talks fell apart, the S.E.C. narrowed its focus. Instead of looking to settle with the company and Mr. Musk, it sued Mr. Musk alone, according to a person close the company. After the commission began to investigate Mr. Musk's assertion on Twitter, his lawyers sent two lengthy letters to regulators making their case that he had done nothing wrong, according to that person. The letters outlined meetings that Mr. Musk had had with officials from a Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, which had led him to believe he had financial support to take Tesla private, the person said. On an evening in March 2017, for example, Mr. Musk and Tesla's chief financial officer dined at the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., with Larry Ellison, the chairman of Oracle, and Yasir Al Rumayyan, the managing director of the Saudi Public Investment Fund. During the meal, the letters said, Mr. Rumayyan raised the idea of taking Tesla private and increasing the Saudi fund's stake in it. More than a year later, the lawyers said, Mr. Musk and Mr. Rumayyan met at the Tesla factory on July 31. When Mr. Rumayyan spoke again of taking the company private, Mr. Musk asked him whether anyone else at the fund needed to approve of such a significant deal. Mr. Rumayyan said no, according to the person familiar with the letters. Representatives for Mr. Ellison and the Saudi investment fund did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday evening. People familiar with the workings of the Saudi fund previously said it had taken none of the steps that such an ambitious transaction would entail, like preparing a term sheet or hiring a financial adviser to work on the deal. Mr. Musk and other Tesla executives told Tesla's board about the talks with the Saudis, the lawyers wrote, according to the person familiar with the letters. On Aug. 3, Mr. Musk shared his idea for the $420 share price with the board. It was an Aug. 7 Financial Times story that spurred Mr. Musk to action, the lawyers said in the letters to the commission. An alarm bell went off when he saw the newspaper's report that the Saudis had built up a significant stake in Tesla. He feared that word would get out that a deal to take Tesla private was possible. So he began to tweet, the lawyers said. His tweets, the lawyers wrote, were sent in good faith. He believed that the Saudis were capable of doing a deal and interested in doing one, and that what remained was a matter of details, according to the person familiar with the letters. One sticking point for Mr. Musk in the tentative S.E.C. settlement was the particular statute which he was said to have violated. That statute contains language about misleading investors. Mr. Musk's lawyers wanted the commission to change its claim to say he was merely negligent in his statement, according to a person familiar with the details of the negotiations. Mr. Musk was concerned about what those terms might mean for his other businesses, SpaceX and the Boring Company. He was worried the agreement could jeopardize those companies' ability to continue working for the government, the person said. In a statement after the commission filed its suit on Thursday, Mr. Musk called the agency's enforcement effort ""unjustified."" ""I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors,"" he said. ""Integrity is the most important value in my life, and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way."" Mr. Musk's decision to back away from the settlement could complicate Tesla's future. He has said the company will be consistently profitable by the end of this year, propelled by sales of its newest car, the midsize Model 3 sedan. But Tesla has struggled to meet its production targets for the Model 3, and has continued to burn through cash while two bond payments totaling more than a billion dollars will come due in the next six months. Tesla had $2.2 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, but has been using up nearly a $1 billion every three months. It also has about $11 billion in debt, and owed its suppliers $3 billion as of June 30. Mr. Musk has said Tesla won't seek additional capital. But Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA Research, said he believed Tesla will have do so in the first half of 2019. Mr. Musk's legal troubles will only make it more difficult for the company to issue bonds or secure other financing. ""The best case is they can get access to capital but it's more expensive than they would like,"" Mr. Nelson said. ""The worst case is they won't be able to raise capital."" Another uncertainty for investors is who will ultimately be at the helm of Tesla. Mr. Musk is Tesla's visionary, much like Steve Jobs was at Apple, Mr. Nelson said, and belief in him is one of the reasons investors have bet on Tesla shares. ""He's critical, in our opinion,"" Mr. Nelson said."

He did it under the auspices of the house of Celine, and he did it with Celine-branded Champagne miniatures and a (literal) drumroll, thanks to members of the Republican Guard. He did it with a specially constructed backdrop of his own design made from transmuting silver squares that looked like they had beamed in from planet Krypton. He did it with 96 looks on concave, skinny boys and cranky, baby-faced girls. And fashion, which had been on the edge of its seat, fell off. Déjà vu! It was disorienting: what year was this? But at least some questions had been answered. For those who, upon hearing that Mr. Slimane had been named Lord Chief Overseer (O.K.: artistic, creative and image director) of Celine, feared that the days when this brand defined what it meant to be a smart, adult, self-sufficient, ambitious and elegantly neurotic woman were at an end — you were right. For those who worried that maybe, after reinventing Dior Homme in his own Thin Dark Duke image, and Saint Laurent in the shape of dissolute morning-after Los Angeles teenagers, perhaps Mr. Slimane did not have another brand vision in him — you were right, too. And for those who asked whether brand Hedi would take precedence over brand Celine — well, yup. None of this was really surprising. Nor was the fact that the collection was almost entirely in black and white, plus a bit of gold and silver, with a dash of green and red thrown in. Or that for girls, it mostly consisted of super short 1980s baby doll prom dresses with metallic poufs, motorcycle boleros and some very slick tailoring (oh — and one pair of baggy acid-washed jeans with a little fur chubby).  Or that for boys, it was the tailoring again: narrow pleated trousers hiked high on the waist and cropped in at the ankle; razor-sharp jackets, both double- and single-breasted, long and short; skinny ties.  Or that the distinguishing characteristic between the two was mainly black trapezoidal glasses for the boys and little haute flea-market fascinator veils for the girls. Plus some nicely bourgeois chain handbags. Mr. Slimane has done all this before.  96 Photos View Slide Show › It was the essence of his YSL, which he rechristened Saint Laurent, just as he rechristened Céline as Celine, dropping the accent. In both cases, Mr. Slimane was going back to an earlier incarnation of the logo, because — well, it was never entirely clear. Because he could. It sold very well for YSL. Celine's owners are probably assuming it will do the same for them. If they have to sacrifice all that the brand used to stand for in the process, so be it. It's fashion! Things change. Except not Mr. Slimane. Generally, when designers hop from heritage house to heritage house they make some nod to that heritage. Celine's has been fuzzier than most, granted — it doesn't have the same logo totems or design iconography. And when Mr. Slimane's predecessor, Phoebe Philo, arrived, she, too, swept away what had been before. Remember that? Didn't think so. It wasn't much, which was why she could. But she gave Celine an identity that for women meant a great deal, because it was clearly for them, not an image of them caught in a black and white photo of back alleys and nightclubs and the damage done after dusk. And it does beg the question: Why not just give Mr. Slimane a brand under his own name? That's effectively what's happened here. Why not just call it what it is? Why hedge your bets with a pseudonym? For a while, it was possible to hold out hope that Mr. Slimane might have lived up to all the hype around his reputation. That instead of repeating himself, he really would have been able to evolve his sense of form into something new; something that spoke more generously to those with multidimensional lives. It's rare for a designer to be able to change how people use dress to express themselves more than once in their career — Yves Saint Laurent (the man) did it, but he was an outlier. It turns out Mr. Slimane isn't. He had his moment. It mattered. Now he's just reliving it. Will the rest of us want to, also? The whippetlike suiting, which will be available equally for women as well as men (though the treatment does not apply to dresses): yes. But the pouty, infantilizing rest of it? The lack of diversity of any kind? No, thank you. Two years ago when Mr. Slimane departed fashion, the world was a different place. Women were different. Hell, they were different a few days ago. They have moved on. But he has not. And it meant that, despite an audience crammed with rock's hipster elite, the lyrics that most came to mind were Mamma Mia! Here we go again."
News,2018-09-29,"Sometimes the most important economic events announce themselves with huge front-page headlines, stock market collapses and frantic intervention by government officials.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/upshot/mini-recession-2016-little-known-big-impact.html,2840," Sometimes the most important economic events announce themselves with huge front-page headlines, stock market collapses and frantic intervention by government officials. Other times, a hard-to-explain confluence of forces has enormous economic implications, yet comes and goes without most people even being aware of it. In 2015 and 2016, the United States experienced the second type of event. There was a sharp slowdown in business investment, caused by an interrelated weakening in emerging markets, a drop in the price of oil and other commodities, and a run-up in the value of the dollar. The pain was confined mostly to the energy and agricultural sectors and to the portions of the manufacturing economy that supply them with equipment. Overall economic growth slowed but remained in positive territory. The national unemployment rate kept falling. Anyone who didn't work in energy, agriculture or manufacturing could be forgiven for not noticing it at all. Yet understanding this slump — think of it as a mini-recession — is important in many ways.  It helps explain the economic growth spurt of the last two years. The end of the mini-recession in the spring of 2016 created a capital spending rebound that began in mid-2016, and it has contributed to speedier growth since. Oil prices have reached four-year highs, a major factor in a surge in business investment this year. It helps explain some of the economic discontent evident in manufacturing-heavy areas during the 2016 elections. It offers warnings for where the next downturn might come from, and shows how important it is for policymakers to remain watchful and flexible about unpredictable shifts in the global economy. Most important, the mini-recession of 2015-16 offers a cautionary tale for any policymaker who might want to think of the United States as an economic island. The episode is stark evidence of the risk the Trump administration faces in threatening economic damage to negotiate leverage with other nations on trade and security. What happens overseas can return to American shores faster and more powerfully than once seemed possible. The mini-recession defies neatness. It's a story of spillovers and feedback loops and unintended consequences. But here's a summary: In 2015, Chinese leaders were concerned that their economy was experiencing a credit bubble, and they began imposing policies to restrain growth. These worked too well and caused a steep slowdown. That in turn caused troubles in other emerging nations for whom China was a major customer. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve, finally growing confident that the United States economy was returning to health, made plans to end its era of ultra-easy monetary policy. As the Fed moved toward tighter money, its counterparts at the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were going in the opposite direction. The prospect of higher interest rates in the United States and lower rates in the eurozone and Japan fueled a steep rise in the value of the dollar on global currency markets. That in turn made China's problems worse. China had long pegged the value of its currency to the dollar, so a stronger dollar was also making Chinese companies less competitive globally. When China attempted to reduce this burden by loosening the peg in August 2015, it faced capital outflows, making the economic situation worse. Moreover, across major emerging markets, many companies and banks had borrowed money in dollars, so a stronger dollar made their debt burdens more onerous. Put it all together, and when the Fed moved toward raising interest rates — as it eventually did in December 2015 — it was essentially making financial conditions tighter and therefore slowing growth across big swaths of the world. The slowdown across emerging markets, in turn, meant less demand for oil and many other commodities. That helped cause their prices to fall. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell to under $30 in February 2016 from around $106 in June 2014. The drops in the prices of metals like copper and aluminum, and agricultural products like corn and soybeans, were also steep. That only heightened the economic pain for the many emerging economies that are major commodity producers, such as Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia. Given falling prices and high debt loads among energy producers in the United States, the markets for stocks and riskier corporate bonds came under stress, especially in early 2016. That generated losses for investors and fears about the overall stability of the financial system. Each of these forces has connections to the others. It wasn't one problem, but an intersection of a bunch of them. That made it devilishly hard to diagnose, let alone to fix, even for the people whose job was to do just that. When Federal Reserve officials meet eight times a year to set interest rate policy, their job, assigned by Congress, is to figure out what is best for the United States economy. Their job isn't to set a policy that will be best for China or Brazil or Indonesia. Entering 2015, things were looking pretty good for the United States. Inflation was below the 2 percent level the Fed aims for, but the traditional economic models on which the central bankers had long relied predicted that it would start to rise thanks to a rapidly falling unemployment rate. Even when prices for oil and other commodities started falling in the middle of the year, the Fed's models viewed it as a positive for the overall economy. Sure, some oil drillers and farmers might experience lower incomes, but consumers everywhere would enjoy cheaper gasoline and grocery bills. Although officials spent a lot of time monitoring the global economy, the fact remained that the United States wasn't as dependent on exports as many smaller countries. The 2008 financial crisis had shown how the American and European banking systems were deeply intertwined, but the same couldn't be said of the ties with Chinese banks. In other words, through the summer of 2015 it sure looked to many Fed officials as if the sound move was to start raising interest rates. At the Treasury Department, which is responsible for the United States' currency policies, it seemed well into 2015 that the strengthening dollar was mostly benign. ""There was a sense that the U.S. was doing well and the rest of the world was not doing very well,"" said Nathan Sheets, a Treasury under secretary at the time and now chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income. ""It was driven by strong U.S. fundamentals."" But in late summer 2015, financial markets started to react more violently to the feedback loop of global currencies and commodities. It started to seem as if some of the old rules of thumb — about how a rising dollar or falling oil prices might affect the economy — might not apply. Perhaps the economics models used by forecasters had become outdated, failing to fully account for the ways surging energy production had become more intertwined with the manufacturing sector and the financial markets. ""These things were all interconnected in different ways, and they all cycled back on the same industries and parts of the economy,"" said Jay Shambaugh, a member of the Obama White House Council of Economic Advisers at the time. Still, distilling that complex story into crisp memos for senior officials was no easy task. ""You have to make memos short and to the point in the White House, and it was hard to say what exactly we thought was happening,"" he said. Behind closed doors at the Fed, officials started debating whether this outburst of volatility in markets really posed a risk to the overall economy. Should they stick to their plans to raise interest rates steadily, or slow down? Over two days in October, the debate played out publicly. Stan Fischer, the vice chairman of the Fed, was reluctant to adjust the planned rate increases, not wishing to let swings in financial markets dictate policy. ""We do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path for policy,"" he said in a speech in Lima, Peru, on Oct. 11, 2015. Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor who had worked on international issues at the Treasury, was quite a bit more worried. ""There is a risk that the intensification of international cross currents could weigh more heavily on U.S. demand directly, or that the anticipation of a sharper divergence in U.S. policy could impose restraint through additional tightening of financial conditions,"" she said on Oct. 12 in Washington. Ms. Brainard was right. The vicious circle of a stronger dollar, weaker emerging market growth and lower commodity prices caused spending on certain types of capital goods to plummet starting in mid-2015. Spending on agricultural machinery in 2016 fell 38 percent from 2014 levels; for petroleum and natural gas structures — think oil drilling rigs — the number was down a whopping 60 percent. The oil and gas exploration boom tied to fracking technology came to a halt with energy prices at rock-bottom levels, and with it sales of equipment tied to that boom.  With the fall in domestic capital investment in those industries and with weakness overseas, companies in related industries took it on the chin. Caterpillar, the maker of heavy equipment, had 30 percent lower revenue in 2016 than 2014. In large segments of the economy, by contrast, it was business as usual. Business spending on investments like computers and office buildings kept rising, as did consumer spending. Still, the industrial sector downturn was powerful enough to turn a strong expansion into a weak one. Overall growth fell to 1.3 percent in the four quarters ended in mid-2016, from 3.4 percent in the preceding year. The national economy kept adding jobs. But Harris County, Tex., which encompasses energy-centric Houston and its near suburbs, shed 0.8 percent of its jobs in that span. In Peoria, Ill., hometown of Caterpillar, employment fell 3.2 percent. In effect, this was a localized recession — severe in certain places, but concentrated enough that it did not throw the overall United States economy into contraction. In Williston, N.D., where the economy had been booming for years because of a surge in oil and natural gas drilling on the Bakken oil patch, businesses of all types closed or slashed wages. ""It varies week to week, but every week keeps getting worse,"" Marcus Jundt, owner of a restaurant, the Williston Brewing Company, told CNBC in March 2016. ""We don't know where the bottom is, but we're not there yet."" But it could have been worse. When Janet Yellen assumed leadership of the Federal Reserve in early 2014, she inherited an economy that had been expanding steadily for years, with a great deal of help from the Fed's interest rate policies. Deciding how and when to pull that support — when to raise interest rates, which had been near zero for more than six years — was set to be the defining choice of her tenure. In 2015, with signs that the United States economy was returning to health, she and her colleagues believed it was time to begin raising interest rates. She is a leading labor market scholar who spent a career studying, among other things, how a tight labor market can eventually feed through to inflation. In July of that year, with stirrings of the emerging markets disruption, the unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, not much above the level Fed officials believed was consistent with a fully healthy labor market. Then the turmoil of August began. Ms. Yellen elected not to raise rates in September, waiting for more evidence that the economy was truly on track and that the emerging market troubles wouldn't do too much damage to the domestic economy. But by December she judged that the situation had stabilized enough to raise rates. At the same time, the Fed revealed forecasts indicating that its senior officials expected to raise interest rates four more times in 2016. Within weeks, global markets were sending a message: Not so fast. The dollar kept strengthening, the price of commodities kept falling, and the Standard & Poor's 500 dropped about 9 percent over three weeks in late January and early February. Bond yields plummeted, suggesting that the United States was at risk of recession. In mid-February 2016, the financial leaders of the world's most powerful nations were set to convene in a Shanghai for the periodic G20 summit. With global markets in turmoil, the great question was: Can the officials rein in these forces? The official statement released by the participants in the summit contained multiple nods to the turbulence, acknowledging risks from ""volatile capital flows"" and falling commodity prices. But more important than any words was what followed in the following weeks. Two days after the summit, China lowered its reserve requirement on banks, essentially opening the spigot for more lending. In the months that followed, it would put in tighter controls on the movement of capital outside the country, and seek to tie the value of the yuan less closely to the dollar. Three weeks after the summit, the Fed had another policy meeting. Rather than raise interest rates further as had been envisioned in December, Fed officials declined to raise rates — and steeply reduced their expectations of how much further they would raise rates over the remainder of 2016. Together, these steps were enough to end the vicious cycle. The dollar stopped appreciating and started dropping. Oil prices bottomed out and began a recovery. In the United States, capital spending was growing again by the summer of 2016. Some analysts of financial markets have put a conspiratorial bent on the concerted action from the two sides of the Pacific, speculating that leaders had made a secret deal at the G20 meeting in February 2016. They call it the ""Shanghai Accord""— essentially, that the Fed would hold off on rate increases if the Chinese also took actions of their own. Ms. Yellen said it's not so. She said in an interview that there was an extensive exchange of views and information with the Chinese delegation in Shanghai, but that there were no promises or explicit agreements. ""I realize it looked to much of the world like some kind of secret handshake deal,"" she said. ""This wasn't a deal. This was the global economy and capital markets affecting the U.S. outlook, and the Fed being sensitive to that, taking that into account and its influencing policy appropriately."" The Fed, she said, did what it thought was best for the United States economy without knowing exactly what the Chinese would do. Mr. Sheets, the former Treasury official, also dismissed the idea of some secret agreement. ""It's just not how it works,"" he said. ""There were a lot of meetings. A lot of bilaterals and quadrilaterals. You meet with your counterparts and talk about the global economy and think about the challenges and what might be done. But there was nothing agreed behind closed doors that was not part of the formal statement."" Even if there was no formal secret agreement, the result — leaders of the world's two biggest economies squarely focused on the risks that the situation presented — turned out to be enough. The impact of the global commodity-currency spiral of 2015-16 is evident from a glance at the economic statistics. It is less so in the economic debates of 2018. First, while the Trump administration has claimed full credit for a surge in business investment, the bounce-back from the mini-recession is a major factor. White House economists have presented charts showing a surge starting in the fourth quarter of 2016, when the election took place. But that turnaround began in mid-2016 by most measures, not late 2016 as suggested by the White House's ""six quarter compound annual growth rate"" measure. Second, the mini-recession might well have affected some political attitudes during the 2016 election. While the economy was in pretty good shape for people in large cities on the coasts, 2016 was rough for a lot of people in local economies heavily reliant on drilling, mining, farming or making the machines that support those industries. A poll in October 2016 by an agriculture trade publication, Agri-Pulse, found that 86 percent of farmers were dissatisfied with the way things were going in the United States.  Third, economic policymakers need to display the flexibility to respond to incoming information, even when it doesn't fit their own forecasts or preconceptions. If Ms. Yellen had been more stubborn about sticking to the plan to keep raising rates through 2016 because of her training as a labor market economist, the result might well have been an actual recession. ""She's always learning,"" said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, ""and not so egotistical that she's wedded to one view of the world."" Finally, it shows the global economy is so interconnected that events in Shanghai or São Paulo can cause unpredictable effects in faraway places. In the last year, the Trump administration has been lobbing tariffs at China and other major economic partners to extract more advantageous terms for trade. But the mini-recession warns of the risk of ricochet. Like it or not, the complexity of our global connections means that policy can't just focus on the home front. In 2016, we learned that lesson the hard way, even if not everybody was paying attention."
News,2018-09-29,"Every weekday, shortly after 11 a.m., a line forms at the Broadway and 38th Street location of Sweetgreen, the eco-conscious salad chain.

",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/style/healthy-bowls-salad-waste.html,1679," Every weekday, shortly after 11 a.m., a line forms at the Broadway and 38th Street location of Sweetgreen, the eco-conscious salad chain. By noon, the line has usually tripled in size. It often takes more than 15 minutes to get to the front.  The scene is similar at the Chop't at 41st and Broadway, or the Dig Inn on West 38th, or the Just Salad one block south. In the heart of Midtown Manhattan, the evidence is hard to dismiss: Greens, once so unappetizing that parents all over the country had to beg and bribe their children to eat them, have never been hotter. (Almost as hot: their denser, younger cousin, grains.) At Sweetgreen, the appeal is partly ethical. The ingredients are sustainably farmed, sourced from trusted partners and served with transparency. There are vegan, gluten-free and ""warm bowl"" options. There are raw beets and organic carrots. There is local feta. It's enough to make the most wasteful among us feel good about consumerism. Is it any wonder that according to market research provided by Technomic, Sweetgreen is the fastest growing salad chain in the United States? The moral overtones extend even to the trash. As customers pay and head back toward their various workplaces, they pass an oft-overflowing garbage bin with a proud sign above it that says that all of the company's utensils, napkins, bowls and cups are plant-based, ""which means they go in the compost bin, along with any leftover food."" ""Nothing from inside Sweetgreen goes to the landfill,"" the sign declares further, virtuously. But that's far from the truth, though it's not the chain's fault. Matt Holtz, a salesman at Microsoft, is ""addicted"" to Sweetgreen, according to his co-worker, Michelle Munden, and goes almost every day. Mr. Holtz does not compost his disposable bowl once he is done eating, he said, though he ""will compost if the opportunity is available."" Zara Watson, a lawyer who eats at Sweetgreen three times a week, throws the waste from her healthful lunch directly in the trash because she does not have composting at her office. So does Sam Hockley, the managing director at the software company Meltwater, who is willing to eat a Sweetgreen bowl for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Even Scott Rogowsky, the host of HQ Trivia who last year put his continued employment in jeopardy when he expressed his preference for Sweetgreen, is unable to dispose of his salads responsibly at work, because composting is unavailable at the WeWork location where the trivia app is based.  Indeed, zero customers interviewed at Sweetgreen over several days said that they composted their bowls at their offices.  Salad is appealing not only because the food is healthy for us but because it's healthy for the world — a direct retort to the obviously very bad Styrofoam Filet-o-Fish containers that blighted many customers' youth.  But even as Sweetgreen and its wholesome brethren flourish, the compostable containers the chain puts such care into providing are, more often than not, going to a landfill. Picture the average salad obsessive: someone who eats right, exercises regularly, practices ""self-care"" … and throws his or her compostable waste, whether with guilt or casual oblivion, straight in the trash. Amber Jimenez, a fashion designer in line at Sweetgreen one day, said that she was new to what she called ""Sweetgreen Culture,"" to the point that she had made the mistake of standing in the line several times. That day, she had ordered online for the first time — when you do so, you can grab your pre-arranged salad straight from a shelf — and talked while waiting for her selection to arrive. ""I always see it, everyone's coming here,"" she said. ""It's the salad destination. The typical design lunch. You're just eating kale. But it's really good!"" Was she worried about the waste created by her food? ""I think about it like, I think about straws and stuff, but I don't think about it enough,"" she said. It's tempting to blame Sweetgreen for salad bowl waste. But the chain, perhaps more ""woke"" than those it feeds, takes compostable material very seriously. One of its founders, Nicolas Jammet, said in an interview that the packaging material was an ethical obligation: ""Because its part of our ethos,"" he said, ""we don't have a choice not to use it."" The manufacturer that provides its packaging has been certified by the Biodegradable Products Institute (meaning that it is actually compostable, unlike some products that advertise themselves as such). But the healthy choice represented by a lunch at Sweetgreen, or at other healthy salad chains, is circumscribed by a punishing workweek and the city's waste disposal system. Sweetgreen's sales in 2017 grew 44.4 percent from 2016, faster than competitors like Chop't and Tender Greens, and it expanded to 92 locations, from 81 the previous year. It has thrived on an office culture in which antiquated things like ""cafeterias"" and ""lunch hours"" are increasingly falling out of fashion. June Jo Lee, a food ethnographer who has traveled the country interviewing people about the way they eat, said that the working world had become so fast-paced, and involved so much complex collaboration, that people were eliminating their lunch hours, not only in the United States but increasingly, overseas. ""I remember seven years ago doing an interview with someone in Mexico City and they were saying the same thing,"" she said. ""There are all these people waiting behind his chair for his job and he can't take a traditional lunch hour."" Salad chains like Sweetgreen, Ms. Lee said, fit into that culture perfectly. Online ordering makes it a perfectly efficient lunch choice and the options available don't weigh its customers down like a burger would, allowing them to Just Keep Working. ""That's why I think Sweetgreen is taking off,"" she said. ""People don't want to feel heavy because they want to feel productive."" The trash cans, however, are getting very heavy indeed. Robert Buffolino, the general manager of American Recycling Management in Jamaica, Queens, said that it would be difficult to evaluate systematically whether the number of salad bowls in garbage cans had actually increased. But if you were asking him anecdotally? ""Yeah, sure, there's been an increase. Just by sight and sound, sure."" Moreover, ""most waste occurs at the consumer level,"" said Marc Bellemare, who directs the Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""Restaurants and grocery stores don't waste as much as consumers do."" He added, ""most of what gets wasted is not frozen pizza, it's not ice cream, it's produce, it's stuff that goes in salad. I suspect that the rise of those restaurants, my intuition is that those will mean the rise of food waste as well, because they sell this stuff to consumers, where the bulk of the losses tend to occur.""  Of course, one could also intuit that the rise of the chains cuts down on food waste, because the vegetables are coming pre-apportioned rather than piling up in bulk at home. But the container problem remains. Sweetgreen's most serious competitors — Chop't, Tender Greens and Saladworks — are still wedded to recyclable materials, though Chop't uses compostable fiber for its grain bowls. Another competitor, Just Salad, has more than 20 locations in New York and distributes reusable, washable plastic bowls to consumers. According to its director of marketing, Stephen Swartz, about a quarter of its customers use those bowls when they eat at the chain. ""Just Salad's reusable bowl program saves over 75,000 lbs. of plastic every year,"" he said in an email. ""As we like to say, 'every bowl fulfills a goal.'"" Dan Robbins, the director of purchasing at Tender Greens, said that the chain did not plan to move away from recyclable to-go containers ""until composting infrastructure is in place.""  In New York, despite a major effort by the city government over the past several years, that infrastructure is still being built. It is particularly difficult to compost from one's office, unless you work in a small business that makes a special push to do so. The city started collecting food waste five years ago, and only in the past two years has it begun to require some 2,100 of the city's more than 200,000 businesses to separate organic waste to be composted. This is complicated by the fact that in New York, commercial waste is not carted away by the city but by private companies, some of which offer composting options and some of which do not. (The New York Times building composts waste from its cafeteria but sends the remainder of its trash to a landfill, according to the building's facilities department.)  Eric Goldstein, the New York City environment director at the Natural Resources Defense Council said that it typically takes a city about a decade to transition to successful composting and that New York faces several challenges, one of which is simply educating people on how to compost in the first place. ""If you were to stop a person in the street, I don't know how many people could even tell you what composting really is,"" he said. ""We need a large-scale program to let New Yorkers know why this is important and how to participate in the program."" And of course, Mr. Goldstein said, composting itself is not the gold standard of eco-conscious lunch disposal. ""It's still best to use reusable things, even before composting and recycling,"" he said. ""But composting is an extremely valuable thing to do."" Consumers do not like to feel wasteful, and experts say that, if educated, they might change their ways. ""People have this really gut negative reaction to seeing packaging waste,"" said Ms. Lee, who sympathizes with their lack of options. ""There's guilt about what they're doing but it's also really inconvenient because it piles up."" The comments of Ms. Jimenez, the fashion designer who had recently started ordering ahead and skipping the wait at Sweetgreen, reflected that guilt. She said that she had even thought of putting together a petition to some of her favorite chains to ask that they address the issue. ""I'm like, 'ugh so much waste' and why can't there be a less wasteful way of doing it?"" she said, sounding pained. ""Why can't we focus on that as a priority?"""
News,2018-09-29,"DENVER — By nearly any measure, this city is booming. The unemployment rate is below 3 percent. There is so much construction that a local newspaper started a “crane watch” feature. Seemingly every week brings headlines about companies bringing high-paying jobs to the area.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/business/economy/home-prices-housing-market-slowdown.html,1814," DENVER — By nearly any measure, this city is booming. The unemployment rate is below 3 percent. There is so much construction that a local newspaper started a ""crane watch"" feature. Seemingly every week brings headlines about companies bringing high-paying jobs to the area. Yet, Denver's once-soaring housing market has run into turbulence. Sales and construction activity have slowed in recent months. Houses that would once have drawn a frenzy of offers are sitting on the market for days or weeks. Selling prices are rising more slowly, and asking prices are being slashed to attract buyers. Similar slowdowns have hit New York, Seattle and even San Francisco, cities that until recently ranked among the nation's hottest housing markets. The specifics vary, but economists, real estate agents and home builders say the core issue is the same: Home buyers are reaching a breaking point after years of breakneck price increases that far exceeded income gains. ""The local economy is still fantastic, all the fundamentals are there, but obviously wages are not keeping pace,"" said Steve Danyliw, a Denver realtor. ""As the market continues to move up, buyers are being pushed out."" Rachel Sandoval is one of them. An elementary schoolteacher in the Denver Public Schools, Ms. Sandoval earns about $50,000 a year, enough to afford a condominium or a modest house in most markets. But not in Denver, where the median sales price for all homes was $410,000 in August, and where even condos routinely top $300,000 — a price Ms. Sandoval calls ""not even close to feasible."" She said she was scoping out jobs in Texas, where houses are cheaper and pay is higher, and considering leaving teaching in search of a higher salary. For now, Ms. Sandoval, 41, is sharing a one-bathroom rental house with two roommates, a nurse and an adjunct professor. The three stick to a strict schedule to make sure they can all get to work on time. ""We are professionals, we have degrees,"" Ms. Sandoval said. ""This was not the plan."" Nationwide, sales of previously owned homes fell 1.5 percent in August from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Residential building permits were down 5.5 percent over the past year, according to the Department of Commerce. Many economists say the housing market may have turned into a drag on the gross domestic product. The recent slowdown, however, is unlikely to give would-be buyers like Ms. Sandoval much relief. Prices in Denver are still up 8 percent over the past year, according to the S&P Case-Shiller index. That's cool compared to the double-digit gains of a couple years ago, but well ahead of the 6 percent increase in average hourly earnings over the same period. Rising interest rates have also made buying homes more expensive. Few analysts expect an outright decline in home prices anytime soon. That's because, unlike the speculative bubble of the mid-2000s, the recent run-up in prices has been driven primarily by economic fundamentals: People are moving to Denver faster than developers can build places to live. The Denver region has added more than 300,000 residents since 2010, making it one of the country's fastest-growing areas. Introductory economics textbooks suggest that high prices should attract more supply or suppress demand — or both. Inventories of unsold homes have risen in Denver and other markets in recent months, and the real estate site Zillow found that price cuts have become more common. Over all, however, the housing market is not behaving as the textbooks say it should. Inventories remain low despite the recent increases, and new construction is slowing, not picking up. Part of the problem, local real estate agents say, is that the furious pace of price growth has essentially gummed up the market, making homeowners reluctant to sell for fear of being unable to find a new home. Rising interest rates are compounding the problem because would-be sellers do not want to give up their low interest rates, a phenomenon economists call the lock-in effect. Brant and Annie Wiedel spent more than a year trying to get a foothold in Denver's housing market — and they are reluctant to give it up. The couple estimate that they looked at 160 houses before finally closing on a three-bedroom ranch house in Lakewood, a suburb, three years ago. With two children and a third due in January, the Wiedels would like to trade up. With the rise in home prices some renovations, the house they bought for $350,000 could be worth more than $500,000. But the family borrowed at about 3.5 percent three years ago. Today, they would pay closer to 5 percent. ""Even if we just saw houses at the same price, we'd have to pay more"" every month, he said. Ultimately, the key to breaking the logjam is to build more homes. Downtown Denver is crawling with cranes, many of them erecting amenity-filled apartment complexes aimed at young professionals. A drive in almost any direction from downtown reveals freshly built subdivisions with names like Tallgrass, The Enclave and Green Gables Reserve. Most of those new homes, however, will list for more than $400,000. And hardly any builders are selling properties for under $300,000 without government subsidies. Even many home builders worry they are pricing themselves out of the market. ""I see the biggest threat to our business as the affordability challenge, that we are building houses that people can't afford,"" said Gene Myers, chief executive of Thrive Home Builders. The problem, Mr. Myers and other local builders say, is cost. The price of land, building permits and other fees can run close to $150,000 for a single-family lot — before construction. Some of the challenges are specific to Colorado. Quirks in state law, for example, make it easy for condominium buyers to collectively sue builders over construction defects, making developers reluctant to build condos. But other issues are common to many cities. Building materials have become more expensive, in part because of tariffs on lumber and other products that President Trump imposed this year. Labor costs are rising, too, especially for skilled trade workers. Restrictive zoning makes it hard to build denser developments that make cheaper homes profitable for builders. ""They're producing what they can produce,"" said Sam Khater, chief economist for Freddie Mac, the government housing-finance company. ""The problem is, it's uneconomic for them to produce affordable."" This big-city conundrum is spreading. People priced out of San Francisco moved to Seattle and Portland, driving up prices and displacing people who moved to Denver and Austin. Next on the list: Boise, Nashville and other cities offering some of the same attractions at lower prices. Sure enough, the online real estate site Redfin this spring found that Denver had joined Seattle and San Francisco as cities with a ""net outflow"" of users — that is, there were more people on the site looking to leave Denver than to move there. ""City after city is going to face this,"" said Glenn Kelman, Redfin's chief executive. ""At some point, the buyers step back and say, 'Enough is enough.'"" More people are moving to Denver than leaving it, but migration has tapered off in recent years. J. J. Ament, chief executive of Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, said he had seen no sign that rising home prices were making the region less attractive. Last month, VF Corporation, an apparel maker that owns brands like The North Face and Vans, announced it would move its headquarters to Denver from North Carolina, partly because of the area's reputation for outdoor activities. The state also offered $27 million in incentives. ""I wouldn't use the word 'crisis,'"" Mr. Ament said. ""The work force is still willing to move here."" Plenty of people in Denver do use the word ""crisis,"" however. A January report from Shift Research Lab, a local research group, concluded that years of under-building have left the region with a shortfall of tens of thousands of housing units. That shortfall could threaten Denver's growth, said Phyllis Resnick, a Colorado State University economist and one of the report's authors. The skilled workers moving to the area, who have been so important to attracting companies and jobs, want to be able to eat out at restaurants, drop off their dry cleaning and send their children to school, all of which require lower and middle income workers. If they cannot afford to live in the area, Ms. Resnick said, Denver will not retain its allure — and the economy will not keep growing. ""My concern is, at some point it sort of breaks because we can't house the folks that we need to fill out all the economic activity in the region,"" she said. ""I'm not convinced that in the near term it will correct itself just through market forces, unless that's through people moving out."" Local governments and charities are trying to address the problem. The Denver City Council last month voted to double, to $30 million per year, the city's affordable housing fund, which is used to build and preserve homes for low-income residents. Late last year, nonprofit groups announced they had raised $24 million to start the Elevation Community Land Trust, which will buy land to create permanently affordable housing. Another new program aims to help public schoolteachers come up with down payments. To have a big impact, economists say Denver and other cities have to build more homes affordable to middle-class families. That will require persuading communities accustomed to single-family homes to accept condos and townhomes. ""The only way to solve the riddle is through density,"" said Dave Lemnah, co-owner of Lokal Homes, a Denver builder. That's why he is building projects like the Villas at Wheatlands, a 94-unit development in Aurora, east of Denver. Each lot has three attached units arranged like a jigsaw puzzle. Lokal sells the homes for less than $400,000; some go for close to $300,000. One buyer, Angela Kirkland-Vandecar, an aesthetician and a single mother, has spent two years searching for a home she could afford on her roughly $50,000 income. When Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar began her search, she did not want to move to Aurora or to a condo. ""I've now done everything that in the beginning I said I was not going to do,"" she said. But Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar feels good about her decision. Her monthly mortgage payment will be less than her $1,900 monthly rent, and she is happy not to have a lawn to mow. Her daughters, 11 and 13, will have their own rooms, and she will no longer have to store food in the laundry room, as she did in the cramped apartment she had been renting. Walking through her nearly ready house recently, looking for defects, Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar opened a door in the kitchen and paused. A Lokal Homes worker asked if she had found a problem. She shook her head. ""I'm just enjoying my pantry,"" she said."

""City after city is going to face this,"" said Glenn Kelman, Redfin's chief executive. ""At some point, the buyers step back and say, 'Enough is enough.'"" More people are moving to Denver than leaving it, but migration has tapered off in recent years. J. J. Ament, chief executive of Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, said he had seen no sign that rising home prices were making the region less attractive. Last month, VF Corporation, an apparel maker that owns brands like The North Face and Vans, announced it would move its headquarters to Denver from North Carolina, partly because of the area's reputation for outdoor activities. The state also offered $27 million in incentives. ""I wouldn't use the word 'crisis,'"" Mr. Ament said. ""The work force is still willing to move here."" Plenty of people in Denver do use the word ""crisis,"" however. A January report from Shift Research Lab, a local research group, concluded that years of under-building have left the region with a shortfall of tens of thousands of housing units. That shortfall could threaten Denver's growth, said Phyllis Resnick, a Colorado State University economist and one of the report's authors. The skilled workers moving to the area, who have been so important to attracting companies and jobs, want to be able to eat out at restaurants, drop off their dry cleaning and send their children to school, all of which require lower and middle income workers. If they cannot afford to live in the area, Ms. Resnick said, Denver will not retain its allure — and the economy will not keep growing. ""My concern is, at some point it sort of breaks because we can't house the folks that we need to fill out all the economic activity in the region,"" she said. ""I'm not convinced that in the near term it will correct itself just through market forces, unless that's through people moving out."" Local governments and charities are trying to address the problem. The Denver City Council last month voted to double, to $30 million per year, the city's affordable housing fund, which is used to build and preserve homes for low-income residents. Late last year, nonprofit groups announced they had raised $24 million to start the Elevation Community Land Trust, which will buy land to create permanently affordable housing. Another new program aims to help public schoolteachers come up with down payments. To have a big impact, economists say Denver and other cities have to build more homes affordable to middle-class families. That will require persuading communities accustomed to single-family homes to accept condos and townhomes. ""The only way to solve the riddle is through density,"" said Dave Lemnah, co-owner of Lokal Homes, a Denver builder. That's why he is building projects like the Villas at Wheatlands, a 94-unit development in Aurora, east of Denver. Each lot has three attached units arranged like a jigsaw puzzle. Lokal sells the homes for less than $400,000; some go for close to $300,000. One buyer, Angela Kirkland-Vandecar, an aesthetician and a single mother, has spent two years searching for a home she could afford on her roughly $50,000 income. When Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar began her search, she did not want to move to Aurora or to a condo. ""I've now done everything that in the beginning I said I was not going to do,"" she said. But Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar feels good about her decision. Her monthly mortgage payment will be less than her $1,900 monthly rent, and she is happy not to have a lawn to mow. Her daughters, 11 and 13, will have their own rooms, and she will no longer have to store food in the laundry room, as she did in the cramped apartment she had been renting. Walking through her nearly ready house recently, looking for defects, Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar opened a door in the kitchen and paused. A Lokal Homes worker asked if she had found a problem. She shook her head. ""I'm just enjoying my pantry,"" she said."
News,2018-09-29,"This article was reported and written in a collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit  journalism organization.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/health/memorial-sloan-kettering-cancer-biotech-ethics.html,1373," This article was reported and written in a collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit journalism organization. A vice president of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has to turn over to the hospital nearly $1.4 million of a windfall stake in a biotech company, in light of a series of for-profit deals and industry conflicts at the cancer center that has forced it to re-examine its corporate relationships. The vice president, Dr. Gregory Raskin, oversees hospital ventures with for-profit companies. As compensation for representing the hospital on the biotech company's board, Dr. Raskin received stock options whose value soared when the start-up went public a little over a week ago. The move to hand over his stake is one of several steps now underway as the cancer center tries to contain a crisis that has already led to the resignation of its chief medical officer and a review of its conflict-of-interest policies. Several board members and some executives of the nonprofit institution have maintained close ties to the health and drug industries at a time when stunning cancer breakthroughs are generating excitement among investors and spawning a flurry of biotech start-ups. At other cancer centers and research institutions, employees are barred from accepting personal compensation when they represent their institution on corporate boards. But Memorial Sloan Kettering had no such prohibition until now. Dr. Raskin has been involved with the start-up, Y-mAbs Therapeutics, since 2015 when he signed off on the deal with Memorial Sloan Kettering, where the company's experimental treatments for children with cancer have been developed. His vested stock options are worth about $675,000, at least on paper. Stock options that will vest in the future are worth about $616,000 more. In addition, shares he had personally purchased earlier at a discounted price are now worth about $106,000 more than he paid for them. After The New York Times and ProPublica asked about Dr. Raskin's compensation, Memorial Sloan Kettering said it would change its policy so that he and other employees in similar roles would not profit personally from such arrangements, and that all proceeds would revert to the hospital and its research. The hospital itself has an equity stake in the company of 8.45 percent, which is worth $73 million. On Friday, the Manhattan-based cancer center issued a memo to thousands of employees, announcing that it would restrict some interactions with for-profit companies. It said it was imposing a moratorium on board members investing in or holding board positions in start-ups that originated with Memorial Sloan Kettering. For now, the moratorium on board investments only applies to new deals, the hospital said. It would not affect  the exclusive deal the hospital made with an artificial intelligence company, Paige.AI, to license digital images of 25 million tissue slides. Three insiders, including a member of Memorial Sloan Kettering's executive board, were company co-founders, and three other board members were investors. Staff turmoil over the deal caused Dr. David Klimstra, the chairman of the pathology department, to announce that he would divest his equity stake in Paige.AI. Memorial Sloan Kettering said in the memo, ""We have determined that when profits emerge through the monetization of our research, financial payments to M.S.K.-designated board members should be used for the benefit of the institution."" The proposed policies stopped short of barring hospital executives from receiving compensation for their work on outside boards, although officials have said that is a move they are considering. Dr. Craig B. Thompson, the cancer center's chief executive, sits on the board of the drug maker Merck. Dr. José Baselga, the chief medical officer who resigned under fire this month after an article in The Times and ProPublica about his undisclosed industry ties, sat on the board of the drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb and Varian Medical Systems, a manufacturer of radiation equipment. He resigned both positions after he stepped down from his role at the hospital. In an email, Dr. Raskin said that all of his compensation for work with Y-mAbs ""is being committed to Memorial Sloan Kettering and the amazing work we do."" He said he ""couldn't be prouder of the work we've accomplished at Y-mAbs in extending children's lives. I am grateful that I have the opportunity to lend my expertise in biotech business development and licensing intellectual property to bring M.S.K.'s unique and critical discoveries to cancer patients."" Christine Hickey, a spokeswoman for Memorial Sloan Kettering, said Dr. Raskin brought the matter to hospital leadership on Sept. 21, the same day that Y-mAbs began trading publicly and a day after the article about Paige.AI was published online. She said he had fully disclosed his ties to the company, as required by the hospital. Before joining Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2012, Dr. Raskin was vice president of the venture capital arm of AllianceBernstein, focusing on biotechnology. He now leads the cancer center's Office of Technology Development. Hospitals and universities have long assisted researchers with tasks like registering patents, but Dr. Raskin's field — known as technology transfer — has expanded in recent years. Technology transfer offices have become increasingly involved in helping to set up companies, said Stephen Susalka, the chief executive of the Association of University Technology Managers. More than 1,000 start-ups originated at universities, hospitals or research institutions in 2017, according to his group, up from about 550 in 2007. Research institutions have varying policies when it comes to allowing employees to represent them on the boards of companies. Some, like the Cleveland Clinic and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, permit employees to represent the hospital on company boards, while others, like the University of Utah, do not. The Cleveland Clinic said it prohibits employees from personally profiting when they are representing the interests of the institution. A spokeswoman for MD Anderson said that its head of technology transfer serves on one corporate board as a hospital representative, but that position is uncompensated. Karin Immergluck, the executive director of the Office of Technology Licensing at Stanford University, said she would not serve on a company board in her position overseeing the commercialization of research discoveries at Stanford. In the wake of deals that gave insiders financial stakes in companies, hospital executives declared a moratorium on some practices involving seats on boards of start-ups and personal investments. ""It looks very conflicted, and I would think people from the outside might ask who you are representing,"" the nonprofit institution or the for-profit company, she said. Y-mAbs, based in New York, was formed around immunotherapy treatments developed by the lab of Dr. Nai-Kong V. Cheung, a pediatric oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering. As part of a commercialization agreement, he received a stake worth $64.5 million on Friday. Researchers whose discoveries lead to new drugs are not covered by the new policy. With help from those promising therapies, the company's market value has skyrocketed to nearly $867 million. ""Memorial Sloan Kettering couldn't be prouder of the work of our colleagues — who persisted over a 20-year period — to develop antibodies against different forms of advanced neuroblastoma; they are literally saving children's lives,"" Ms. Hickey said. Y-mAbs is hoping to win approval for its two lead products, naxitamab and omburtamab, to treat neuroblastoma and other cancers. Both drugs were given a breakthrough designation by the Food and Drug Administration, which means the agency will give them an expedited review because there is evidence they could be a substantial improvement over existing treatments. ""These drugs saved my daughter,"" the company's founder and president, Thomas Gad, said in an email. In August 2015, Dr. Raskin signed off on the licensing deal between Memorial Sloan Kettering and Y-mAbs. Within weeks, he had taken a seat on the Y-mAbs board. After that, he had to recuse himself from hospital decisions about the company and was not allowed to sign agreements between Memorial Sloan Kettering and the company, officials said. The company said Dr. Raskin received the same package of compensation as others on the nine-member board who are not company executives. Between 2015 and 2017, Dr. Raskin also served on the board of another company, Sellas Life Sciences Group, that was created to commercialize a cancer vaccine developed at the hospital. Memorial Sloan Kettering said he was not serving as the hospital's official designee, and Dr. Raskin received $30,000 for his service in 2017, according to financial filings. He will now give that to the hospital to benefit research, Memorial Sloan Kettering said."
News,2018-09-29,"ST.-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France — There were no more sweeps in the September sunshine and Phil Mickelson did not get to play any golf at all.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/sports/golf/ryder-cup-golf.html,1274," ST.-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France — There were no more sweeps in the September sunshine and Phil Mickelson did not get to play any golf at all. But the most significant trend remained unchanged at the Ryder Cup on Saturday, as Europe continued to build its lead over the United States with Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood leading the construction project. Ahead by two points after Friday's matches, Europe now leads by 10-6 heading into the decisive singles matches on Sunday as it attempts to win back the Cup, golf's premier team trophy. After sweeping the final session on Friday, Europe dominated the morning four-ball session on Saturday, winning three of the four matches with the only American victory coming from their most successful team of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas in the final match. The Americans and Europeans then split the four alternate-shot matches in the afternoon, which left the four-point gap between the teams unchanged heading into Sunday's 12 singles matches. ""When you look at those 12 American names, it's a strong lineup,"" the European captain Thomas Bjorn said. ""It can go either way, but we're really, really, really happy with how it's gone these first two days."" For now, Bjorn, while looking like a man in need of a good night's rest, has done a fine job of keeping his players fresh and focused on the present. He also has succeeded at setting up the rolling Albatros course (and its thick rough) to suit Europe's strengths and at choosing his pairings and his 12-man lineup wisely. After two days, Bjorn's four captain's picks have combined for six victories. The four picks of the United States captain, Jim Furyk, have only one. But while Bjorn can be delighted with the results so far against a powerhouse American team that has the best combined world ranking of any American team in history, he also knows that a 10-6 lead is not impregnable. In 1999, the Europeans lost the Cup after holding at 10-6 edge heading into the final day at the Country Club in Brookline, Mass. In 2012, the Americans blew a 10-6 lead at home at Medinah Country Club near Chicago. ""History will show me and everybody on the team that this is not over,"" Bjorn said. ""You go full-bore tomorrow."" Furyk, unlike Bjorn, played in both 1999 and 2012, losing one of the critical singles matches to Sergio García at Medinah. ""It sure sucked being on the other side, I will say that,"" Furyk said of 2012. ""That was one of the worst days of my career."" Generating early momentum on the final day was the key to both of those comebacks, which ended with 14½-to-13½ victories. The Americans, who won the last Ryder Cup in 2016, only need 14 total points this time to retain the trophy, and with a quick start in mind Furyk has attempted to front load his singles lineup with his in-form players. ""We're trying to make some magic tomorrow,"" said Furyk, who has made a point of speaking with Ben Crenshaw, the emotive captain of the U.S. team in 1999. Crenshaw famously predicted on the eve of the comeback that he had ""a feeling"" his team would rally. Justin Thomas, a Ryder Cup rookie who has not played like one in winning three matches this week with Spieth, will go out first on Sunday and face Rory McIlroy. Brooks Koepka, the Floridian who won two majors this year, will go second against Paul Casey. Then Webb Simpson will face Justin Rose, one of the European leaders, followed by Tiger Woods against the Spaniard Jon Rahm. ""I think if we can go out and get two, three points out of the first two, three matches, it starts to be a pretty quiet, uneasy feeling around here,"" Spieth said. ""And that will obviously be the goal."" It has been anything but quiet on the rolling Albatros Course at Le Golf National. Though there were questions about the level of home support Europe's team could expect with France hosting a Ryder Cup for the first time, the fans, many of them British, have turned up in force and in full voice. It has been a more hostile European crowd than in the past, with the spectators regularly booing American miscues and missed putts. But then this is a new Ryder Cup market in a country where golf is not a mainstream spectator sport. Though the French have no players of their own taking part, the French spectators have been able to repurpose their national soccer team chant: ""Allez Les Bleus!"" (Go Blues). The European team's color is blue as well, and there has been plenty of blue on the scoreboards here. Molinari and Fleetwood have been the most irresistible force, becoming the first European pairing to win all four of its matches in a Ryder Cup. ""That pairing came out of long conversations with the two of them and a relationship they built with each other over a long time,"" Bjorn said. ""They wanted to do this and when they kind of both said that they were really keen on that pairing, I started looking at facts and figures and everything that was built around them. Speaking to the stats guys and the vice captains, there was never any red flags with the two of them, so I thought, O.K., we'll give it a go."" Neither Molinari nor Fleetwood had won a match in the Cup before this year. Fleetwood is a rookie, and Molinari was 0-4-2 in two previous appearances. But he has taken his precision game to a new level in 2018, winning his first major at the British Open at Carnoustie while playing in the same final-round pairing with Woods. Molinari has continued to torment Woods at Le Golf National, beating him three times in two days with plenty of help from the more demonstrative Fleetwood. Woods arrived in France on a high after winning his first tour title in five years, but he has spent much of his time on the course wincing, grimacing and trying to make the best of difficult lies and long putts. There has been speculation by former Ryder Cup captains like Nick Faldo that Woods is suffering from back pain or some other ailment, noting changes in his swing. Furyk said he was not aware of any such issue, but he has not ruled out physical or psychological fatigue. ""I think he might be emotionally a little bit tired,"" Furyk said. ""You find a way in a Ryder Cup to gain some energy and some adrenaline, and you work hard. I know he's going to be fit and ready to go tomorrow."" Molinari and Fleetwood defeated Woods and Patrick Reed, 4 and 3, on Saturday morning as Reed, one of the mainstays of the last two American Ryder Cup teams, continued to struggle from tee to green. Furyk chose to rest Reed in the afternoon on Saturday and to not use the 48-year-old Mickelson in either session on Saturday. But Woods, at age 42, was back out there with the Ryder Cup rookie Bryson DeChambeau for the foursomes. This time, Molinari and Fleetwood prevailed again, 5 and 4, combining to make four birdies and not one bogey in the 14 holes they had to play. ""It won't be easy tomorrow to be separated,"" Molinari said of Fleetwood. Woods, whose overall Ryder Cup record is now 13-20-3, won't have to deal with either of them on Sunday. Fleetwood will face Tony Finau in singles; Molinari will face Mickelson. But the wind, which has been blowing all week at Le Golf National, is still at Europe's back."

It was one of many swastikas hidden throughout the palace, relics of the days when it was occupied by the Nazis. My reaction was not one of horror or dismay, but of triumph. The swastikas were not only a reminder of the evil they represented — they were also a reminder of the Allies' destruction of that bestial regime. I've been thinking of those swastikas lately, as I contemplate what to make of the surging illiberal tide on both sides of the Atlantic.  Some see today's threats to the liberal order and feel despair. It's not just the Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin axis, but also their equivalents in Hungary, Turkey, Poland, Italy, Austria and elsewhere.  But I am hopeful. I believe that democracy will beat back the illiberal wave, and that President Trump will be one of the first to go. My faith is based on the lessons of history. The liberal project has faced down much worse: the First World War, the Depression, World War II, the Cold War. And democracy overcame them all. Today, Mr. Trump, like Mr. Putin, Viktor Orban of Hungary and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, has presided over a head-on attack on the five pillars of the liberal project — its personal, political, media, market and rule-of-law freedoms. His racial invectives assault personal equality. His criminalization of his opponents transgresses political norms. His threats against the news media (including even search engines) offend First Amendment values. His tariffs, crony capitalism and self-dealing make a mockery of free enterprise. And his constant assaults on his own Department of Justice and its personnel flout the rule of law. But if you've studied the power of democracy to topple those far more formidable than Mr. Trump, it will come as no surprise that the pushback has been ferocious.  Supermajorities of Americans are repelled by Mr. Trump's personal attacks on a few of us, leaving him with approval ratings deep underwater. Politically, those numbers augur ill for his party in the midterms. This could mean that at least one house of Congress will have the will to use its subpoena power. The media has fought back with devastating effect, and Mr. Trump's tariffs and other distortions of free markets are being met with an outcry from the likes of even the Koch brothers.  But it is the rule of law that will have the most impact. August saw the simultaneous conviction of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, and the guilty plea of Michael Cohen, his longtime lawyer and fixer, who identified Mr. Trump as a co-conspirator. That was followed by the news that two other close Trump associates had entered immunity agreements to testify about the hush money payments at issue. It seems unlikely that prosecutors went to that trouble only to pursue Mr. Cohen, against whom there was already overwhelming evidence. The next shoe to drop could be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there now is very substantial evidence in the public record. Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections. Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go again before the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers. That is a lot of ifs, and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable — nor that of his equivalents in Europe. There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be.  In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich. We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that ensued. The course of history pivots around such inflection points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or delayed. Americans face several of these inflection points now.  What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation? Rosenstein has been in hot water ever since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his being unfit for office. (Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's account is inaccurate.)  How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair — or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony? And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable? If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter. But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague. My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home. She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me off to light Sabbath candles on that table bearing the swastika. With that as my heritage, how can I not be an optimist about our future?

To not be political is to be political.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/opinion/sunday/christians-politics-belief.html,951," What should the role of Christians in politics be? More people than ever are asking that question. Christians cannot pretend they can transcend politics and simply ""preach the Gospel."" Those who avoid all political discussions and engagement are essentially casting a vote for the social status quo. American churches in the early 19th century that did not speak out against slavery because that was what we would now call ""getting political"" were actually supporting slavery by doing so. To not be political is to be political. The Bible shows believers as holding important posts in pagan governments — think of Joseph and Daniel in the Old Testament. Christians should be involved politically as a way of loving our neighbors, whether they believe as we do or not. To work for better public schools or for a justice system not weighted against the poor or to end racial segregation requires political engagement. Christians have done these things in the past and should continue to do so. Nevertheless, while believers can register under a party affiliation and be active in politics, they should not identify the Christian church or faith with a political party as the only Christian one. There are a number of reasons to insist on this. One is that it gives those considering the Christian faith the strong impression that to be converted, they need not only to believe in Jesus but also to become members of the (fill in the blank) Party. It confirms what many skeptics want to believe about religion — that it is merely one more voting bloc aiming for power. Another reason not to align the Christian faith with one party is that most political positions are not matters of biblical command but of practical wisdom. This does not mean that the church can never speak on social, economic and political realities, because the Bible often does. Racism is a sin, violating the second of the two great commandments of Jesus, to ""love your neighbor."" The biblical commands to lift up the poor and to defend the rights of the oppressed are moral imperatives for believers. For individual Christians to speak out against egregious violations of these moral requirements is not optional. However, there are many possible ways to help the poor. Should we shrink government and let private capital markets allocate resources, or should we expand the government and give the state more of the power to redistribute wealth? Or is the right path one of the many possibilities in between? The Bible does not give exact answers to these questions for every time, place and culture. I know of a man from Mississippi who was a conservative Republican and a traditional Presbyterian. He visited the Scottish Highlands and found the churches there as strict and as orthodox as he had hoped. No one so much as turned on a television on a Sunday. Everyone memorized catechisms and Scripture. But one day he discovered that the Scottish Christian friends he admired were (in his view) socialists. Their understanding of government economic policy and the state's responsibilities was by his lights very left-wing, yet also grounded in their Christian convictions. He returned to the United States not more politically liberal but, in his words, ""humbled and chastened."" He realized that thoughtful Christians, all trying to obey God's call, could reasonably appear at different places on the political spectrum, with loyalties to different political strategies. Another reason Christians these days cannot allow the church to be fully identified with any particular party is the problem of what the British ethicist James Mumford calls ""package-deal ethics."" Increasingly, political parties insist that you cannot work on one issue with them if you don't embrace all of their approved positions. This emphasis on package deals puts pressure on Christians in politics. For example, following both the Bible and the early church, Christians should be committed to racial justice and the poor, but also to the understanding that sex is only for marriage and for nurturing family. One of those views seems liberal and the other looks oppressively conservative. The historical Christian positions on social issues do not fit into contemporary political alignments. So Christians are pushed toward two main options. One is to withdraw and try to be apolitical. The second is to assimilate and fully adopt one party's whole package in order to have your place at the table. Neither of these options is valid. In the Good Samaritan parable told in the Gospel of Luke, Jesus points us to a man risking his life to give material help to someone of a different race and religion. Jesus forbids us to withhold help from our neighbors, and this will inevitably require that we participate in political processes. If we experience exclusion and even persecution for doing so, we are assured that God is with us (Matthew 5:10-11) and that some will still see our ""good deeds and glorify God"" (1 Peter 2:11-12). If we are only offensive or only attractive to the world and not both, we can be sure we are failing to live as we ought. The Gospel gives us the resources to love people who reject both our beliefs and us personally. Christians should think of how God rescued them. He did it not by taking power but by coming to earth, losing glory and power, serving and dying on a cross. How did Jesus save? Not with a sword but with nails in his hands.

During her second week there, a house guest arrived to visit family and he and Ms. Jow eventually struck up a conversation. When she told him she had broken up with a musician in London, he quickly brought up another musician, his friend Wade Michael, who had just moved to Brooklyn from his native Wisconsin after the breakup of his rock band, American Standard. Mr. Michael, he said, had previously lived in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and had come to New York a bit dazed and confused, hoping to give his music ""one last try."" When he asked Ms. Jow if she wanted to join him and Mr. Michael for lunch, she politely declined. ""I wasn't interested in being set up,"" she said. She did, however, send Mr. Michael an email to apologize for turning down the invite. ""I just wanted to be courteous,"" she said. But when she noticed how ""surprisingly proper and charismatic"" Mr. Michael's email responses were, she became intrigued, so she reached out and they arranged to meet for coffee. ""She was very striking with beautiful blonde hair,"" Mr. Michael said. ""Just the way she talked, and the things she talked about, like the world she was a part of in London, those were things that growing up in the Midwest I was very interested in, but never fully understood."" They began spending time together and became an item in March 2012, after a heart-to-heart talk at a Brooklyn bar where Ms. Jow discussed the emotional pain of her breakup in London. That conversation was followed by a walk through a nearby park that overlooked the East River, where they shared their first kiss. Read more.

briefing,2018-09-30,"Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/briefing/brett-kavanaugh-tsunami-elon-musk.html,1166," Here are the week's top stories, and a look ahead. 1. All-out partisan war.  A final Senate vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh, above, to the Supreme Court was delayed by a week, after a day of extraordinary testimony, acrimony across the aisle and last-minute debate. On Thursday, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford held Washington and the country rapt with a wrenching account of a teenage sexual assault, saying she was ""100 percent"" certain that a 17-year-old Brett Kavanaugh was the attacker. He delivered a furious defense that restored Republican commitment to his confirmation. Here's our fact-check of his assertions. A frenetic, last-minute push persuaded one Republican senator, Jeff Flake of Arizona, to support an F.B.I. investigation into Dr. Blasey's allegations, keeping the judge's fate in limbo. Here's how the F.B.I. will proceed. The delay in the vote could help either party in the midterms, potentially galvanizing conservatives, but also possibly causing a backlash among women and independent voters. Some wonder if the institution of the Supreme Court has already suffered permanent harm. ____ 2. A powerful earthquake and 16-foot tsunami killed more than 800 people on the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday night, the authorities there said. Hundreds of others were injured. Officials fear the death toll will rise, as rescuers scrambled to reach the worst-hit areas like the city of Palu, above. Have you been keeping up with the headlines? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. And here's the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles. ____ 3. Prime ministers, presidents and diplomats from around the world gathered in New York for the annual session of the U.N. General Assembly. The speeches wrap up on Monday. President Trump loomed large at the gathering, accusing China of election interference and antagonizing Canada over trade. His address, on familiar ""American First"" themes, rejected ""the very premise of the U.N.,"" a former State Department official said. And one line — a boast — drew laughs. He gave an 83-minute news conference afterward. Topics: Whether he would fire his deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, with whom he'll meet this week; his support for his Supreme Court nominee; and that laughter (""They were laughing with me""). Looking ahead: Monday is the anniversary of the Las Vegas mass shooting. The first lady, Melania Trump, begins a weeklong trip through Africa, and the first of this year's Nobel Prize winners will be announced. The Peace Prize winner will be named on Friday. ____ 4. ""The day has come. The time has come.""  A judge in Pennsylvania sentenced Bill Cosby to up to 10 years in jail for sexual assault, a term he began serving immediately. It was the end of a remarkable downfall, from ""America's dad"" to an 81-year-old convicted sex offender. Women across the country celebrated the first high-profile conviction of the #MeToo era. Contrasts to the Kavanaugh hearings were abundant, but one thing is clear: Both men were called to account in a way unimaginable just a few years ago. ____ 5. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, was sued by federal regulators who accused him of committing fraud with a tweet about ""funding secured"" to take his electric carmaker private. Tesla's stock dropped about 14 percent lower Friday. In its lawsuit, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Mr. Musk should be barred from serving as the head of publicly traded companies — a swipe against the market's embrace of charismatic executives. On Saturday, the S.E.C. announced a deal to resolve the case, in which Mr. Musk must step aside as chairman for three years and pay a $20 million fine. ____ 6. Facebook said hackers had exposed the personal information of nearly 50 million users in a breach discovered this week. The top executives, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, were among those users, according to two people who also pinpointed software flaws as the hackers' access points. The company said the unidentified culprits aimed at collecting information including users' names, gender and hometowns. Here are three steps you can take to secure your own account. Adding to the upheaval: the co-founders of the photo-sharing app Instagram, one of Facebook's most prized possessions, resigned. ____ 7. The housing boom is winding down. After years of price increases that outpaced income gains, middle-class families can no longer afford to buy homes in cities like Denver, Seattle and New York. ""We are professionals, we have degrees,"" said a Denver public school teacher who shares a rented house with a nurse and an adjunct professor. ""This was not the plan."" Our economics correspondent, Neil Irwin, looked at the mini-recession in 2015-6 to understand the economic growth spurt of the last two years — and extract warnings of where the next downturn might come from. Above, oil fields in North Dakota. ____ 8. ""Saturday Night Live"" returned for its 44th season, bringing in Matt Damon, above, to play Judge Brett Kavanaugh in a recreation of Thursday's senate hearings. Kanye West was the musical guest, and though he gave three performances, all of the attention was on his post-show remarks about politics and racism, which he made while wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat. ____ 9. In sports:  Follow our live coverage of N.F.L. Week 4 here. The National Hockey League season starts Wednesday. Montreal's Canadiens and Toronto's Maple Leafs will face off, along with the Boston Bruins and Washington Capitals. Keep up with our hockey coverage here. The last 15 games of the Major League Baseball season are today, and postseason picks up this week. Find all our baseball coverage here. And Europe reclaimed the Ryder Cup, golf's premier team trophy, defeating the U.S. 17 ½-10 ½. ____ 10. Among our most popular stories: Our writer Taffy Brodesser-Akner added to her string of eye-catching profiles. She sat down with Bradley Cooper, above, ahead of the release of ""A Star Is Born,"" his directorial debut. He's been involved in every phase of this multiyear project, down to choosing every shirt, every song and even the typeface for the credits. And he wasn't keen to stray off-message. ____ 11. Finally, a new documentary on Joan Jett, above; our Travel section's second annual issue dedicated to love; and seven ways The Village Voice made New York better. We have these stories and others in our Best Weekend Reads.

In honor of the anniversary, there have been approximately 1,000,000,000 pieces reflecting on the 2008 financial crisis and its effects. Many have suggested, rightly, that the political fallout continues to shape our world today. But as far as I can tell, surprisingly few have focused on the long-run economic effects. What's odd about this relative neglect is that even a cursory look at the data suggests that these effects were huge. It's true that U.S. unemployment is back below what it was before the crisis; although it's not widely realized, euro area unemployment is also way down, not quite to eve-of-crisis levels but well below its pre-crisis average. But in both cases we've returned to sort-of full employment at a much lower level of real GDP than informed people projected we'd reach before the crisis struck. I am, of course, not the first or only person to make this observation. Antonio Fatás and Larry Summers have been banging on this drum for years, as has Larry Ball. But it seems worth pointing out to a (slightly, maybe) larger audience the sheer extent to which the future is not what it used to be, speculating a bit about why and how that may have happened, and talking about its implications for future policy. 1. From the Great Recession to the Great Shortfall Economists use the term ""potential output"" to refer to the maximum amount an economy can produce without inflationary overheating. This concept plays a central role in monetary policy, and some role in fiscal policy too. As I'll explain in a bit, the theoretical underpinnings of the concept look weaker now, in the light of post-crisis experience, than they used to. But for now, let's just note that a number of agencies, from the U.S. Congressional Budget Office to the International Monetary Fund, routinely produce estimates of current potential output and projections of future potential output. To be clear, these are model-based estimates, not actual data. And one possible story is that the models are all wrong, that we're looking at a construct that has nothing to do with reality. But as I said, these models matter for policy. So what do we find if we compare pre-crisis projections of potential output over the decade ahead to current estimates? The answer is, a huge downgrading of estimates of economic capacity on both sides of the Atlantic. Figure 1 compares CBO's 10-year projection of potential U.S. real GDP as of January 2008 with what it now thinks happened. The downgrading of the estimate is huge – more than 11 percent as of 2018. One way to say this is that the U.S. economy is as far below pre-crisis expectations now as it was in the depths of the Great Recession, even though we have supposedly recovered from the crisis. Figure 2 shows comparable estimates for the euro area, from Fatás. We see a similar downgrading of prospects, but even bigger. This massive decline in GDP from what we used to expect, a full decade after the financial crisis, is a huge story – call it the Great Shortfall — that gets overlooked in the usual focus on short-term growth rates. What might explain it? 2. Three stories about the shortfall: happenstance, hypochondria, and hysteresis One possible story about the way the Great Shortfall followed the Great Recession is that post hoc wasn't propter hoc: the economy's potential is far less than people expected it to be a decade ago, but the reasons for the downward bend in the long-run growth curve have little to do with the financial crisis – they just happened to kick in roughly at the same time. That is, the roots of the growth slowdown lie in things like technological disappointment (there's a new iPhone; who cares?) and social change leading to a lower share of the population participating in labor markets (opioids or video games, take your pick) that would have happened even if there had been no Great Recession. This story is in effect, though not explicitly, the narrative underlying actual economic policy: the Fed and other central banks, which are the real actors in macroeconomic policy under current conditions, don't act as if they're very worried that a future recession might depress the economy not just in the short run but permanently. Fiscal authorities, to the extent that they think coherently about these issues at all – i.e., outside the current U.S. administration – also take the path of future economic potential mostly as a given. To be fair, CBO's projections try to take the incentive effects of tax policy and the effects of deficits on investment into account, but these are small change compared with what you would need to link the Great Recession to the massive downgrading of long-run growth projections. What's the evidence against this view? The most compelling evidence, cited by both Fatás/Summers and Ball, is that the size of the Great Shortfall varies a lot between countries – and the countries whose estimated economic potential has taken the biggest hit are precisely the countries that had the biggest slumps in the economic crisis. Indeed, the relationship between output decline in the crisis and the fall in long-run potential GDP is pretty much one-for-one. Figure 3 shows the most extreme case, Greece, comparing actual and potential GDP as estimated by the IMF. As everyone knows, Greece has suffered a huge, Depression-level slump. According to the IMF, however, around half that slump is a decline in capacity rather than reduced utilization of capacity. And even this understates the change in projections, because it's not just the future that isn't what it used to be, but the past. In Figure 3, Greece is shown as having had a drastically overheated economy, operating far above sustainable levels, in 2007 and 2008. But few people said that at the time. In fact, the IMF's own estimate as of early 2008 was that in 2007 Greece was operating only 2.5 percent above potential, compared with its current estimate of 10.7 percent for the same year. What's going on? The IMF's method for calculating potential GDP basically reads any sustained slump as a decline in potential output relative to previous expectations, and this interpretation of decline affects both its projections of the future and its interpretation of the past: if it concludes that potential output in 2010 was really low, the IMF marks down its estimates of potential in previous years too. Which brings me to a second possible explanation of the Great Shortfall: maybe it exists only in the minds and models of policymakers (or, actually, their technical experts), and isn't a real thing at all. That is, the belief that our economic potential has fallen far below previous expectations doesn't represent an actual economic ailment, but instead reflects policymakers' hypochondria. After all, how is potential output calculated? The details are complex, but basically such calculations rely on one or both of two theories: that slumps and booms are always short-lived, and/or that inflation is an ""accelerationist"" process. Suppose, first, that you start from the assumption that deviations of actual GDP from potential GDP tend to be eliminated over the course of a few years at most, with the economy surging after slumps and stagnating or shrinking after booms. In that case, you believe that the average difference between actual and potential GDP will be roughly zero over any extended period, which means that you can get an estimate of potential GDP by taking actual GDP and applying some kind of statistical method that smooths out the fluctuations. Suppose, alternatively, that you believe – as most mainstream economists did not long ago – in some version of Milton Friedman's ""natural rate"" hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, an economy running above potential output will experience not just inflation but accelerating inflation, while an economy with persistent slack will experience ongoing disinflation, with the inflation rate falling continuously and eventually turning into accelerating deflation. If this hypothesis is true, you can in effect infer where we are relative to potential by asking what's happening to inflation: if it's stable, the economy is producing roughly at potential. In the light of post-2008 experience, however, it's clear that both of these theories are wrong. When interest rates hit zero, it's far from clear why or how the economy will quickly recover, since the usual way we bounce back from a slump – the central bank cuts interest rates, boosting spending – can't happen. Meanwhile, thanks in part to the reluctance of employers to cut wages even in the face of high unemployment, even obviously depressed economies seem at worst to experience low inflation, not an ongoing slide into accelerating deflation. Given these realities, consider how estimates of potential output will respond if an economy suffers a big decline in overall demand that persists for a number of years. Because the economy remains depressed for a long time, statistical methods that don't allow for this possibility will falsely interpret a sustained slump as a fall in potential GDP. Because inflation, while it may decline a bit at first in a slump, typically remains stable thereafter, models that try to infer potential output from changes in inflation will also conclude wrongly that the economy is operating near potential. So is the Great Shortfall something that exists only in policymakers' minds, when the real story is that there's still a huge amount of excess capacity? It's certainly a possibility worth considering. And I'm reasonably sure that when it comes to Greece in particular, the huge decline in estimated potential output is exaggerated. I simply don't believe that after a 25 percent decline in real GDP, almost none of it made up by recent growth, and with 20 percent unemployment even now, Greece is only 2 percent below potential – which is the IMF's estimate. But this is a harder story to tell for the U.S. or the euro area as a whole. The simple version of the hypochondria hypothesis would be that officials misinterpret high unemployment as a structural problem when it's actually a demand problem. But at this point neither the U.S. nor the euro area has high unemployment by historical standards. Everyone knows the U.S. story; Figure 4 shows the euro area unemployment rate, which while higher than the U.S. rate is also now low compared with pre-crisis norms. It's true that many people argue that the unemployment rate has become a misleading measure of labor market slack, that the job market isn't as good as the standard measure indicates. But as Figure 5 shows, even broader measures like labor-force participation of prime-age adults aren't down all that much, and they were on a declining trend even before the crisis. So even a ""hidden unemployment"" story won't explain the hugeness of the Great Shortfall – that is, it's not enough to make what we see consistent with a story that claims that it's all, still, about massively inadequate demand. Which brings us to the third story, which is that the Great Recession itself damaged potential output, largely by reducing productivity. The idea that recessions cause ""hysteresis,"" permanently or quasi-permanently reducing the economy's capacity, has been around at least since a famous 1986 paper by Olivier Blanchard and Larry Summers. Blanchard and Summers were thinking in terms of unemployment: their claim was that slumps in Europe had permanently raised the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation. But you can come up with various stories about how a big slump could hurt long-run prospects in other ways, for example by depressing business investment, including spending on R&D. If that sounds a little vague, that's because it is. Fatás, Summers, and others argue that there has been a lot of hysteresis, and my instinct is to agree with them; but I'm not aware of work that pins down the channels through which this is supposed to have happened with any precision. We really need people to do this work, because if hysteresis is the real story, if the Great Recession caused the Great Shortfall, it has huge implications for the future. 3. Why the Great Shortfall matters Nobody wants to go through a repeat of the Great Recession, which is a reason to pursue policies that both reduce the likelihood of another financial crisis and increase our ability to respond if one happens. Hence financial regulation, expanded ability to seize troubled financial institutions (so as to be able prop them up without bailing out stockholders and executives), and so on. Some of us have also argued for a higher inflation target, which would leave more room to cut real interest rates when the next slump comes. If the Great Recession really did cause the Great Shortfall, the urgency of such measures is much greater. Using conventional measures, the Great Recession and the depressed economy that lingered for years thereafter cost the U.S. something like 15 percent of a year's GDP. If the decline in long-term economic prospects was also caused by the slump, this cost rises to something much bigger – possibly more than 70 percent of a year's GDP so far, and much more to come. Beyond that, as Fatás and others have argued, a link between short-run economic weakness and long-run prospects makes a huge difference to our assessment of policies in response to crisis. If monetary policy has run out of room, the case for fiscal stimulus becomes much stronger. And the argument against the austerity policies that many countries adopted instead when interest rates were still near zero and unemployment very high becomes overwhelming. In fact, as Fatás says, an austerity mindset risks creating a ""doom loop,"" in which fiscal contraction leads to a decline in economic prospects, worsening the budget outlook, leading to even more contraction. Greece has slashed spending, at huge social cost, but been rewarded – at least according to the official estimates – with a drastic decline in future prospects, so that its debt outlook looks barely better than it did before the cuts. So the Great Shortfall – the long-term shadow on the economy apparently cast by the Great Recession – is a huge issue. It deserves more attention, with maybe less focus on the few months of credit crunch after Lehman fell.

News,2018-09-30,"LONDON — When Theresa May appears on stage at the Conservative Party’s annual meeting this week, it will take all her determination to drown out the ticking of an invisible clock.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/world/europe/uk-brexit-theresa-may.html,1557," LONDON — When Theresa May appears on stage at the Conservative Party's annual meeting this week, it will take all her determination to drown out the ticking of an invisible clock. One hundred and eighty days stand between Britain and an uncontrolled exit from the European Union. Then it will be 179, 178. … After two years of negotiation, Britain has reached a moment of consequence for the process known as Brexit. The insulating layer of time that had protected the country from a potentially failed divorce from the bloc is thinning. Soon, it will be gone, with the threat of major new trade restrictions closing in. What this could mean for ordinary Britons has been seeping into the newspapers, sometimes in leaks from secret government reports: Northern Ireland has only one energy link to the mainland, so a no-deal Brexit could lead to rolling blackouts and steep price rises; and the energy system could collapse, forcing the military to redeploy generators from Afghanistan to the Irish Sea. [What is Brexit? A simple guide to why it matters and what happens next.] With an eye toward the March 29 deadline, the government has appointed a minister to guarantee food supplies. Pharmaceutical companies are planning a six-week stockpile of lifesaving medications like insulin and considering flying planeloads of medicine into the country until imports resume. That's if planes can still land in Britain — something thrown into doubt after the government admitted that aircraft could, in theory, be grounded by a sudden exit. In many ways, the country is in the same position it was on the morning after the 2016 referendum: without a clear plan. British leaders remain mired in infighting, still presenting competing visions as the Brexit countdown enters its final stage. Supporters of a so-called soft-Brexit would keep Britain closely tied to European economic rules and standards so as to minimize disruption to trade. The hard-Brexit camp backs the opposite approach: quitting Europe's customs union and single market and freeing Britain to draw up its own trade rules. On Friday, Boris Johnson, the former foreign minister and standard-bearer for the hard-Brexit faction, proposed starting over with a tougher negotiating approach, hinting that he might try to topple Mrs. May in the coming weeks. Jeremy Corbyn, the opposition Labour leader, rallied his own troops in Liverpool last week and all but promised that Parliament would vote down any deal that Mrs. May could strike. In the meantime, there is a strange calm, as if the country is waiting to see if a storm will make landfall. On Twitter, the novelist Robert Harris  recently compared the atmosphere to the months before Britain entered World War I, when the authorities watched helplessly as they were dragged toward war by the momentum of events. ""We're just rolling toward the cliff, and nobody out there is going to stop it,"" said Bill Wolsey, who owns a chain of hotels, pubs and restaurants based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. An abrupt Brexit, he said, would increase the cost of supplies and electricity in Northern Ireland by 20 percent and could curtail the flow of tourists from Europe, who are the backbone of his business. ""It's a strange time,"" he said. ""How many times have we heard this attitude through history — that it will all be sorted — and then nothing's sorted? I personally think nothing will be sorted."" In the two years that have elapsed since the 2016 vote, Britons have been replaying arguments for and against leaving the European Union. Was Brexit, as Mr. Johnson would argue, an act of emancipation that would breathe life into a once-proud imperial power? Or was it, as his opponents would contend, a gesture of rage by communities that feel left behind by global capitalism, egged on by politicians' false promises and tabloid-fueled xenophobia? So deep were the fissures in her cabinet that it took Mrs. May two years to produce a proposal — known as Chequers, after her country residence where it was forged — that would keep some of Britain's close economic ties to the bloc. Mrs. May says her ideas would remove the need for checks on the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union. But that plan was blown apart at a summit meeting in Salzburg, Austria, where other European leaders decided it was too much like Mr. Johnson's boast that, with Brexit, Britain could have its cake and eat it, too. ""Those who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be all right, and that it's going to bring a lot of money home are liars,"" declared President Emmanuel Macron of France. ""It's even more true since they left the day after so as not to have to deal with it."" On arriving home, the prime minister got no more comfort from a vocal pro-Brexit section of her party. ""Theresa May is in for a rough ride,"" Andrew Bridgen, a Conservative member of Parliament, said last week, as the Tory conference approached. ""She's flogging this horse of Chequers. It's flogging a dead horse. I'm not sure it's not the last horse she's got to ride."" With six months until Britain's scheduled departure, a void remains, leaving Britain stuck — unable to move forward or to rethink Brexit without risking a backlash from those who voted for withdrawal. Mrs. May's supporters say privately that delaying is a good negotiating tactic, and that her leverage will increase as the cliff edge looms closer. There is some truth to this. Other European Union nations would be damaged economically by a disorderly Brexit. And her critics in Parliament, where she has no real majority, may agree to any deal she can bring back if the alternative is imminent chaos. Her team plays down the dangers, at least for now. ""There are certainly risks of short-term disruption,"" Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, said in a recent interview with the international media. ""We can manage down some of those risks, and we can avoid some of them,"" he said, though he conceded that this was not completely in his power and that avoiding disruption ""will require good will on both sides."" Even if Mrs. May ultimately squeaks a deal through — and many believe she will — the spectacle of the two-year Brexit paralysis has permanently shaped international perceptions of Britain, said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy firm. ""It makes the United Kingdom look like the torn, deeply divided polity that it is,"" he said. ""It's a country that is inwardly focused, has infinitely wobbly politics, and will likely have trouble finding direction on many issues going forward. That's not good. It's a deeply divided, stuck political system. The cogs are grinding, and they will continue to."" If Mrs. May can reach a deal with the European Union and then get it through Parliament, that would trigger a 20-month period during which little would change while the details of future trade are worked out. In the meantime, many business owners are preparing for a worst-case scenario. Charles Owen, who runs bars and restaurants for British tourists in the Alps, made the ""deeply painful"" decision to sell two of his four venues. Still, the situation remains ""scary,"" he said, as some of his employees — many of whom are British — could lose their right to work in the bloc after March 29. ""I have no idea of what the legality of those people working in my bars and restaurants will be in the last four weeks of the skiing season,"" he said. ""It's scary."" A report from Barclays Bank suggests that an abrupt departure from the European Union would cost the food and drink industry 9.3 billion pounds, or about $12 billion, in additional tariffs, with a new average tariff of 27 percent. ""It's looking very grisly,"" said Ian Wright, the director general of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents much of that sector. ""And there is no evident way out."" AstraZeneca, the pharmaceutical company, says it has spent £40 million, or about $52 million, to duplicate some of its facilities in mainland Europe so that supplies will not be interrupted next spring. This summer, one of Britain's top health care regulators jolted diabetics by warning in an interview with The Pharmaceutical Journal that supplies of insulin could run out. Britain manufactures only a small fraction of the insulin its citizens need. ""It's something that we need to make sure doesn't happen,"" said Michael Rawlins, chairman of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. ""It could be a reality if we don't get our act together. We can't suddenly start manufacturing insulin — it's got to be sorted, no question."" Jim Moore, 47, a journalist who injects himself with insulin four times a day, has written about his anxiety over insulin supplies, notwithstanding the assurances he has received from officials. ""There is still the sense that they're far too sensible to let something like this happen,"" he said in an interview. ""There's a false kind of calm. It's as if we're waiting at the station, saying, 'We'll get this sorted out in the end.' And it preys on my mind, because what if it doesn't?"""
News,2018-09-30,"WASHINGTON — The United States and Canada reached a last-minute deal to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement on Sunday, overcoming deep divisions to keep the 25-year-old trilateral pact intact.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/us/politics/us-canada-nafta-deal-deadline.html,1346," WASHINGTON — The United States and Canada reached a last-minute deal to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement on Sunday, overcoming deep divisions to keep the 25-year-old trilateral pact intact. The deal came after a weekend of frantic talks to try and preserve a trade agreement that has stitched together the economies of Mexico, Canada and the United States but that was on the verge of collapsing. After more than a year of tense talks and strained relations between President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, negotiators from both sides came to a resolution just ahead of a midnight deadline set by the White House. The 11th-hour agreement was punctuated by a frenetic Sunday, with Canada's leaders teleconferencing throughout the day with top American officials in Washington. Mr. Trudeau convened a 10 p.m. cabinet meeting in Ottawa to brief officials on the deal, as Jared Kushner, one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, and Robert E. Lighthizer, the president's top trade negotiator, hashed out the final details. Mexico's under secretary of foreign trade, Juan Carlos Baker, was expected to present the texts of the agreement to the Mexican senate just before midnight. In a joint statement, Mr. Lighthizer and Canada's foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, said the new deal ""will give our workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region."" The trilateral deal will no longer be called Nafta, they said, but will be named the ""United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement."" The deal represents a win for President Trump, who has derided Nafta for years and threatened to pull the United States from the pact if it was not rewritten in America's favor. Overhauling trade deals has been one of Mr. Trump's top priorities as president and he has used tariffs and other threats to try and force trading partners to rewrite agreements in America's favor. On Monday morning on Twitter, Mr. Trump called the agreement a ""great deal for all three countries."" The Trump administration struck a deal with Mexico last month to rewrite Nafta and had threatened to jettison Canada from the pact if it did not agree to concessions like opening its dairy market to United States farmers. The White House had set a Sept. 30 deadline to release the text of its new trade agreement with Mexico. The agreement reached on Sunday includes changes to several provisions in Nafta. ■ International settlement dispute: A system that allows Nafta countries to rely on an independent body to resolve disputes will remain intact. Canada had insisted on keeping this provision, known as Chapter 19. ■ Dairy: The United States will be allowed to increase dairy exports into Canada, a win for Mr. Trump, who had insisted on greater access for United States dairy farmers. ■ Autos: Requires a higher percentage of a car to be manufactured in North America to qualify for zero tariffs. For the first time, the deal requires that a percentage of any vehicle that qualifies for zero tariffs must be manufactured in a factory where the average production wage is at least $16 an hour. ■ Tariffs — Steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place on Canada and Mexico, pending further negotiations. Canada and Mexico secure at least a partial exemption from any potential future American tariffs on automobiles. Canada's agreement to ease protections on its dairy market will provide access that is greater than what the United States would have gained through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade treaty that Mr. Trump withdrew from last year. [Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Subscribe to our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.] The United States also relented on its demands to eliminate an independent tariff dispute settlement system that Canada has said is a red line in negotiations. Keeping that was a major concession for the United States and a change for what was agreed with Mexico. The countries also reached an understanding that would protect Canada from the automobile tariffs that Mr. Trump has routinely threatened, though it is not clear how far those protections would extend. A senior administration official said that if those tariffs were imposed on global imports, Canada and Mexico would receive ""accommodations"" for their existing car production. But in a sign of how fraught trade relations remain, Canada did not win assurances that Mr. Trump would lift the steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed earlier this year. Administration officials said that no changes had been made and that those levies are being addressed on a different track. The agreement builds upon the deal that was reached with Mexico in August. That made updates to provisions surrounding the digital economy, agriculture and labor unions. Most importantly it made alterations to rules governing automobile manufacturing, in an effort to bring more car production back to the United States from Mexico. ""It's a good day for Canada,"" Mr. Trudeau said late Sunday, after convening a meeting with his cabinet. He said he would deliver more details about the agreement on Monday. After months of sputtering talks, momentum picked up this weekend as Mr. Trudeau inserted himself and made clear that he wanted to get something done. Mexico has also scrambled to try and ensure that the Nafta pact remains trilateral. President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico said on Friday that Mr. Trudeau had appealed to him to help pave the way for a three-nation deal and that he would insist that a revised Nafta include Canada. While Canada had played down the end-of-the-month deadline, the talks were restarted in earnest this weekend as the United States and Mexico signaled they would release text of their bilateral trade agreement as early as Friday. Mexico wants a deal signed before Dec. 1, when the new Mexican administration takes over, and the Trump administration wants the current, Republican-controlled Congress to vote on the deal quickly, given a potential change in control after the November midterm elections. Lawmakers from both parties have urged the White House to include Canada in any revised Nafta, warning that excluding Canada, which is America's largest export market, could disrupt supply chains, cost jobs and slow the United States economy. Companies and business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have repeatedly called on Mr. Trump to ensure Canada remains part of the pact, which has become critical for industries across North America, including automakers, agriculture and manufacturers. Industry groups cheered the deal on Sunday night. ""Manufacturers are extremely encouraged that our call for a trilateral agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico has been answered,"" Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. Discussions between the United States and Canada had stalled amid souring relations between Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Trump, who lashed out at Canada last week during the United Nations General Assembly meeting for mistreating the United States on trade. The president said he had rejected a meeting with Mr. Trudeau because of Canada's high tariffs, though Mr. Trudeau's office said no meeting had ever been requested. Mr. Trump also threatened to tax Canada's auto exports into the United States if it did not agree to America's demands. That followed a testy meeting in June, when Mr. Trump accused Mr. Trudeau of being ""dishonest."" A revised Nafta that includes Canada has a far greater chance of being ratified by Congress but its fate is still somewhat uncertain. Democrats could take control of the House or the Senate in the midterm elections in November and attempt to call for changes to the agreement. ""The crucial test for a new Nafta, or any new trade agreement, is whether it is enforceable, particularly with respect to promises to protect worker rights and the environment,"" said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. ""Americans are sick of hearing speeches about the benefits of new trade agreements when the agreements in place aren't even enforced and their opportunities don't materialize."" Lawmakers have said they do not expect Congress to vote on the deal until early next year."
briefing,2018-09-30,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/briefing/indonesia-brett-kavanaugh-elon-musk.html,1554," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Twin disasters devastate Indonesia, chaos grows around a U.S. Supreme Court nominee, a concession from Elon Musk. Here's what you need to know: • Nearly a thousand people are dead in Indonesia after a powerful earthquake and tsunami. The toll doubled over the weekend to 832 and is expected to rise further as rescuers comb through the rubble on the remote eastern island of Sulawesi. Nearly 17,000 people were left homeless in the main city, Palu, after an 18-foot wave destroyed the island on Friday. Indonesia straddles several tectonic plates and is highly prone to natural disasters. Since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that claimed around 230,000 lives across 14 countries, Indonesia has tried to upgrade its disaster response system. But the latest disaster has raised questions about the country's efforts: no warning siren was sounded before the wave hit the island and none of the 22 buoys at sea monitoring for tsunamis were functional. _____ • A tumultuous weekend in U.S. politics. On Friday, Senator Jeff Flake initially said he'd vote to advance Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination. Then, after being confronted by two women and mounting pressure from his colleagues, the Republican from Arizona asked to delay the full Senate vote by a week to allow the F.B.I. to investigate sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, above. Democrats denounced limits on the scope of the investigation as a farce, as it became clear that the White House had imposed limitations on the F.B.I.'s line of inquiry. The F.B.I. will question Mark Judge, a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh's who is said to have been in the room when the judge allegedly assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school. Three other witnesses will also be interviewed. We also fact checked Judge Kavanaugh's testimony and found inconsistencies that the F.B.I. could try to address. _____ • China confronts unlikely threats at home. The government has detained several dozen young activists, many of them students and graduates of top universities. The twist? The activists, above, are all well versed in the Communist Party's values and have been campaigning for economic equality — a major pillar of the party's own ideology. The crackdown on young communists is one of many steps by Chinese leaders to manage growing domestic unease, especially as the country heads into the throes of an economic slowdown. The government recently banned publication of negative economic news, particularly the consequences of the trade war with the U.S., while President Xi Jinping preached self-reliance during a visit to farms and factories around the country, casting himself as a modern-day Mao Zedong. Separately, China canceled an important annual security meeting planned for mid-October with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, the latest sign of bad blood between China and the U.S. _____ • From hero to pariah. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's civilian leader and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, above, was once hailed as a beacon of hope who would steer the country away from decades of military rule and into a stable democracy. Instead, she has turned a blind eye as the military has persecuted Rohingya Muslims, suppressed freedom of speech and done little to advance women's rights. ""Rarely has the reputation of a leader fallen so far, so fast,"" said a recent report from the International Crisis Group. Our reporter charts Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's fall from grace. _____ • Legacies threatened across Africa.  In South Africa, about 90 politicians have been killed since the start of 2016, more than twice the annual rate in the 16 years before that. Many of the targets are members of the African National Congress who have spoken out against corruption, imperiling Nelson Mandela's dream of a unified, democratic nation. Above, the outskirts of Umzimkhulu town center where a prominent politician critical of party officials was killed. ""It is the very antithesis of democracy,"" said one expert. In Senegal, fat, sprawling baobab trees that have towered over the West African country for thousands of years are being threatened by climate change, urbanization and population growth. ""Whenever you see a baobab that has fallen down, you're sad,"" said one local. _____ • Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, above, stepped down as the company's chairman as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve securities fraud charges against him. • 71: That is the percentage of working Japanese women who have had children, the highest on record. But many working mothers get part-time jobs, which means low pay, slim benefits and few opportunities to advance. • Facebook announced that an attack on its network affected nearly 50 million accounts, the largest security breach in its 14-year history. Here's how to protect your information. • Coming this week: Goldman Sachs's new C.E.O., David Solomon, officially takes the reins and the U.S. releases its latest employment figures. • Here's a snapshot of global markets. Markets in China and Hong Kong are closed today. • Many killer whales carry lingering remnants of polychlorinated biphenyls, known as PCBs, and scientists estimate that the banned toxic chemicals might wipe out roughly half of their global population in the next few decades. [The New York Times] • North Korea's foreign minister said there was ""no way"" the country would denuclearize without any concessions from the U.S., just days after Washington reiterated the need to keep sanctions against Pyongyang intact. [The New York Times] • A man in Hong Kong was found to have a strain of hepatitis E that had previously been found only in rats. [The New York Times] • Denny Tamaki, the son of a Japanese mother and an American Marine, won a close election for governor on the Japanese island of Okinawa in which he opposed an effort to build a new Marine air base. [The New York Times] • Brexit is just six months away and Britain still doesn't have a plan, forcing the country to prepare for the worst: a sudden exit that could disrupt energy, food and medicine supplies, and ground air travel. [The New York Times] • India will install air purifiers at major intersections in New Delhi in an attempt to reduce pollution. Experts are skeptical that this will work. [The Guardian] • Egypt sentenced a female activist, Amal Fathy, to two years in jail for posting a video that criticized the government's failure to protect women from sexual harassment. She is the latest victim of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's crackdown on dissent. [The New York Times] Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Recipe of the day: Start the week with something simple and comforting: kimchi rice porridge. • Traveling abroad? Here's how to eat like a local. • Be kind to yourself. • Neil Armstrong, for many people, cuts a historic figure who left footprints in outer space. For his sons, Rick and Mark, he was just an ordinary dad who took ""a business trip to the moon"" and sometimes made it home in time for dinner. As the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission approaches, they're auctioning off the astronaut's memorabilia, from his signed ""insurance cover"" card, above, to a rejection letter from the Diners Club. • Jellyfish have long been considered the dead end of the ocean's food chain — an unappetizing, low-calorie dining option for most predators. But new research suggests that the mesmerizing floaters may play a crucial part in the ecosystem's survival. • In memoriam: David Wong Louie, an American writer whose critically acclaimed works drew on his own experiences as the son of Chinese immigrants. He was 63. ""The park is a paradise that makes even the loss of Eden seem insignificant,"" wrote John Muir, a Scottish-American naturalist many see as the father of U.S. environmentalism. He was describing Yosemite National Park, created today in 1890, in large part through his efforts. Growing up in Dunbar, Scotland, Muir routinely risked ""sore punishments"" by a stern father to run off and explore nearby wilderness. His first glimpse of the Yosemite area, in 1868, transformed him. He roamed it endlessly. He called sheep set to graze there ""hoofed locusts"" for devouring the greenery. He worried about commercial exploitation and railed against clueless crowds. ""Somehow most of these travelers seem to care but little for the glorious objects about them,"" he wrote. The 1864 Yosemite Grant Act offered some protections, but Muir lobbied hard for more. After Congress established the park in 1890, Muir further lobbied President Theodore Roosevelt, taking him camping there. Roosevelt subsequently added new areas to the park. Muir's love of Yosemite never waned. ""It is good for everybody,"" he explained, ""no matter how benumbed with care, encrusted with a mail of business habits like a tree with bark. None can escape its charms."" Nancy Wartik wrote today's Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

Here are excerpts from their onstage conversation. They have been edited and condensed.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/us/jamie-dimon-new-rules.html,595," At the New Rules Summit, Rebecca Blumenstein, a deputy managing editor of The New York Times, interviewed Jamie Dimon, chief executive and chairman of JPMorgan Chase, about opportunities for women at his company and beyond. Here are excerpts from their onstage conversation. They have been edited and condensed. BLUMENSTEIN So you're the last standing C.E.O. on Wall Street post-financial crisis. JP Morgan employs more than 250,000 people around the world and is now the most valuable bank in the world based on market cap. What is the business case for having a diverse work force? Why does it matter? DIMON Half the people in America are women. So the diversity argument is very simple. It is the right thing to do, plain and simple. And that's good enough. It's not the reason, but you should do it. Second of all, if I pick from the best people, I'll pick a better team. And third of all, you know, like I said, we don't understand all the issues of other people without having a diverse work force. You have more ideas, you get more generations, you get better people, happier people. And so there's tons of arguments for it. More stories from The New Rules Summit Special Report. BLUMENSTEIN So JPMorgan probably does better than most on the women front. Half of the employees at JPMorgan are women, and 30 percent of the top 200 are women. How has that happened? DIMON So while I'm proud of that, you know, 30 percent of our V.P.s — it probably should be 50 percent. And there's a reason for that. And our people are pushing me about why. You know, and it's pay, promotion, opportunity, they don't like their boss. BLUMENSTEIN So half of your direct reports are women. Will there be a woman C.E.O. of JPMorgan? DIMON Could be. You know, we have fabulous people, and several are women, and several people who report to me can have this job one day. I would never say, well, we are going to go out of our way to make it a woman. It will be the best person for the job when the time comes. BLUMENSTEIN Are you surprised that the number of female C.E.O.s is going down? We were at 5 percent last year, and now the numbers have been falling. DIMON I know, but it's such a small percent, that's going to bounce around. It's not going to really change unless you have a wave of people who are moving up the ladder, and the 5 percent will become 10. But that's going to happen when 30 percent, or 40 percent of direct reports of C.E.O.s are women. … I see a wave coming, but I would say that wave is going to take 10 or 15 more years. Because they're not there right now. BLUMENSTEIN So you've done very well internally on some counts. The board is not so representative. Two of 11 members are women. DIMON I'm looking for a great female board member. … It's hard for me to do a board search and say I'm only going to look at women. BLUMENSTEIN Would the financial crisis have ended up differently if there had been more women at the table? DIMON No. But implicit in that question is, are women different and maybe better in the new world at management and stuff like that? And I'm going to answer this by saying on average, yes. On average, they pound their chest less, they're kind of a little more social, they work well together."
News,2018-09-30,"BEIJING — Well before dawn, nearly a hundred people stood in line outside one of the capital’s top hospitals.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/business/china-health-care-doctors.html,2742," BEIJING — Well before dawn, nearly a hundred people stood in line outside one of the capital's top hospitals. They were hoping to get an appointment with a specialist, a chance for access to the best health care in the country. Scalpers hawked medical visits for a fee, ignoring repeated crackdowns by the government. A Beijing resident in line was trying to get his father in to see a neurologist. A senior lawmaker from Liaoning, a northeastern province, needed a second opinion on her daughter's blood disorder. Mao Ning, who was helping her friend get an appointment with a dermatologist, arrived at 4 a.m. She was in the middle of the line. ""There's no choice — everyone comes to Beijing,"" Ms. Mao, 40, said. ""I think this is an unscientific approach and is not in keeping with our national conditions. We shouldn't have people do this, right? There should be a reasonable system."" The long lines, a standard feature of hospital visits in China, are a symptom of a health care system in crisis. An economic boom over the past three decades has transformed China from a poor farming nation to the world's second-largest economy. The cradle-to-grave system of socialized medicine has improved life expectancy and lowered maternal mortality rates. But the system cannot adequately support China's population of more than one billion people. The major gaps and inequalities threaten to undermine China's progress, social stability and financial health — creating a serious challenge for President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party. Then, there are the scandals. In July, hundreds of thousands of children were found to have been injected with faulty vaccines. The news angered the public, rattling confidence in the government and amplifying frustration with the health care system. While the wealthy have access to the best care in top hospitals with foreign doctors, most people are relegated to overcrowded hospitals. In the countryside, people must rely on village clinics, or travel hundreds of miles to find the closest facility. The country does not have a functioning primary care system, the first line of defense for illness and injury. China has one general practitioner for every 6,666 people, compared with the international standard of one for every 1,500 to 2,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. Instead of going to a doctor's office or a community clinic, people rush to the hospitals to see specialists, even for fevers and headaches. This winter, flu-stricken patients camped out overnight with blankets in the corridors of several Beijing hospitals, according to state media. Hospitals are understaffed and overwhelmed. Specialists are overworked, seeing as many as 200 patients a day. And people are frustrated, with some resorting to violence. In China, attacks on doctors are so common that they have a name: ""yi nao,"" or ""medical disturbance."" In 2016, Mr. Xi unveiled the country's first long-term blueprint to improve health care since the nation's founding in 1949. Called Healthy China 2030, it pledged to bolster health innovation and make access to medical care more equal. The deficiency in doctors has taken on more urgency as the Chinese government grapples with the mounting health problems of its vast population. Heart disease, strokes, diabetes and chronic lung disease account for 80 percent of deaths in China, according to a World Bank report in 2011. Mao Qun'an, the spokesman for the National Health and Family Planning Commission, acknowledged that the hospitals could no longer meet the public's needs. ""If you don't get the grass roots right, then the medical problems in China cannot be solved,"" Mr. Mao said. ""So what we're doing now is trying to return to the normal state."" On some mornings, Dr. Huang Dazhi, a general practitioner in Shanghai, rides his motorbike to a nursing home, where he treats about 40 patients a week. During lunchtime, he sprints back to his clinic to stock up on their medication and then heads back to the nursing home. Afterward, he makes house calls to three or four people. On other days, he goes to his clinic, where he sees about 70 patients. At night, he doles out advice about high-blood-pressure medications and colds to his patients, who call him on his mobile phone. For all this, Dr. Huang is paid about $1,340 a month — roughly the same he was making starting out as a specialist in internal medicine 12 years ago. ""The social status of a general practitioner is not high enough,"" Dr. Huang said, wearing a gray Nike T-shirt and jeans under his doctor's coat. ""It feels like there's still a large gap when you compare us to specialists."" In a country where pay is equated with respect, the public views family doctors as having a lower status and weaker credentials than specialists. Among nearly 18,000 doctors, only one-third thought that they were respected by the public, according to a 2017 survey by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Harvard Medical School, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the U.S. China Health Summit. ""There is no trust in the primary care system among the population because the good doctors don't go there,"" said Bernhard Schwartländer, a senior aide at the World Health Organization and its former representative to China. ""They cannot make money."" China once had a broad, if somewhat basic, primary health care system. ""Barefoot doctors"" roamed the countryside treating minor ailments. In the cities, people got their health care at clinics run by state-owned companies. China's ""barefoot doctor"" system was one of the Communist revolution's most notable successes. In 1965, Chairman Mao, troubled by the lack of health care in the countryside, envisioned an army of people who spent half their time farming (many worked in the fields without shoes) and half their time treating patients. They weren't doctors, but rather a sort of health care SWAT team. The authorities gave them a short training period — several months to a year — and a bag of limited medicine and equipment. Average life expectancy in China increased to 63 years in 1970 from 44 in 1960, according to Theodore H. Tulchinsky and Elena A. Varavikova, authors of ""The New Public Health,"" a book about global medical care. The maternal mortality rate in rural China fell to 41.3 per 100,000 people from 150 per 100,000 before 1949, according to a 2008 article published by the World Health Organization. In the same period, the infant mortality rate fell to 18.6 per 1,000 from 200. But the public was fed up that it could not get medical treatment whenever or wherever it wanted. People needed a referral to see a specialist in a hospital. In the mid-1980s, the government lifted the barriers, allowing people to be treated in hospitals. At the same time, China began an economic overhaul that led to the dismantling of the entire system. Government subsidies were cut drastically, and hospitals had to come up with ways to generate profits. As hospitals started investing in high-tech machines and expanded to meet their new financial needs, medical students were drawn to them. Many believed that being a specialist would guarantee them an ""iron rice bowl,"" a job that was secure with an extensive safety net that included housing and a pension. Dr. Huang initially followed the more lucrative path. After graduating from medical school in 2006, he started working as an internist in a hospital in Shanghai. But he kept seeing patients with simple aftercare needs like removing stitches, changing catheters and switching medication. ""These things really should not be done by us specialists,"" he said. When Dr. Huang saw a newspaper article about general practitioners, he decided to enroll in a training program in 2007. He was inspired by his aunt, a ""barefoot doctor"" in Mingguang, a city in Anhui Province, one of the poorest regions in China. As a boy, he had followed his aunt as she went to people's homes to deliver babies and give injections. ""After becoming a doctor, I've realized that the people's needs for 'barefoot doctors' is still very much in demand,"" he said. In March, a doctor was killed by his patient's husband. In November 2016, a man attacked a doctor after an argument over his daughter's treatment. The month before, a father stabbed a pediatrician 15 times after his daughter died shortly after her birth. The doctor did not survive. Dr. Zhao Lizhong, an emergency room doctor in Beijing, was sitting at a computer and writing a patient's diagnosis when Lu Fu'ke plunged a knife into his neck in April 2012. Around him, patients screamed. Hours earlier, Mr. Lu had stabbed Dr. Xing Zhimin, who had treated him for rhinitis, in the Peking University People's Hospital and fled. Police officers arrested him in his hometown, Zhuozhou in the northern province of Hebei, later that month. Mr. Lu was sentenced to 13 years in jail. ""We know that this kind of thing can happen at any time,"" Dr. Zhao said. The root of the violence is all the same: a mistrust of the medical system. It goes back to the market reforms under Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s. After the government cut back subsidies to hospitals, doctors were forced to find ways to make money. Many accepted kickbacks from drug companies and gifts from patients. In a survey of more than 570 residents in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou conducted in 2013 by Cheris Chan, a sociology professor at the University of Hong Kong, more than half said they and members of their family gave ""red envelopes"" as cash gifts to doctors for surgery during 2000-12. Dr. Yu Ying, who worked as an emergency room doctor at Peking Union Hospital, one of China's top hospitals, said she was once a valiant defender of her profession. On her widely followed account on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, she pushed back against critics who called doctors ""white-eyed wolves."" ""After I discovered the truth, I really had to give myself a slap in the face,"" she said. Dr. Yu said she had heard accounts from outpatient doctors who accepted thousands of dollars in kickbacks from drug companies — ""cash that was bundled into plastic bags."" ""In the entire system, the majority of doctors accept red envelopes and kickbacks,"" she said. The corruption is endemic. GlaxoSmithKline paid a $500 million fine in 2014, the highest ever in China at the time, for giving kickbacks to doctors and hospitals that prescribed its medicines. Eli Lilly, Pfizer and other global drug giants have settled with regulators over similar behavior. It all makes for a violent mix. Many hospitals are taking measures to protect their workers. In the southern city of Guangzhou, the Zhongshan Hospital has hired taekwondo experts to teach doctors self-defense techniques. Hospitals in the eastern city of Jinan are paying private security companies for protection. Last year, the government pledged to station an adequate number of police officers in emergency departments, where most doctor-patient violence occurs. Mr. Mao, the spokesman for the health ministry, said that while the figures for attacks on medical personnel looked alarming, they needed to be put in context. Chinese patients sought medical help eight billion times in 2016, a number that is equivalent to the world's population, according to Mr. Mao. There were roughly 50,000 medical-related disputes in that period, a tiny fraction of the total number of health visits. ""Therefore, our judgment is the doctor-patient relationship in reality isn't tense,"" Mr. Mao said. If Beijing hopes to overhaul health care, it needs to persuade a skeptical public to stop going to the hospital for the sniffles. To help change the culture, China is pushing each household to sign a contract with a family doctor by 2020 and subsidizing patients' visits. General practitioners will also have the authority to make appointments directly with top specialists, rather than leaving patients to make their own at hospitals. Such measures would make it easier for patients to transfer to top hospitals without a wait, while potentially giving them more personalized care from a doctor who knows their history. It could also cut down on costs, since it is cheaper under government insurance to see a family doctor. After the government's directive, Dr. Yang Lan has signed up more than 200 patients, and monitors their health for about $1,220 a month. From her office in the Xinhua community health center, a run-down place with elderly patients milling about in the corridors, she keeps track of her patients with an Excel sheet on her computer. She said she had memorized their medical history and addresses. Dr. Yang, 31, said her practice was largely free of grumpy patients and, as a result, ""yi nao."" She sees 50 to 60 patients in a workday of about seven and a half hours. In the United States, a family doctor has 83 ""patient encounters"" in a 45-hour workweek, according to a 2017 survey by the American Academy of Family Physicians. That's about 16 patients in a nine-hour workday. The patients get something, too — a doctor who has time for them. Every three months, Dr. Yang has a face-to-face meeting with her patients, either during a house call or at her clinic. She's available to dispense round-the-clock advice to her patients on WeChat, a popular messaging app in China. A patient is generally kept in the waiting room for a brief period and, if necessary, gets to talk with her for at least 15 minutes. On a hot summer day, an elderly woman with white hair walked into Dr. Yang's clinic. She has cardiovascular disease, and Dr. Yang told her to watch what she ate. Next, a man with diabetes dropped in. ""Hey, you got a haircut!"" Dr. Yang exclaimed. At one point, four retirees swarmed Dr. Yang's room, talking over one another. ""I think she's really warm and considerate,"" said Cai Zhenghua, the patient with diabetes. He used to seek treatment at a hospital, he said, adding, ""The time spent interacting with doctors here is much longer."" The government aims to increase the number of general practitioners to two or three, and eventually five, for every 10,000 people, from 1.5 now. But to even have a chance of reaching its goals, China needs to train thousands of doctors who have no inkling of how a primary care system should function and little interest in leaving their cushy jobs in the public hospitals. It is forcing hospital specialists to staff the community clinics every week and paying those doctors subsidies to do so. It is also trying to improve the bedside manner of doctors with government-backed training programs. In Shanghai, Du Zhaohui, then the head of the Weifang community health service center, introduced a test that uses mock patients to evaluate the care and skills of general practitioners. The doctors have 15 minutes to examine ""patients."" The teachers use a checklist to grade the doctors on things like making ""appropriate eye contact"" and ""responding appropriately to a patient's emotions."" At a recent test, one doctor, wearing crystal-studded Birkenstock sandals, examined a patient who had insufficient blood flow to the brain by swinging a tiny silver hammer, the equipment that is used for testing reflexes. ""That isn't the right way,"" Li Yaling, head of the center's science and education department, said with a sigh. She said the doctor was probably too nervous and should have used a cotton swab to stroke the soles of the patient's feet instead. Dr. Zhu Shanzhu, a teacher in the program, said one of the main problems was that doctors did too few physical examinations in the community clinics. Many of them lean toward prescribing medicine instead. Clinical reasoning, too, is poor, she said. In 2000, Dr. Zhu designed a course to train general practitioners in Shanghai's Zhongshan Hospital, at the request of its director. Her first course was free. No one showed up. Nearly two decades later, Dr. Zhu, 71, says that training is still insufficient and doctors do not spend enough time studying the latest research and techniques in their field. ""If there's more money, the good people will come,"" she said. ""And a high economic status will elevate the social status."" The government has pledged to increase the salaries of family doctors. But Dr. Zhu isn't optimistic. ""All these ministries need to coordinate among themselves,"" she said. ""Our country's affairs, you know, they aren't easy."""
News,2018-10-01,"Elon Musk was chastened by federal regulators on Saturday night, agreeing to step down as chairman of Tesla and to have his communications monitored.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/business/elon-musk-tesla-whats-next.html,1412," Elon Musk was chastened by federal regulators on Saturday night, agreeing to step down as chairman of Tesla and to have his communications monitored. But Mr. Musk, the exuberant, relentless billionaire chief executive of Tesla, showed no immediate signs of changing his style. On Sunday at 1:08 a.m., just hours after settling the Securities and Exchange Commission's fraud case stemming from his impulsive tweet on Aug. 7, Mr. Musk sent an email to all Tesla employees. He implored them to work hard, even though it was the weekend. ""One more day of going super hardcore and victory is ours!!"" he wrote. ""We are very close to achieving profitability and proving the naysayers wrong, but, to be certain, we must execute really well tomorrow (Sunday). If we go all out tomorrow, we will achieve an epic victory beyond all expectations. Go Tesla!!!"" Investors reacted to the settlement with a ""Go Tesla!"" of their own. After plunging almost 14 percent on Friday after the S.E.C. filed a securities fraud lawsuit against Mr. Musk, the company's shares regained virtually all of that ground in premarket trading on Monday. For all of Mr. Musk's late-night enthusiasm and the stock bounce, however, Tesla faces many challenges in the months ahead. The company is still struggling to produce and deliver its Model 3 cars, which are the key to its financial future. It is short on cash and has looming bond payments. Short-sellers are still targeting the company, betting on the stock to fall. The S.E.C. is continuing to look into the company's past claims about its production goals, and the Justice Department was also looking into Mr. Musk's tweet. And Mr. Musk himself — who also runs SpaceX and the Boring Company — remains a wild card, prone to unpredictable behavior that often ensnares his various companies. ""I get the feeling that the S.E.C. wants to have more adults in the room,"" said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University who contributes columns for the DealBook section of The New York Times. ""But will Musk listen to them?"" Neither the company nor Mr. Musk has issued a statement officially commenting on the settlement. For the past 10 years, since Mr. Musk became chief executive of Tesla, he and the company have been practically synonymous. He is its animating force, setting its strategic direction, making virtually all important decisions and working on nearly every detail of design and manufacturing. His intensity and ferocious work ethic have led to a wave of executive departures in recent years, and Tesla's board — which includes Mr. Musk's brother, Kimbal — is not particularly independent by the standards of most big companies. The terms of the S.E.C. settlement are intended to change some of that. Tesla will have to add two independent directors to the board, Mr. Musk will not be able to serve as chairman for three years and the board will have to set up a permanent committee to monitor Mr. Musk's communications with investors and the public, including his postings on Twitter and other social media. The members of this special committee will be subject to the review and approval of the S.E.C. Tesla also must ""implement mandatory procedures and controls to oversee all of Elon Musk's communications regarding the company in any format,"" according to the settlement. The S.E.C. will monitor to make sure the company is in compliance with those procedures. Perhaps reflecting the new scrutiny, Tesla put a substantial portion of Mr. Musk's all-hands email into a financial filing with the commission, dated Sunday. Some critics of the settlement suggested that the S.E.C. — which sought to bar Mr. Musk from serving as a director or executive of a public company in a lawsuit it filed on Thursday, two days before the settlement — was letting him off easy. Remarks by the S.E.C.'s chairman, Jay Clayton, about the settlement added to the perception that regulators were making an exception for Mr. Musk, who is so central to Tesla. Mr. Clayton said there was a need to balance penalties for violating securities laws with ""the skills and support of certain individuals"" who may be important ""to the future success of a company."" But Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School, said removing Mr. Musk from a leadership role in the company would have been a mistake. ""I think banning him as C.E.O. would have been out of proportion considering what he did and that he is the founder, major shareholder and brains behind an innovative company,"" she said of Mr. Musk, who is officially a co-founder. The S.E.C. is a civil, regulatory body, she noted, and its aim is to protect investors. ""While it shares some of the same goals as federal prosecutors, its mission is different."" The furor after Mr. Musk's post on Twitter in August that he had ""funding secured"" for a buyout of the electric-car company at $420 a share took attention away from Tesla's very real concerns about its products, and its balance sheet. Mr. Musk's email to employees was less bullish than previous forecasts he has offered about the quarter. Since late June, he has insisted Tesla will report profits and positive cash flow in both the third and fourth quarters. But in recent weeks, Tesla has been slashing costs and halting spending in hopes of turning a profit as Model 3 sales rise. In June, the company laid off 9 percent of its work force to lower costs, and recently stopped offering the Model 3 in certain colors. It has also delayed payments to suppliers. At the start of the third quarter, it owed suppliers $3 billion. ""It's hard for me to believe they will be profitable by traditional standards,"" said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of the auto information providers Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. ""You can be very creative in your accounting in how you define profitability, and whether you include certain costs in that or not."" While many analysts have focused on how many Model 3s Tesla is building, a more important indicator now is how many cars it is able to deliver. Unlike other automakers, Tesla doesn't generate revenue simply by making cars. It doesn't collect any revenue until it delivers them to customers. Companies like Ford Motor and General Motors book their revenue when cars are shipped to dealerships. Severe delivery problems would slow Tesla's revenue growth even if it is able to increase the number of cars it makes, and in the last several weeks, Tesla has encountered trouble shipping cars to end customers. On Sept. 16, just nine days after saying the company was having an amazing quarter, Mr. Musk acknowledged in a tweet that it was in ""delivery logistics hell."" Delivery problems have become so serious that Mr. Musk has suggested current owners could volunteer to help out at delivery centers around the country. ""The difference between being a niche automaker and a volume automaker is vast, and as you scale up, it can be very expensive to have to deliver every car to every individual customer,"" Mr. Brauer said. Analysts will also be watching closely to see if Tesla's third-quarter earnings meet Mr. Musk's stated goal of generating positive cash flow. In the second quarter, Tesla lost $742.7 million and used up more than $430 million of its remaining cash, decreasing its cash supply to $2.2 billion. Concerns about Tesla's cash position are all the more pertinent because Tesla is due to make a $230 million bond payment in November. A second bond payment of $920 million is looming in March. It can pay that obligation with stock, but only if the share price is above $360. On Friday, the stock closed at $265; it was trading around $306 before the market opened on Monday. As Tesla faces a decisive earnings report about a month from now, analysts — and the S.E.C. — will also be watching Mr. Musk's every remark, and tweet, to see if Tesla's corporate governance has changed. In effect, at the S.E.C.'s instructions, Tesla's board must now babysit Mr. Musk to make sure he doesn't say anything that could get him or the company in trouble. ""I am not generally a fan of these type of governance provisions,"" said Jill Fisch, a professor at University of Pennsylvania School of Law and an expert on corporate governance. ""But the ones in this case look pretty specific and well tailored to the conduct that is of concern."""
News,2018-10-01,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Sunday sued California to stop the state’s new law that would guarantee full and equal access to the internet, a principle known as net neutrality, in the latest legal fight between the state and the Trump administration.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/technology/net-neutrality-california.html,891," WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Sunday sued California to stop the state's new law that would guarantee full and equal access to the internet, a principle known as net neutrality, in the latest legal fight between the state and the Trump administration. The suit was filed shortly after Gov. Jerry Brown signed the net neutrality bill. The law is one of the strongest efforts in the nation to restore internet access rules since they were rolled back by the Federal Communications Commission last year. Governor Brown, a Democrat, has been a forceful opponent of many of the president's actions, including on immigration and environmental deregulation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that California's net neutrality law was illegal because Congress granted the federal government, through the F.C.C., the sole authority to create rules for broadband internet providers. ""States do not regulate interstate commerce — the federal government does,"" Mr. Sessions said in a statement. ""Once again the California legislature has enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy."" The California law positioned the state as a standard-bearer for internet regulation, and it follows the creation of an internet privacy law in June. Like California's auto emissions laws that forced automakers to adopt the standards for all production, the state's new net neutrality rules could push broadband providers to apply the same rules to other states. Xavier Becerra, California's attorney general, said the state would defend its new law. California ""will not allow a handful of power brokers to dictate sources for information or the speed at which websites load,"" Mr. Becerra said. ""We remain deeply committed to protecting freedom of expression, innovation and fairness."" The Justice Department suit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California. The debate over net neutrality has created a crowded legal battlefield. Mr. Becerra is also among 20 state attorneys general filing suit against the federal rollback of rules. Many broadband providers are expected to sue states that enact new rules, including California. California's net neutrality law prohibits telecommunications companies like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing down the delivery of internet traffic to broadband customers. The law goes further than the rules that the Trump administration eliminated, by also prohibiting promotions known as zero rating, that give unlimited streaming of certain sites for free but charge for others. The law is meant to protect consumers from attempts by telecom companies to charge extra or suppress access for some websites. The legislation is also intended to protect start-ups that could not compete with bigger websites that team with telecom companies for greater exposure to internet users. State Senator Scott Wiener, an author of the state bill, defended the law after the Justice Department lawsuit was announced. ""In their world, no one is allowed to protect an open internet,"" he said. ""We've been down this road before: when Trump and Sessions sued California and claimed we lacked the power to protect immigrants. California fought Trump and Sessions on their immigration lawsuit — California won — and California will fight this lawsuit as well."" The F.C.C. passed net neutrality rules in 2015 with the support of President Barack Obama. But the F.C.C. chairman under President Trump, Ajit Pai, has argued that the rules aren't needed, saying that there aren't enough examples of harm to justify rules on broadband providers. Some promotions, like zero rating, in which a company like Verizon may offer free streaming of Hulu but not Netflix, could be good for consumers, he said. ""The internet is free and open today, and it will continue to be under the light-touch protections,"" Mr. Pai said in a statement supporting the Justice Department lawsuit. Since the F.C.C. dismantled federal net neutrality rules last December, four states, including California, passed their own net neutrality laws. The F.C.C. has argued that the states are not allowed to create new rules. But state legislators and consumer groups have said they are prepared to fight any lawsuits. ""When the F.C.C. chose to ignore the millions of consumers who urged them not to repeal net neutrality protections last year, it left a void that state lawmakers are now rightly filling,"" said Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union. Mr. Schwantes said the California law was particularly significant. ""Thanks to its market power and influence as the country's largest state,"" he said, ""California's law sends a strong message to internet service providers and has the potential to shape the market across the country."" The California law was expected to set off lawsuits by telecom companies, which say strict rules would increase their costs. They argue that state laws create a difficult regulatory patchwork across the nation. Those suits could still arrive, even with the Justice Department's action. USTelecom, a trade group representing big broadband providers such as Verizon and Charter, criticized the rules for creating separate rules for California and other states. The group did not reply to questions on immediate plans for a lawsuit but several industry officials say the state rules are likely to be challenged. ""Rather than 50 states stepping in with their own conflicting open internet solutions, we need Congress to step up with a national framework for the whole internet ecosystem and resolve this issue once and for all,"" Jonathan Spalter, the president of USTelecom, said in a statement."

The old arena's four main entrances opened to the hordes of Los Angeles Lakers fans lined up outside. They poured in, slowed only by security checks, and some headed straight to the merchandise booths. For $120 they could buy a LeBron James No. 23 Lakers jersey, and many did. They crowded as close to the court as security would allow, and as the appointed hour approached, with a rustle of excitement in one corner, they aimed phone cameras and cheered as a chain of Lakers jogged onto the floor. Last was James, without expression and wearing a purple-and-black warm-up suit that may take some getting used to before it looks right. And, like that, in front of 13,565 fans in a small, sold-out arena past its prime and a global television audience curious to see where this all leads, the world's best basketball player made his debut with the Lakers, maybe the world's top basketball brand. To the amusement of Lakers fans and the possible bemusement of those who root for other teams, James's wardrobe switch became a reality on Sunday night. After he was formally introduced with the requisite spotlights and bombast, to the predictable burst of cheers, he took the court in the famed, golden Lakers uniform. ""It always feels different for me, any time you change uniforms,"" James said after the game, citing his moves from high school to the Cleveland Cavaliers, to the Miami Heat and back to Cleveland. ""Now being a Laker, it definitely feels different. It'll take a little bit of time to get used to it."" He still looked a lot like LeBron James, maybe in costume, with 9 points, 4 assists and 3 rebounds in 15 first-half minutes. He did not play the second half. ""It was great to get back on the floor and start a new journey for myself,"" he said after the game. James, who turns 34 in December, is starting his 16th N.B.A. season. He has been to the finals eight years in a row, while the Lakers have missed the playoffs the past five seasons, unprecedented in their illustrious history. Their owner, Jeanie Buss, gave Magic Johnson the keys to the team's basketball operations last year. Johnson went out and recruited James, with a four-year, $153.3 million contract signed this past summer, looking for an updated version of Showtime. The possibilities are intriguing, but even a playoff berth is far from certain. Under Coach Luke Walton, the Lakers were 35-47 last year, and James leads a roster that might best be described as unsettled. An interesting stew that includes Rajon Rondo, Brandon Ingram, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and JaVale McGee — the four other starters on Sunday night — will try to add spice, and not spoil, the flavor of the main course. James scored his first points on a deep 3-pointer nearly three minutes into a technically meaningless game. Somehow, he blended in, more eager to pass than to shoot, as if testing his new teammates to see what each could do at his side. He played most of the first nine minutes, missing 3 of 4 shots, grabbing a rebound and handing out two assists. He returned midway through the second quarter, sending a momentary jolt of excitement through the building when he took the court. ""Give it to LeBron!"" a young boy screamed from behind the team's bench, speaking for nearly everyone. He soon swished another 3-pointer. They were small exclamations in an otherwise understated performance, barely enough of a tease to provide clues for what to expect as the season unspools. The Lakers, James said, played some combination of players that had not practiced together. He tamped down expectations when he met hordes of reporters last week. Media Day is supposed to be a burst of optimism for all teams, before anyone sees the way the ball will actually bounce, but James had none of it. He was circumspect and serious. ""We got a long way to go to get to Golden State,"" James said of the dynastic Warriors, who have foiled James' championship hopes three of the past four years, including the last two. The Warriors? The Lakers may have a ways to get to the Nuggets, a rising team that finished one slot out of the Western Conference playoffs last season. They fell to Denver, 124-107, on Sunday. Fans, however, have let optimism flow, for now. This first preseason game was big enough that the longtime San Diego Union-Tribune sports columnist Nick Canepa felt the need to remind readers that this was not the biggest sports event in the city's history. Or was it? San Diego has hosted hundreds of N.F.L. games, including three Super Bowls, though the Chargers are now in Los Angeles. The Padres have brought the World Series here, twice, hard as it may be to imagine. Muhammad Ali fought Ken Norton in San Diego. And the old arena itself, Valley View Casino Center, used to be the home of the N.B.A.'s Clippers. It now mostly hosts minor-league hockey, indoor soccer and lacrosse. But it was also the site of the 1975 Final Four, where John Wooden coached his last game for U.C.L.A. in a championship victory. Yet, LeBron. The arena's concourse is lined with life-size photographs depicting the building's famous sporting events and concerts, Bob Dylan to Rihanna. There was a new poster, too: LeBron James's Los Angeles Lakers Debut. Eight hours before tipoff, ticket prices on the online secondary market ranged from $150 to $489. The Lakers and James play their first exhibition game at Staples Center, the team's home floor in Los Angeles, on Tuesday, also against the Nuggets. The Lakers begin the regular season in Portland on Oct. 18. By then, it might feel closer to normal to see James in a Lakers uniform. The question is if and when it will ever feel right."

Here's the latest: • The death toll from Friday's powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia doubled over the weekend to at least 832. It is expected to rise further as rescuers comb the remote eastern island of Sulawesi. Nearly 17,000 people were left homeless in the city of Palu after an 18-foot wave. Since the 2004 tsunami that claimed around 230,000 lives across 14 countries, Indonesia has tried to upgrade its disaster response system. But no warning siren was sounded before the wave hit. None of the 22 buoys monitoring for tsunamis were functional. Scientists were surprised by the size of the tsunami, and here's why. _____ • ""We're just rolling toward the cliff."" That's Bill Wolsey, owner of a chain of hotels, pubs and restaurants in Northern Ireland, where fears about Brexit have taken on an apocalyptic cast. Think blackouts, border troubles and a disastrous fall in tourism. Britain still has no agreed-upon plan for Brexit, though the deadline is six months away. Prime Minister Theresa May's proposal for an orderly exit is widely opposed. Whether her government survives, let alone whether Parliament passes a Brexit deal by the deadline, is an open question. In case there is no deal and the worst happens, pharmaceutical companies are stockpiling medication, and a government minister has been appointed to look after food supplies. Observers are drawing comparisons to the atmosphere before World War I. _____ • The Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance the Supreme Court confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, above. But a full Senate vote will be delayed by a week so the F.B.I. can investigate sexual misconduct allegations against him. Central to that decision was Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican member of the committee, who asked for the investigation after being confronted in a Senate elevator by two sexual assault survivors. ""You are telling all women that they don't matter,"" one told him. The F.B.I. will question Mark Judge, a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh's who is said to have been in the room when the judge allegedly assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school, and three other witnesses. Democrats said the limited scope of the inquiry could make it a ""farce."" We also fact checked Judge Kavanaugh's testimony and found inconsistencies that the F.B.I. could try to address. _____ • From hero to pariah. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, above, Myanmar's civilian leader and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was once hailed as a beacon of hope who would steer the country away from decades of military rule and into a stable democracy. Instead, she has turned a blind eye as the military has persecuted Rohingya Muslims, suppressed freedom of speech and done little to advance women's rights. Our reporter charts Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's fall from grace. _____ • A 2016 law in France has had unintended consequences for the country's roughly 30,000 prostitutes. In August, Vanesa Campos, 36, a transgender Peruvian prostitute, was shot and killed in a western Paris park as thieves tried to rob her client, who survived. ""Vanesa was murdered; the state is complicit,"" protesters chanted in Paris last month. Above, mourners paying tribute to her. French prostitutes say they have experienced a surge in violence since the passage of the law, which penalizes those who pay for sex rather than those who provide it. Because they shoulder the legal burden, clients have become far more demanding and prefer more isolated spots. Prostitutes have joined in asking for a review of the law's constitutionality. _____ • A referendum on whether to change Macedonia's name to North Macedonia was inconclusive, with both sides claiming victory. More than 90 percent voted in favor of the name change, but turnout was so low that the measure may not pass muster in Parliament. Above, supporters of a movement to boycott the vote. The governing Social Democrats and Western leaders had pushed hard for a resounding popular mandate for the name change. ""North Macedonia"" would appease Greece, which rejects Macedonia's name in a historical dispute, and pave the way for NATO membership. The vote was preceded by Russian disinformation against the name change. • U.S. and Canadian negotiators reached a last-minute deal to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement, overcoming deep divisions over issues like dairy protections to keep the 25-year-old trilateral pact with Mexico intact. The deal must still be approved by national legislatures. • Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, agreed to step down as the company's chairman and pay a $20 million fine in a deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve securities fraud charges against him. • Coming this week: Goldman Sachs's new chief executive officially takes the reins and European finance ministers meet. • Here's a snapshot of global markets. • President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has banned a longstanding weekly protest by a group of mothers over their sons' disappearances and deaths.

But new research suggests they may play a crucial part in the ecosystem's survival. ""The park is a paradise that makes even the loss of Eden seem insignificant,"" wrote John Muir, a Scottish-American naturalist many see as the father of U.S. environmentalism. He was describing Yosemite National Park, created today in 1890, in large part through his efforts. Growing up in Dunbar, Scotland, Muir routinely risked ""sore punishments"" by a stern father to run off and explore nearby wilderness. His first glimpse of the Yosemite area, in 1868, transformed him. He roamed it endlessly. He called sheep set to graze there ""hoofed locusts"" for devouring the greenery. He worried about commercial exploitation and railed against clueless crowds. ""Somehow most of these travelers seem to care but little for the glorious objects about them,"" he wrote. The 1864 Yosemite Grant Act offered some protections, but Muir lobbied hard for more. After Congress established the park in 1890, Muir further lobbied President Theodore Roosevelt, taking him camping there. Roosevelt subsequently added new areas to the park. Muir's love of Yosemite never waned. ""It is good for everybody,"" he explained, ""no matter how benumbed with care, encrusted with a mail of business habits like a tree with bark. None can escape its charms."" Nancy Wartik wrote today's Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

News,2018-10-01,"An ambulance ride of just a few miles can cost thousands of dollars, and a lot of it may not be covered by insurance. With ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft far cheaper and now available within minutes in many areas, would using one instead be a good idea?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/upshot/uber-lyft-and-the-urgency-of-saving-money-on-ambulances.html,833," An ambulance ride of just a few miles can cost thousands of dollars, and a lot of it may not be covered by insurance. With ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft far cheaper and now available within minutes in many areas, would using one instead be a good idea? Perhaps surprisingly, the answer in many cases is yes.  The high cost of an ambulance isn't really for the ride. It comes with emergency medical staff and equipment, and those can be very important, of course, even lifesaving.  But they are not things you always need, although you (and your insurer) pay for them with every trip. ""Don't reflexively call an ambulance,"" said Anupam Jena, a physician and researcher with the Harvard Medical School. ""Ambulances are for emergencies. If you're not having one, it's reasonable to consider another form of transportation."" The cost of ambulance rides adds up. In 2011, the United States spent about $14 billion on ambulance services, $5.3 billion of which Medicare paid for. Many of those trips might not have required an ambulance. Estimates of inappropriate use vary, but most are around 30 percent. Although it's not always clear when an ambulance is warranted, there is evidence of waste and fraud in the industry. Last year, ambulance companies collectively billed Medicare improperly for at least $700 million. In 2014, employees of a Philadelphia-area ambulance company received prison sentences for fraudulent bills. That same year, the owners of a Tennessee company were convicted of fraudulent ambulance billing. A 2015 O.I.G. report found that half of questionable billing of Medicare by ambulance companies is from four metropolitan areas: Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Houston and New York. Other recent evidence from New York suggests a substantial number of ambulance rides are taken for non-emergencies. Scholars from Georgia State University and the University of Colorado Denver studied ambulance rides in New York before and after the Affordable Care Act's coverage expansion. After the expansion, dispatches for minor injuries rose considerably while those for more severe ones did not.  By 18 months after the expansion, ambulance dispatches for minor injuries were up 150 percent. An explanation for the results is that a person's insurance coverage tends not to affect a decision about calling an ambulance in a real emergency. But for minor injuries, people are more likely to call an ambulance if they have coverage than if they do not, even if they don't really require that level of care. Using an ambulance also diverts attention and resources from true emergencies. Response times are longer than they could otherwise be if ambulances were used only when needed. One study found that the Affordable Care Act, by expanding coverage and financial access to ambulance rides, slowed ambulance response times by 19 percent. Uber and Lyft can't disobey traffic laws the way ambulances can to speed people to a hospital in urgent situations. But they can broaden transportation options for patients and could disrupt the ambulance market. Both have announced new services to provide rides to medical appointments. This kind of non-emergency medical transportation is something many health plans already provide, but Uber and Lyft may be able to do it more cheaply, with better customer service and less waste. Uber Health would allow health care providers to order rides for their patients. As of March, over 100 health care organizations were using the service. Lyft Concierge is similar and already being used by a number of organizations that arrange rides for people in need of care.  Of course, patients can request Uber or Lyft rides on their own, instead of an ambulance. And these services could help patients avoid missing appointments because of lack of affordable transportation. They may also help patients receive care in more appropriate and lower-cost settings, like a doctor's office instead of an emergency department. One study found that Uber's entry into a city reduced ambulance use by 7 percent. An advantage of arranging your own ride is that you can direct it to a hospital or doctor's office of your choosing. In contrast, ambulances take patients only to hospitals — and typically to the nearest one, whether the patient would prefer that or not. This can actually degrade care. Evidence suggests that patients who return to the hospital where they received major surgery have a lower risk of mortality than if they go to another hospital. With an ambulance, there is no guarantee you'll return to the same hospital. Although lack of affordable transportation is one barrier to care, it isn't the only one. A randomized study of Medicaid patients at two Philadelphia-area clinics found that offering Lyft rides did not change missed appointment rates. Patients may miss appointments for other reasons, such as being unable to get off work or to obtain child care. ""We often use higher-intensity care more than necessary throughout our health system,"" Dr. Jena said. ""Ambulance rides in non-emergencies is just one example.""  For some, the financial setback of an ambulance trip can be immense. An alternative choice for non-emergencies could save people thousands of dollars and help reduce waste in a system rife with it."

Shopkeepers were checking inventory as forklifts whizzed past streams of tourists hoping to get a final look. For more than 80 years, 900 licensed wholesalers at Tsukiji's inner market have sold 3,100 tons of fruits, vegetables and, most famously, fish per day to Tokyo's citizens. On Sept. 15, the last group of tourists lined up in the wee hours of the morning to secure one of 120 coveted spots to witness the final tuna sold at auction; Sept. 29 will be the last day for visitors before the facility closes to make room for the 2020 Olympics. The outer market — a maze of 600 vendors pedaling dried food, tea, souvenirs and more — is owned privately, not by the Tokyo Metro Government, and will remain in its current space for tourists to explore. Guided tours of the outer market with popular companies like Urban Adventures and Arigato Japan Food Tours will start up again at the end of October. But the bulk of the action will move to Toyosu Market, about 1.4 miles from Tsukiji; it is scheduled to open on Oct. 11, with tuna auctions starting the same day. (Tourists will not be allowed to enter the market until an as-yet-undetermined date late in October.) Unlike at Tsukiji Market, visitors will not be permitted to enter the wholesale or intermediate wholesale spaces. The move also means tourists who want to watch the world's most prized fish change hands will no longer require a 2 a.m. wake-up call. At the new Toyosu Market, visitors will filter into a designated standing room area that sits above the auction floor and watch from behind glass. ""The tuna auction will still start at 4:30 a.m. and last for about an hour. Visitors will no longer need to sign up beforehand anymore; just be there on time to score a good view,"" said Lauren Shannon, the general manager of Arigato Japan Food Tours. Approximately 530 fishery wholesalers will be moving in the coming weeks. For many, though, the move is still a mystery. ""I am anxious about going to Toyosu. So many things are still undecided,"" Oyama Akihiro, a fish vendor, said. ""The Tokyo government is less interested in the details of how to move the market and more concerned with the Olympic Games."" Indeed, many vendors and chefs are predicting various problems during the transition. ""The flow of the market will not work because a 15-minute walk separates the fish market and the vegetable market. And the price of the fish will increase for sure because buyers need to pay more for new systems and their stalls,"" said Naoyuki Yanagihara, a chef and vice president of Kinsaryu Yanagihara School of Traditional Japanese Cuisine. ""There is also only one road to Toyosu from the Ginza area so there will be a big traffic jam every day."" Mr. Akihro agreed that logistics will be an issue. ""There are only two gates in the new market to move product in and out. There are 12 here at Tsukiji, so that is another big worry,"" he said. Shinohara Masao, a second-generation fish stall owner echoed this sentiment. ""I do not want to go to the new market because it is inconvenient to get to and my customers won't come. Making enough money to live is a major concern."" The transition has also pushed out small business owners who have been in the market for years. ""The people who don't have the money to move, mostly small vendors, are not happy they have to close,"" said Yoshi Kurashina, a tour guide with Urban Adventures. As for what the empty Tsukiji market space will become, that, too, is a mystery. There have been talks about whether it will be turned into a bus terminal for the Olympics and later be converted into a sporting arena with retail shops. There are also rumors that the market could be moved back to Tsukiji in 2025 with the addition of a food theme park. A spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Central Wholesale Market said that decision has not been made."
News,2018-10-01,"A three-bedroom with double living rooms and a sunroom in Inwood would seem like a dream apartment to many New Yorkers. But once you fit in six people and a rabbit, perhaps not so much. In the Trader/Wolma family, however, you won’t hear anyone complaining.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/realestate/in-inwood-and-rabbit-makes-seven.html,1173," A three-bedroom with double living rooms and a sunroom in Inwood would seem like a dream apartment to many New Yorkers. But once you fit in six people and a rabbit, perhaps not so much. In the Trader/Wolma family, however, you won't hear anyone complaining. Jackson Trader, 14, shares a bedroom with his brother, Wesley, 12, and stepbrother, Jonathan Wolma, 15. The tiny third bedroom in their apartment belongs to their sister, Chloe Wolma, 17, and the living room is occupied by a rabbit named Max. ""Moving here was a big sigh of relief. It's been really freeing,"" Jackson said. ""Things are a lot less cramped."" Four years ago, when Rick and Dana Trader combined their two families, Rick and his two sons, Jackson and Wesley, moved into the Battery Park City two-bedroom that Dana shared with her two children from her first marriage, Chloe and Jonathan.  New York City children are used to sharing bedrooms, and even if squeezing four to a room was less than ideal, they made it work with a loft bed for Chloe and a bunk bed with a pullout trundle for Wesley, the youngest. To address disagreement over TV channels, they installed a TV-watching nook under Chloe's bed. ""But when we moved in together, the kids were so much smaller,"" Ms. Trader said. ""In a few years they doubled in size."" ""There was not a lot of breathing room,"" Jackson said. ""And Chloe had to get up for school at 6:15."" Asked if it was difficult to agree on decoration with three younger brothers, Chloe laughed. ""There was no decoration. It was less about aesthetics than 'How can we make it work?'"" They considered chopping up the master bedroom to carve out a room for Chloe, but concluded that it would be easier to move. At the time, they were paying $4,500 a month — Ms. Trader had moved into the Gateway Plaza building in 2007, and their rent-stabilized unit was considerably below market rate. Still, that amount, they figured, would go a lot further in a neighborhood that didn't have Gucci and Burberry stores, recent arrivals courtesy of the Brookfield Place renovation. Even their bodega had been replaced by Le Pain Quotidien. $3,300 | Inwood, Manhattan Occupation: Ms. Trader is the vice president of employee experience at Meetup; Mr. Trader is in sales at Braze, a mobile marketing company. Their children: Chloe and Jonathan Wolma, 17 and 15, and Jackson and Wesley Trader, 14 and 12 School commutes: Chloe and Wesley head to the Upper East Side to attend Eleanor Roosevelt High School, where she is a senior, and Robert F. Wagner Middle School, where he is an eighth grader. Jackson is a sophomore at the Bronx High School of Science, which is significantly closer than it was when he was living in Battery Park City. But Jonathan, a sophomore at Millennium High School, now has an hour commute rather than a 10-minute walk. Why they didn't stay in Battery Park City: Because of the growing crowds and the cost. After leaving their $4,500-a-month apartment, Ms. Trader said it was re-listed for $2,000 more a month. All the three-bedrooms they saw in the neighborhood cost at least $7,500 month. Buying in the city: The Traders considered it, but even million-dollar listings would have been a downgrade from their Battery Park City apartment. Instead, they sunk their down payment into an 1890s farmhouse in Salt Point, N.Y., where there is a swimming pool, a barn with a Ping-Pong table and ""lots of quiet and space,"" Mr. Trader said. ""It's all the things the city is not. We go up there most weekends."" But Manhattan is not a place with an abundance of reasonably priced family-size apartments. ""Once you go up to something in a family-size range, stuff skyrockets,"" Ms. Trader said. ""A three-bed is, like, twice the cost of a two-bed."" And cramped though it felt, they soon learned that their two-bedroom was actually spacious by the standards of the borough. ""People had taken one-bedrooms and hacked them into two-bedrooms. Some of the places we saw calling themselves four-beds were really two-beds,"" Ms. Trader said. ""We needed one where the living room was big enough so at least six people could sit down at once."" After a brunch with friends in Inwood, they walked past Inwood Hill Park, and Ms. Trader mused that she would move in an instant if a place in one of the townhouses along the park ever opened up. Mr. Trader had lived in nearby Hudson Heights years earlier, and they had initially been optimistic about finding a sizable place nearby, but the inexpensive, sprawling apartments of his youth had disappeared, replaced by awkwardly laid out one- and two-bedrooms. ""That was more discouraging than anything else, to know that that model was gone,"" he said. Then, hunting through StreetEasy on a family vacation, Ms. Trader saw a listing for a ""huge three-bedroom"" in a ""rarely available full-floor townhouse"" across from Inwood Hill Park. Rent was $3,300 a month. She immediately called the broker, Lincoln Wettenhall of Douglas Elliman, and was relieved to find out that she didn't have to fly back to secure the apartment, as showings wouldn't start for several days. ""We said, 'What do you need? We'll bring cash. We'll pay the year upfront,'"" Mr. Trader said. ""We were the first ones in to look at it."" Ms. Trader added: ""And still, somehow someone got in front of us. We were amazed.""  Fortunately, the competition dropped out and the Traders moved in a little over a year ago. While the addition of a tiny third bedroom might seem a modest improvement, their new apartment's layout is airy, with a sizable kitchen, a sunroom overlooking the park and, crucially, double living rooms, so the children have one of their own, with their own television and couch. ""Growing up in the Midwest, everyone hung out in the basement,"" Ms. Trader said. ""Until they got older, I didn't realize how much they needed a space where they could breathe without us hanging over their shoulders."" And while the family misses many things about Battery Park City — the movie theater, the Shake Shack, going ice skating at the Brookfield Place rink after a half-day of school, the community garden and the short commute for Jonathan, a sophomore at Millennium High School in the financial district — there are ample advantages to their new home. For instance, a shared backyard where they grow tomatoes and basil.  And using Inwood Hill Park as their front yard — ""Manhattan's last natural forest,"" said Chloe, who is happy to have a room of her own, at least for now. She will most likely be assigned a roommate when she starts college next fall.  Who, if anyone, will be allowed to take her space when she leaves is a matter of some contention. ""We'll try to be as fair as possible — probably drawing straws and rotating through,"" Ms. Trader said. ""But Chloe's always quick to remind us that she'll be coming home again.""

For the rest of the list, click here.) AMERICAN PRISON A Reporter's Undercover Journey Into the Business of Punishment By Shane Bauer Illustrated. 351 pp. Penguin Press. $28. Two weeks after Shane Bauer, a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine, began his undercover stint as a prison guard at Winn Correctional Center in rural Louisiana, an inmate jumped the razor-wire fence and sprinted into the surrounding woods. There were no officers in the guard towers to witness his escape; the private prison company hired by the state of Louisiana to run the facility, Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), had decided to save money by leaving those posts empty. An alarm sounded in the control room, but a guard ostensibly monitoring the battery of surveillance cameras saw nothing. Rather than review the footage, she simply switched off the alarm and returned her attention to whatever was occupying it beforehand. Hours passed before anybody noticed that the inmate was gone. The situation at Winn went downhill from there, as Bauer revealed in a 35,000-word exposé that ran in Mother Jones in the summer of 2016, an article that immediately became one of the most celebrated achievements in that venerable publication's recent renaissance. ""American Prison"" reprises that page-turning narrative, and adds not only the fascinating back story of CCA, the nation's first private prison company, but also an eye-opening examination of the history of corrections as a profit-making enterprise, of which the advent of the private prisons that now house 8 percent of American inmates is only the latest chapter. Bauer's reporting has inevitably sparked comparisons to Ted Conover's book ""Newjack,"" for which the renowned journalist spent a year in the late 1990s working at New York's infamous Sing Sing prison to better understand what it's like to pursue a career as a professional jailer. But this is not what Bauer is writing about, because a career is not what a company like CCA offers its employees. At Sing Sing, which is staffed by state employees, new hires spend two months at a training academy, enjoy good pay and benefits guaranteed by a strong union, are supervised by seasoned officers and can look forward to a decent retirement. At Winn, Bauer gets four weeks of training — when his instructors show up, that is — and the pay starts at $9 per hour. He soon discovers that all guards earn that rate, no matter how long they have worked at Winn. The only way to earn more is to make rank, but most don't stay long enough to get promoted. Turnover is so high and staffing so short that Bauer himself is asked to begin training cadets less than seven weeks into his tenure. The company's main concern seems to be maintaining parity with the local Walmart, where the pay is comparable, and the conditions presumably less anxiety-inducing. ""People say … we'll hire anybody,"" the prison's head of training tells Bauer and his fellow cadets. ""Which is not really true, but if you come here and you breathing and you got a valid driver's license and you willing to work, then we're willing to hire you."" (Yes, that is an exact quote — Bauer carried a recording device concealed in a pen.) If you like that line, you'll love this book; the sheer number of forehead-slapping quotes from Bauer's superiors and fellow guards alone are worth the price of admission. Every management decision at Winn, Bauer discovers, is dictated by one imperative: maintaining profitability by squeezing expenses. This begins with the low pay, which leads to staffing shortages dire enough to threaten the safety of both guards and inmates. But the crisis at Winn goes much deeper. During his four-month tenure, Bauer documents a dozen stabbings; scores of ""use of force"" incidents (far more than at comparable state-run units); cell doors that can be opened by inmates; atrocious medical care; and a seemingly preventable inmate suicide. He records guards shamelessly admitting that they trained bloodhounds by using actual inmates, beat inmates outside the view of cameras and routinely failed to perform the most basic elements of their jobs. ""Ain't no order here,"" a convict says. ""Inmates run this bitch, son."" It is less of a boast than a complaint, because the situation is dangerous for everybody involved. If Conover set out to discover what it's like to be in charge of a prison, Bauer asks a different question: What is it like to work — or serve time — in a prison where nobody is in charge? His survey of profit-driven incarceration begins in the mid-19th century and strikes a familiar theme, that mass incarceration in the South was simply slavery by another name. But Bauer adds new details, especially about the history of convict leasing, in which entire prisons — filled mostly with African-American inmates — were rented out to individuals or companies to provide a captive work force. Convicts did more than plant cotton. The textile mill inside Texas' first penitentiary became the largest factory in the state, and inmates were used throughout the South to dig mines and build railroads, generally working under horrible conditions. Death rates were staggeringly high; convicts, unlike slaves, cost nothing to replace. As much as anything, this is the story of the South trying to compete with Northern industry without disturbing the region's existing power structure, which is to say, without labor unions. Inmates were the original scabs. Prisons operated by companies like CCA (recently rebranded as CoreCivic), which was founded in 1983 and is now a $3.04 billion publicly traded concern, don't typically grow crops or manufacture anything of value. Inmates themselves are the commodities, and money is made by persuading legislators that a private operator can confine and care for them more cheaply — in Winn's case, $34 per inmate per day — than the state. Of course, penny-pinching and staff shortages are found at state-run lockups, too (especially in places like Louisiana), but there is another consideration when a profit-seeking middleman gets involved: What happens when setting a prisoner free is detrimental to a company's bottom line? Bauer discovers that a Winn inmate was held for a full year after he was eligible for release, ostensibly because he had no address in Louisiana that would take him in — a technicality that presumably earned the company an additional $12,410 from his continued incarceration. It's not just the convicts who are being exploited. Most of the guards at Winn, like Bauer himself, are afraid of their charges and resentful of the chaos that makes their jobs more dangerous. Bauer is a generous narrator with a nice ear for detail, and his colleagues come across as sympathetic characters, with a few notable exceptions. In a wonderful twist, he interviews a number of them after his deception is eventually exposed. How much loyalty does $9 per hour buy? About as much as you'd imagine; most are all too happy to help pull the curtain back on CCA. Bauer's takeaway is that private prisons like Winn can't be fixed, that the profit motive inevitably drives companies to take risks and cut corners. He's not the only one to draw that conclusion; after Mother Jones ran his article, Bauer was invited to Washington to talk to federal officials studying the efficacy of private prisons. Not long after, the Obama administration announced that the Department of Justice would no longer contract with CCA or its ilk. It turned out to be a short-lived mandate, reversed almost immediately by the incoming attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Today the industry is thriving thanks to a bull market in immigrant detention. As for Winn, conditions at the unit continued to deteriorate until personnel from a state-run prison stormed in and temporarily regained control. Two weeks after Bauer left, CCA voluntarily withdrew from its contract, essentially admitting that the facility was a lost cause. Louisiana officials didn't see it that way, however. Another company, LaSalle Corrections, promptly took over management of Winn, though the state is no longer paying CCA's bargain rate of $34 per day. LaSalle agreed to do the job for $24."

""Sometimes you say, 'I'm sorry we've done this.' Or 'Apologies for this.' Or 'I'm sorry that this happened.' You've got to understand the situation and you need to mix it up."" This is the Age of Sorry for nearly every train company in Britain. In May, Network Rail, which owns the country's entire rail infrastructure, unveiled its twice-a-year revision to daily timetables. Because of new connections and services, there were some four million changes, about seven times the usual number. The result was a shambles. Naturally, Network Rail later apologized. Train companies like Great Western, which are granted franchise rights to run different lines, are still coping with the aftermath, made worse by a continuing and tricky upgrade to larger and spiffier trains. There have been tens of thousands of delays and cancellations, enraging just as many passengers. The anger, in turn, has prodded train companies to a seemingly endless cascade of apologies. A running total of online train company regrets is available on a website Sorryfortheinconvenience.co.uk, created by Omid Kashan, a fed-up commuter and web designer. It tallies up apologies from the Twitter accounts of 25 British rail companies. All together, they have tweeted ""sorry"" more than 417,000 times since the start of the year. Great Western is one of the sorriest train lines of them all. Its six-member social media team is split between Plymouth and the company's headquarters in Swindon, a town that has been synonymous with trains since the early 19th century, when Great Western manufactured locomotives and rail cars here, and built houses for its workers. The Great Western team has issued 30,000 apologies since the start of the year, an average of 110 per day. (Only one company, the Northern, apologizes more.) Customers pepper the Great Western Twitter feed, @GWRHelp, about 1,000 times every 24 hours. ""Missing my London connection again!"" wrote Holly Rush not too long ago. ""Well done u bunch of idiots."" Compliments regularly pop up, too, but those are outnumbered by gripes about doors that won't open, inexplicable odors, reservation mix-ups and more. People routinely post photographs of crowded trains, or trash that has been left by other passengers. Many add withering hashtags, like #whenwillwelearn, #ripoffservice and #thisisnotgoodenough. Through it all, the social media staff patiently offers guidance, explanations — and apologies. A name is attached to each Great Western response, just one way the team tries to convey sincerity. ""When you type, it's difficult to make it sound like you're not being patronizing or sarcastic,"" said Joanna Linzinger, who manages the team. ""So we have to try really hard to make our sorries sound like they're coming from a warm person rather than a keyboard."" Apologies are one of Britain's great linguistic specialties, and have been at least since the days of Shakespeare's time. ""Pardon"" appears in the canon over 300 times, said Barry Edelstein, artistic director of The Old Globe in San Diego. At the end of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" an apology is offered directly to the audience. ""Puck explains that the whole story was a dream, so if it was offensive, no harm done,"" Mr. Edelstein explained. ""This was a common trope in Shakespeare's period: the actors apologizing for how bad the play was. It's all done with great irony, of course."" Which gets to one truth about British apologies: Their abundance isn't always an indicator of courtesy. ""Sorry"" is sometimes a reflex — people here say it to inanimate objects that they bump into — and the word is put to a wider variety of uses than in the United States. ""One study found four times as many 'sorries' in British English compared to American English,"" said Lynne Murphy, author of ""The Prodigal Tongue: The Love-Hate Relationship Between American and British English."" ""In a lot of instances — like when someone holds a door for you — it's used instead of 'thank you,' which I think reflects a kind of unease with strangers,"" she said. ""You're sorry because you're self-conscious about the fact that someone noticed you and has done something for you."" Great Western was created by Parliament in 1833, with Isambard Kingdom Brunel as chief engineer. He would transform Swindon, a modest market town — the name is said to derive from the Old English for ""pig farm"" — into an industrial center, as well as a key transit junction between London and Bristol. Today, the Museum of the Great Western Railway, known as Steam, occupies part of the old train manufacturing site. The works closed long ago, and today Great Western is essentially a rail service company with about 6,000 employees. The ones who work on the trains — as opposed to the social media team, who work behind computers — do not get specific instructions on the fine art of apologizing. Instead, they go through an extensive program called Great Experience Makers, which includes a daylong crash course in empathy. At a recent session, Kerry Cooney, a trainee, told the class a story about getting stuck at a station on a Great Western train from Reading. ""The first announcement by the crew was, 'I'm really sorry ladies and gentlemen, but we can't find the driver,'"" she said. Another announcement soon clarified. The driver wasn't missing. He was stuck on another Great Western train. To land his job on the social media team, Mr. Couch had to demonstrate, among other skills, a capacity to endure abuse, and throughout a recent 4 p.m. to midnight shift, he was unflappable. His office is on the second floor of a modern building, with space for about 10 cubicles and a view of the entrance of an underground parking garage. With a bottle of Coke and a bag of paprika-flavored potato chips beside his keyboard, he worked through one question and complaint after another. A woman named Ali wanted someone to hush passengers in the quiet car of her train. Searching through a staff directory, Mr. Couch instantly found the cellphone number of the manager on that train and called. The manager didn't pick up. It was the first ""sorry"" of the night. A passenger named James Edwards fumed that he was stuck between Worcester Shrub Hill and Pershore. ""You are an utter disgrace to the industry and public service,"" he tweeted. ""Your comments please?"" Mr. Couch did a quick bit of research, explained what was wrong with the train and apologized. More tweets piled up. ""Congratulations you incompetent clowns,"" wrote @jammyjamiejames. ""Train arrived 2 mins late from Marlow Branch. 17:28 to Maidenhead had already departed."" This one didn't take any research. ""Sorry to hear this,"" Mr. Couch wrote. ""The connections can't always wait as this can cause a knock on impact on later services."" There was outrage about reserved seats that had not been reserved and demands for refunds. One of them was from a woman who grumbled that she had been delayed twice this week on Great Western trains. Mr. Couch asked what kind of ticket she had. ""If it's a daily, she might get compensation,"" he said, before he started to type an apology. ""See? It's not all doom and gloom."""
News,2018-10-01,"When he campaigned for governor, Philip D. Murphy leaned on a recurring quip in his stump speech: “New Jersey was Silicon Valley before there even was a Silicon Valley.” He was conjuring the New Jersey of a decade ago, when the state was a leader in new and thriving companies in industries like biotech. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/nyregion/new-jersey-venture-capital-murphy.html,1140," When he campaigned for governor, Philip D. Murphy leaned on a recurring quip in his stump speech: ""New Jersey was Silicon Valley before there even was a Silicon Valley."" He was conjuring the New Jersey of a decade ago, when the state was a leader in new and thriving companies in industries like biotech.  Now, as he seeks to reshape the state's economy, Mr. Murphy wants New Jersey to utilize one of the most quintessential, lucrative and risky practices of Silicon Valley: venture capitalism.  As part of an economic plan the governor announced on Monday, Mr. Murphy proposed to establish a fund that would allow the state to partner with private venture capitalists to invest in start-up companies that agree to set up shop in New Jersey.  Mr. Murphy's move toward providing cash through public-private partnerships, rather than offering more traditional tax incentives to lure new business, comes as New Jersey struggles to develop homegrown companies. While New Jersey was among the top five states for venture capital investment a decade ago, it has fallen to 15th.  ""We've had a very sort of blunt-instrument, one-size-fits-all, big-company-focused tax incentive program that was our whole strategy,"" Mr. Murphy said in an interview. ""And almost nothing toward the start-up community."" The proposal is both unusual and routine: States often try to incentivize new companies to lay down roots, often with mixed results. But directly investing in start-ups carries additional risks. The companies could fail, and New Jersey would lose much-needed tax revenue. The private firms also could choose not to share their most lucrative opportunities with the state.  New Jersey has also recently seen its younger generations flee the state, limiting the talent pool that is vital to start-ups.  And this being New Jersey, putting state money into private companies has the potential to lead to political favoritism or corruption.  ""This is going to have to be very transparent process,"" Mr. Murphy said.  The proposal calls for raising $500 million over five years to create the New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Fund. About $250 million would be generated through an auction of tax credits to New Jersey corporations and the other half would come from matching funds from private venture capital firms.  Venture capital is among the riskiest of asset classes, and directly involving state funds could lead to losses. But Mr. Murphy said the current tax incentive plan was not working.  ""I look at the results for what we've gotten back, and we're spending a billion dollars per year"" and still falling behind, Mr. Murphy said, referring to current tax incentives. ""We're trying to jump-start industries that have been in our sweet spots forever. Life science, advance manufacturing, biotech, to pick a few."" The governor, through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, plans to auction off $60 million worth of tax credits every year for five years to major companies with tax liabilities in New Jersey.  The governor's model predicts that the tax credits will sell for roughly 90 cents on the dollar, giving some of New Jersey's major companies a tax break. That auction money — which the authority estimates will be about $250 million — would fund the program. This, of course, means the state would be diverting tax revenue into the new fund.  Through a dollar-for-dollar match from private-industry partners, the state hopes to build a fund of $500 million.  This type of fund is more useful to entrepreneurs than traditional tax breaks, Mr. Murphy said. ""Tax incentives for start-ups is a non sequitur because they don't have any profits,"" Mr. Murphy said. ""So there's nothing to tax."" The E.D.A. is under Mr. Murphy's control, enabling him to create the New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Fund without the approval of another branch of government. But auctioning tax credits would require legislative approval. Mr. Murphy said on Friday that he had ""already begun those conversations.""  Stephen M. Sweeney, the Senate president, did not return requests for comment.  The two men have had a checkered legislative record since Mr. Murphy became governor in January. Working together, they passed some progressive bills on issues like voting rights, immigration and the environment, but they disagreed bitterly over the so-called millionaire's tax, leading to a fight that nearly shut down the government.  Still, Mr. Murphy said he is ""pretty optimistic, actually"" that he will have the needed legislative support.  No. New Jersey is looking to partner with the firms.  The state does not want to be solely responsible for vetting pitches and business plans. Instead, it would partner with a venture capital firm once that firm had decided to invest.  If, for example, an entrepreneur is seeking $20 million to launch a product and finds a venture capital firm willing to invest, the firm can then request that the state split the cost. The goal, according to the governor's office, is to minimize the private company's risk while offering an incentive to provide funding to start-ups in New Jersey. Mr. Murphy said he has not spoken to any venture capital firms yet.  Chris Sugden, a managing partner at Edison Partners, a New Jersey-based venture capital firm, said he liked the idea.  ""Having the New Jersey program come in to put 50 percent of the bucks to match it, that's pretty attractive,"" Mr. Sugden said. But, he added, the wheels of government and the speed of venture capital do not always move in sync.  ""This market moves fast,"" Mr. Sugden said. ""The best deals — you've got to be able to move fast. And that's how I've shared it. I understand the desire to make sure the money is invested in New Jersey, but you also don't want guys in my business to be missing deals."" Any company receiving investments from New Jersey will need to be based in the state.  ""That's the only 'must' with this plan,"" Mr. Murphy said.  But restrictions in the venture capital world can be problematic, said Ian Hathaway, the research director at the Center for American Entrepreneurship, which studies start-ups.  ""You start getting into problems when you put restrictions on it, because if I'm a top-tier investor, why do I even want to deal with that?"" he said.  Mr. Hathaway said government programs designed to spur start-up growth need to ""get their house in order first.""  That, he said, ranges from ""making sure you have favorable capital gains tax policies"" to more indirect issues. ""Like what is the quality of life in New Jersey for well-educated professionals who have the option to live somewhere else?"" Mr. Hathaway said. New Jersey ranked 50th in the 2019 State Business Tax Climate Index issued by the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank. ""There's a difference between making it easier for companies that are already in the state to raise venture capital,"" Mr. Hathaway said. ""It's quite another to say: Will people pick up and move to New Jersey because there's more capital available?"" "

I'm taking over this bonus issue of the Canada Letter in honor of the new North American Free Trade Agreement, or the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, as it will soon be known. Who would have thought that the United States and Canada, two countries that are historically the best of friends and neighbors, would be staring down a midnight deadline on the brink of a trade war? [Read: Trump Hails Revised Nafta Deal as a Trade Promise Kept] But that is where we found ourselves last weekend. After months of hearings, meetings, missed deadlines and summer stakeouts outside of the United States trade representative office, most trade reporters, myself included, were not expecting that an agreement would really be reached over the weekend. But then on Friday night, the Canadians, who had previously showered reporters with briefings, updates, notes of encouragement and even Popsicles, went silent. United States officials, who are notoriously less loquacious, also went totally dark. Rather than negotiate on President Trump's turf, Chrystia Freeland, Canada's foreign minister (and, full disclosure, my former boss at Financial Times), scrapped her speech at the United Nations and hunkered down in Ottawa to huddle with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Hordes of Canadian reporters who had been camped out in sweltering Washington all summer were instead bemoaning the chilly autumn weather outside of Mr. Trudeau's office. By Sunday afternoon it was clear that things were getting serious. [Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Subscribe here.] Congressional aides — the sieve of Washington — were getting briefed by the staff of Robert E. Lighthizer, Mr. Trump's top trade adviser, and I started getting calls from lobbyists with fresh details. In the early evening, a Mexican official sent me a text saying copies of the agreement would be delivered to Mexico's Senate within hours. A colleague who covers the White House alerted me that Jared Kushner, a White House adviser who was on the United States negotiating team, skipped a Sukkot dinner to work on the deal's finishing touches. For much of the last year, White House officials lamented publicly and in private that the biggest obstacle to getting a new Nafta was Canada's fixation on protecting its milk market. Two hours before the midnight deadline, sitting on my sofa in gym clothes next to my snoring Boston terrier, I messaged one of Mr. Trump's closest economic advisers asking if Canada had finally yielded on dairy. ""Canada good,"" this person simply said. And the deal was done. [Read: For Canada, a Sigh of Relief More Than a Celebration in New Nafta Deal] Or was it? While most of the business world is happy that a trade war has been averted, Mr. Trump must get his trade treaty through Congress next year. That's never an easy task, but if Democrats are in control after the United States' elections in November, it could be even harder. As Mr. Trump said on Monday, ""In theory, there should be no trouble, but anything you submit to Congress is trouble, no matter what."" Below are highlights from our coverage of the agreement, compiled by the Canada audience growth editor, Lindsey Wiebe. — ""Good for Canada, good for Mexico,"" Mr. Trump said of the new trade agreement in remarks at the White House on Monday. As Alan reports, the updated Nafta is Mr. Trump's biggest trade achievement to date and comes after more than a year of intense negotiations. — Mr. Trudeau praised the new agreement as a win for Canada. But economists painted a more complex picture, writes our Toronto bureau chief, Catherine Porter. — There's a lot to digest in the revised pact: New rules for auto production, reduced barriers for American dairy farmers to sell cheese and milk in Canada, and a tribunal for resolving trade disputes, retained in spite of United States efforts to eliminate it. Our tax and economics reporter, Jim Tankersley, explains what's changed in the renegotiated agreement. — Mexico's incoming president Andrés Manuel López Obrador once had deep misgivings about Nafta. But hours after Canada joined the revised trade deal with Mexico and the United States, the president-elect welcomed news of the agreement. — Late last month, Catherine and Alan profiled two players at the center of negotiations: Ms. Freeland and Mr. Lighthizer. The two differ widely in their backgrounds, approaches and priorities, and those differences extended to how each came to the negotiating table. — Before the fraught relations and protracted negotiations, there was Canada's ill-fated charm offensive. Guy Lawson delved deeply into Mr. Trudeau's campaign against the American trade war for The Times Magazine in June."

President Joko Widodo declared a national emergency three days after an earthquake and tsunami devastated the island of Sulawesi. Rescue workers continue to dig out people trapped under the wreckage, but they have been hindered by a lack of heavy equipment. At least 844 people were killed, with the death toll widely expected to rise as rescuers make their way to more remote parts of the island. As many as 1,200 convicts escaped from local jails, and violent confrontations with looters have occurred. A word you might hear in the wake of this disaster is ""liquefaction"": when the ground, shaken by an earthquake, behaves like a liquid. Thousands of homes on Sulawesi have been swallowed. Here's a map of the damage. _____ • Spy story. A new book says that Sergei Skripal, the former Russian spy targeted in a nerve agent attack this spring, fed Britain's Secret Intelligence Service information about a 1990s-era corruption scheme that reached the top levels of the Kremlin. Above, Mr. Skripal at a Russian court hearing in 2016. The plot involved a leading Russian intelligence chief who is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, the book contends. _____  • Green light on Kavanaugh inquiry.  The White House authorized the F.B.I. to expand its abbreviated investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, by interviewing anyone it thinks is necessary as long as the review is finished by the end of the week. Judge Kavanaugh's angry response to the allegations at last week's Senate hearing has provided fodder for a new avenue of attack by Democrats seeking to derail his nomination. _____ • We're so very sorry. With rail passengers across Britain outraged by delays, train companies are mastering the fine art of apologizing. Since the start of the year, they have said ""sorry"" on Twitter 417,000 times. • The U.S., Canada and Mexico signed a revised version of the Nafta trade deal, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement. Among the changes: Canada will reduce import barriers for American dairy products, Canada and Mexico will be exempted from future auto tariffs, and Mexico will adopt more worker protections. • General Electric replaced its chief executive, John Flannery, who was brought on just over a year ago to turn the company around. He will be succeeded by H. Lawrence Culp Jr., former head of the Danaher Corporation.

News,2018-10-02,"Heart disease runs in Mackenzie Ames’s family. Her grandfather had a fatal heart attack at age 30 while dancing with her grandmother at the Elks Lodge in Bath, N.Y. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/health/pcsk9-cholesterol-prices.html,1561," Heart disease runs in Mackenzie Ames's family. Her grandfather had a fatal heart attack at age 30 while dancing with her grandmother at the Elks Lodge in Bath, N.Y.  Her mother had a quadruple bypass when she was 42. When Ms. Ames was just 9 years old, her LDL cholesterol level (the bad kind) was 400 mg/dL, about four times higher than it should have been. Diet and exercise did not help. Ms. Ames tried every cholesterol-lowering drug available, but nothing could get her LDL below 100 mg/dL. Her problem is a genetic condition, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (F.H.), that leads to high cholesterol levels and heart attacks at a young age. It affects 1.3 million Americans. In theory, there is a solution — a new class of drugs, called PCSK9 inhibitors, that slash cholesterol levels, reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes and save the lives of people like Ms. Ames, who lives in Raleigh, N.C. According to the Food and Drug Administration, patients with F.H. are eligible for the new drugs. But she can't get them. Two insurers have turned her down. ""I have followed every rule, and I still can't get access,"" Ms. Ames said. ""My doctor can't get a straight answer."" [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Like many similar patients, she has gotten caught in the crossfire of a marketplace battle between insurers, providers of prescription drugs and the makers of these drugs.  Drug companies gave the PCSK9 inhibitors exorbitant price tags — the list figure was as high as $14,600 per year, although payers generally negotiate much lower prices. But insurers balked at the costs and questioned the effectiveness of the new drugs.  Access is beginning to ease now, with some unusual new agreements between the manufacturers, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers who act as intermediaries. Still, these drugs offer a cautionary tale, even as pharmaceutical manufacturers bring to market costly new treatments for common diseases like migraine, nonalcoholic liver disease and severe dermatitis.  Unlike expensive drugs for cancers or rare inherited diseases, the PCSK9 inhibitors were aimed at large numbers of people — as many as 10 million Americans, a number that includes not just people with F.H. but also people with heart disease and stubbornly high cholesterol levels.  For the most part, few of those patients were able to get the medications. In one study, 80 percent of patients who tried to get the powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs were met with initial rejections by insurers; only 50 percent eventually received approval after appealing.  The drugs arrived just after what was called ""the hepatitis C debacle"" by Jalpa A. Doshi, a health economist at the University of Pennsylvania — the introduction of medications that cured the liver disease but cost $84,000 or more for a course of treatment.  Stunned by those costs, insurers and other payers ""were scanning the horizon to see what else was coming on the market,"" she said. The PCSK9 inhibitors, they learned, could cost the nation anywhere from $21 billion to $113 billion a year.  And unlike hepatitis C medications, the new cholesterol-lowering drugs would be taken for a lifetime.  ""The science behind these drugs is astonishing, but the price is also astonishing,"" said Dr. Steven Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the United States. (It is being acquired by Cigna, the health insurer.) Until recently, there were no studies showing the drugs did anything except lower cholesterol levels, Dr. Miller added. Payers resisted in part because the manufacturers needed to show that PCSK9 inhibitors also prevented heart attacks and strokes and saved lives.  And given the expense, doctors needed to show that patients really needed these powerful drugs and not cheaper alternatives. ""Statins cost around $250 a year,"" Dr. Miller said.  Dr. Michael Sherman, chief medical officer at Harvard Pilgrim, which provides health insurance plans, echoed those concerns.  ""People get very angry when their deductibles go up, or when their premium or cost share goes up,"" Dr. Sherman said. But the price of expensive drugs ""is coming out of somewhere."" The companies that make the drugs, Amgen and Regeneron, note the list price of drugs is always higher than the price insurers agree to pay. Regeneron, the first to market (in collaboration with Sanofi), set its list price to allow for substantial discounting when its competitor, Amgen, got its drug approved, a spokeswoman said.  As for Amgen, whose drug was the second PCSK9 inhibitor to be approved, the drug's price ""was set to be competitive within a complex health care system,"" said Tony Hooper, Amgen's executive vice president. Both companies say they deplore the subsequent lack of access to their drugs. Insurers insisted doctors fill out pre-authorization forms describing why their patients needed the drugs, Dr. Doshi said. The practice is not unusual for expensive treatments — but in the case of PCSK9 drugs, the forms tended to be byzantine, inordinately long and complicated.  And while pre-authorization forms for most other drugs require only the doctor's verification of a patient's medical history, the PCSK9 inhibitor forms usually required proof, including long medical records that often had to be faxed.  Skittish insurers have denied patients without clear reason, or asked for additional data that were unavailable, said Dr. Leslie Cho, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. Some insurers, for example, ""require inordinate testing or documentation,"" she said. ""They might want to know every statin you ever tried, or force you to try statins that make no sense, like trying simvastatin when you have already tried three other statins."" Insurers had asked for documentation of cholesterol levels when the patient was not taking statins. But many had been taking statins for years and had changed doctors several times in the interim. That kind of documentation could be impossible to find. After a doctor applied for a patient to get the drugs, it could take weeks for insurers to issue a denial, and then the doctor had to resubmit the form to appeal.  Some insurers approved a PCSK9 inhibitor for a patient but then cut off the supply after three months, asking for another pre-authorization request. Doctors often say they have neither the time nor the perseverance to try to get the drugs for their patients.  Insurers would rather not cover such expensive patients, said Ron Howrigon, a former executive at Kaiser Permanente and other health insurers. Patients who need PCSK9 inhibitors are already at high risk for heart attacks and strokes, he noted, and their care can be expensive.  If one insurer puts up enough barriers, patients may switch to another — and even change jobs — to get a drug that they believe might be lifesaving, added Mr. Howrigon, who now heads Fulcrum Strategies, a company that advises doctors on running their practices.  For patients and their doctors, all this marketplace maneuvering is maddening and frustrating. But there are signs that some of the barriers are beginning to fall.  Citing recent data showing Regeneron's PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, saves lives, Express Scripts recently made a deal with the drug's makers.  Regeneron and Sanofi cut the price to Express Scripts. In return, Express Scripts made Praluent the only PCSK9 inhibitor it will provide to patients whose prescriptions it fills. Express Scripts also said it would greatly simplify its pre-authorization forms for the drug.  Harvard Pilgrim struck a different deal. Amgen is reducing its price to Harvard Pilgrim — and will refund the cost of its drug, Repatha, for any patient taking it who goes on to have a heart attack or stroke. In return, Harvard Pilgrim also simplified its pre-authorization forms. Amgen has 20 more deals nearing completion like the one Regeneron and Sanofi made with Express Scripts, and officials claim that access for patients with commercial insurance has improved by 33 percent.  Still, many patients and doctors are struggling to lay hands on the drugs. At the Cleveland Clinic, ""we had to hire a couple of people to navigate all the paperwork,"" said Dr. Cho.  They succeed only with extensive documentation of every lab test, every drug, the patient has had. Even in the best circumstances, Dr. Cho said, ""it takes four to six weeks to get an approval.""  ""The problem is that there are certain insurance companies and certain groups that require inordinate testing or documentation,"" she added. And while her group has had some success with appeals, ""once you get denied, it is very hard."" Then there are those patients who finally got the drugs only to see them snatched away. Rodney Scheidel, a 58-year-old Medicaid beneficiary in New Orleans, has diabetes, severe heart disease and an LDL level of 160 mg/dL. With his condition, the figure should be closer to 70 mg/dL.  He cannot tolerate statins, said Dr. Keith Ferdinand, a cardiologist at Tulane Medical Center. ""He meets all the criteria"" for a PCSK9 inhibitor, Dr. Ferdinand added.  He managed to get a PCSK9 inhibitor for Mr. Scheidel. After three months, Medicaid cut him off and asked Dr. Ferdinand to reapply for the drug and to document Mr. Scheidel's LDL level to show the drug was working.  ""That is crazy,"" Dr. Ferdinand said. ""There is no medical guideline that I know of that says if you had an effective therapy you would stop it and show again that it works.""  Now that Mr. Scheidel has stopped taking his drug, his cholesterol level will rise again, which could be interpreted as showing the drug did not work. ""It's been an uphill fight all the way,"" Mr. Scheidel said. Dr. Ferdinand had the same reaction. ""They make these decisions completely arbitrarily,"" he said."
Interactive Feature,2018-10-02,"The midterm elections are around the corner. If you haven’t been keeping up with what’s going on, or have been and are still confused, take a look at our cheat sheet.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/2018-midterm-election-guide.html,0," Heart disease runs in Mackenzie Ames's family. Her grandfather had a fatal heart attack at age 30 while dancing with her grandmother at the Elks Lodge in Bath, N.Y.  Her mother had a quadruple bypass when she was 42. When Ms. Ames was just 9 years old, her LDL cholesterol level (the bad kind) was 400 mg/dL, about four times higher than it should have been. Diet and exercise did not help. Ms. Ames tried every cholesterol-lowering drug available, but nothing could get her LDL below 100 mg/dL. Her problem is a genetic condition, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (F.H.), that leads to high cholesterol levels and heart attacks at a young age. It affects 1.3 million Americans. In theory, there is a solution — a new class of drugs, called PCSK9 inhibitors, that slash cholesterol levels, reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes and save the lives of people like Ms. Ames, who lives in Raleigh, N.C. According to the Food and Drug Administration, patients with F.H. are eligible for the new drugs. But she can't get them. Two insurers have turned her down. ""I have followed every rule, and I still can't get access,"" Ms. Ames said. ""My doctor can't get a straight answer."" [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Like many similar patients, she has gotten caught in the crossfire of a marketplace battle between insurers, providers of prescription drugs and the makers of these drugs.  Drug companies gave the PCSK9 inhibitors exorbitant price tags — the list figure was as high as $14,600 per year, although payers generally negotiate much lower prices. But insurers balked at the costs and questioned the effectiveness of the new drugs.  Access is beginning to ease now, with some unusual new agreements between the manufacturers, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers who act as intermediaries. Still, these drugs offer a cautionary tale, even as pharmaceutical manufacturers bring to market costly new treatments for common diseases like migraine, nonalcoholic liver disease and severe dermatitis.  Unlike expensive drugs for cancers or rare inherited diseases, the PCSK9 inhibitors were aimed at large numbers of people — as many as 10 million Americans, a number that includes not just people with F.H. but also people with heart disease and stubbornly high cholesterol levels.  For the most part, few of those patients were able to get the medications. In one study, 80 percent of patients who tried to get the powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs were met with initial rejections by insurers; only 50 percent eventually received approval after appealing.  The drugs arrived just after what was called ""the hepatitis C debacle"" by Jalpa A. Doshi, a health economist at the University of Pennsylvania — the introduction of medications that cured the liver disease but cost $84,000 or more for a course of treatment.  Stunned by those costs, insurers and other payers ""were scanning the horizon to see what else was coming on the market,"" she said. The PCSK9 inhibitors, they learned, could cost the nation anywhere from $21 billion to $113 billion a year.  And unlike hepatitis C medications, the new cholesterol-lowering drugs would be taken for a lifetime.  ""The science behind these drugs is astonishing, but the price is also astonishing,"" said Dr. Steven Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the United States. (It is being acquired by Cigna, the health insurer.) Until recently, there were no studies showing the drugs did anything except lower cholesterol levels, Dr. Miller added. Payers resisted in part because the manufacturers needed to show that PCSK9 inhibitors also prevented heart attacks and strokes and saved lives.  And given the expense, doctors needed to show that patients really needed these powerful drugs and not cheaper alternatives. ""Statins cost around $250 a year,"" Dr. Miller said.  Dr. Michael Sherman, chief medical officer at Harvard Pilgrim, which provides health insurance plans, echoed those concerns.  ""People get very angry when their deductibles go up, or when their premium or cost share goes up,"" Dr. Sherman said. But the price of expensive drugs ""is coming out of somewhere."" The companies that make the drugs, Amgen and Regeneron, note the list price of drugs is always higher than the price insurers agree to pay. Regeneron, the first to market (in collaboration with Sanofi), set its list price to allow for substantial discounting when its competitor, Amgen, got its drug approved, a spokeswoman said.  As for Amgen, whose drug was the second PCSK9 inhibitor to be approved, the drug's price ""was set to be competitive within a complex health care system,"" said Tony Hooper, Amgen's executive vice president. Both companies say they deplore the subsequent lack of access to their drugs. Insurers insisted doctors fill out pre-authorization forms describing why their patients needed the drugs, Dr. Doshi said. The practice is not unusual for expensive treatments — but in the case of PCSK9 drugs, the forms tended to be byzantine, inordinately long and complicated.  And while pre-authorization forms for most other drugs require only the doctor's verification of a patient's medical history, the PCSK9 inhibitor forms usually required proof, including long medical records that often had to be faxed.  Skittish insurers have denied patients without clear reason, or asked for additional data that were unavailable, said Dr. Leslie Cho, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. Some insurers, for example, ""require inordinate testing or documentation,"" she said. ""They might want to know every statin you ever tried, or force you to try statins that make no sense, like trying simvastatin when you have already tried three other statins."" Insurers had asked for documentation of cholesterol levels when the patient was not taking statins. But many had been taking statins for years and had changed doctors several times in the interim. That kind of documentation could be impossible to find. After a doctor applied for a patient to get the drugs, it could take weeks for insurers to issue a denial, and then the doctor had to resubmit the form to appeal.  Some insurers approved a PCSK9 inhibitor for a patient but then cut off the supply after three months, asking for another pre-authorization request. Doctors often say they have neither the time nor the perseverance to try to get the drugs for their patients.  Insurers would rather not cover such expensive patients, said Ron Howrigon, a former executive at Kaiser Permanente and other health insurers. Patients who need PCSK9 inhibitors are already at high risk for heart attacks and strokes, he noted, and their care can be expensive.  If one insurer puts up enough barriers, patients may switch to another — and even change jobs — to get a drug that they believe might be lifesaving, added Mr. Howrigon, who now heads Fulcrum Strategies, a company that advises doctors on running their practices.  For patients and their doctors, all this marketplace maneuvering is maddening and frustrating. But there are signs that some of the barriers are beginning to fall.  Citing recent data showing Regeneron's PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, saves lives, Express Scripts recently made a deal with the drug's makers.  Regeneron and Sanofi cut the price to Express Scripts. In return, Express Scripts made Praluent the only PCSK9 inhibitor it will provide to patients whose prescriptions it fills. Express Scripts also said it would greatly simplify its pre-authorization forms for the drug.  Harvard Pilgrim struck a different deal. Amgen is reducing its price to Harvard Pilgrim — and will refund the cost of its drug, Repatha, for any patient taking it who goes on to have a heart attack or stroke. In return, Harvard Pilgrim also simplified its pre-authorization forms. Amgen has 20 more deals nearing completion like the one Regeneron and Sanofi made with Express Scripts, and officials claim that access for patients with commercial insurance has improved by 33 percent.

News,2018-10-02,"When it launched in 2012, Uber’s original stance on tipping drivers was that it would make using the app more of a hassle for drivers and passengers. “In the end, we decided against including one because we felt it would be better for riders and drivers to know for sure what they would pay or earn on each trip — without the uncertainty of tipping,” the company wrote in a 2016 blog post in response to two class-action lawsuits.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/travel/should-you-tip-your-uber-driver-if-so-how-much.html,753," When it launched in 2012, Uber's original stance on tipping drivers was that it would make using the app more of a hassle for drivers and passengers. ""In the end, we decided against including one because we felt it would be better for riders and drivers to know for sure what they would pay or earn on each trip — without the uncertainty of tipping,"" the company wrote in a 2016 blog post in response to two class-action lawsuits. After public pressure and complaints from drivers, Uber ultimately decided to change its policy in July 2017. Competing apps like Lyft had launched by that time with the option built-in, and Via and Juno also allow riders to tip their drivers. Brett Helling is a former Uber driver who now owns and runs Ridester.com, a resource for drivers. Mr. Helling said he tips drivers between 10 and 20 percent the cost of the trip, based on the level of service. Julia Boyd, an international etiquette consultant, agreed. For U.S. rides, she recommends tipping between 15 and 20 percent for exceptional service, 10 to 15 for good service, and 10 percent for average service.  ""Many Uber trips can be more expensive than a standard cab. However, a standard cab offers a standard service. Uber drivers will often have exceptionally clean cars and fresh water for their passengers,"" Ms. Boyd said. According to Mr. Helling's data, passengers who do tip only leave an average of 5.5 percent. The ride-sharing app Via suggests leaving drivers 15 to 20 percent.  ""With fares, tips, and bonuses factored in, I average around $20 an hour and give around 75 rides per week,"" said Jon Sycamore, a driver in Salt Lake City who also runs a real estate business. ""If you remove tips, it drops to around $15 an hour."" By comparison, Salt Lake City's living wage is $11.48 an hour for a single adult and $24.12 an hour for a single adult with a child.  Surveying more than 2,600 active Uber drivers, Mr. Helling found that the average median hourly income for UberX drivers, who made up 74.7 percent of respondents, was $13.70 an hour, not including tips. The average was slightly higher for Uber XL drivers, who earned $14.84 an hour.  Why not include tips in the survey? ""That's because tip income was negligible in the majority of cases,"" Mr. Helling said. Half of the surveyed drivers' tips were less than $5. Over a third of the surveyed drivers didn't earn any tips at all.  Mr. Sycamore said he averages $1.26 in tips from Uber riders and 86 cents from Lyft riders. Based on his last 77 rides with each service, less than half of passengers tipped. ""Based on our findings, Uber riders are still very set in Uber's old no-tipping policy,"" Mr. Helling said. ""Drivers are paying for their own vehicle, which comes with its own slew of expenses. A dollar or two on every ride really adds up, offsetting the high cost of operating the vehicle."" For Ms. Boyd, it makes sense to tip your driver because they are providing a personal service which involves safety and comfort, and our cultural norm is to tip those who provide this kind of service. She pointed out that this norm will vary in overseas markets. ""In Europe the tipping expectations would be lower, and many passengers would simply 'round up' the bill. And don't even think about tipping any driver in Japan — that would be considered rude,"" she said. Both Uber and Lyft limit their tip amount to 200 percent. So you wouldn't be able to leave a $15 tip for your $5 Uber ride if you were feeling extra generous — at least not on the app. The companies put a ceiling on this to keep passengers from accidentally adding an extra zero and overtipping. Whether you give your driver cash or just tip through the app, they receive 100 percent of the tip; Uber, Lyft, Gett and Via don't take a cut. Generally, drivers are just happy to get a tip, Mr. Helling said, and many don't have a preference for cash versus tipping directly in the app. Still, if you have the cash on hand, it can't hurt to ask. Correction: 10/3/2018An earlier version of this article said that Juno passengers could only tip if they gave drivers a five-star rating. Juno changed this policy in September 2016, and now passengers can tip regardless of the rating they give their driver."

Because of injuries, Mr. Murray, one of the fabled Big 4, had to skip the Australian and French Opens, as well as Wimbledon. And when the former No. 1 did play the U.S. Open in August, he did so as the 382nd-ranked player in the world and lost in the second round. But outside of tennis, life seems good for the three-time Grand Slam winner and the holder of two Olympic gold medals. Mr. Murray, 31, has two young daughters, both under the age of three, with his wife, Kim. He runs a management company to mentor young tennis players, many of whom are British. He owns a five-star hotel named Cromlix not far from his hometown of Dunblane, Scotland, on an estate that used to belong to senior figures in the church during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. He also travels regularly, documenting his journeys on Instagram for his 1.5 million followers. ""As you get older, you come closer toward the end of your career, you realize how much you love what you are doing and how lucky you've been to travel around the world and go to these amazing cities and play tennis in front of these huge enthusiastic crowds,"" he said. ""When I was younger, I had so much pressure and stress on myself, I couldn't enjoy the moment as much as I should have. Now that I'm older, I've appreciated it.""  Mr. Murray was certainly relaxed when I caught up with him at the Langham Hotel in New York two days before this year's U.S. Open began. He was playing Ping-Pong with his brother Jamie Murray and excited about his dinner that evening at Zuma, a modern Japanese restaurant in midtown. Here is an edited version of our conversation:  You've always said you love New York because you've had some of your biggest tennis moments here. In 2004 you won the junior U.S. Open. In 2012, you won your first Grand Slam here, beating Novak Djokovic in five sets.  I loved coming here as a junior. We didn't get to stay in a hotel as nice as the Langham, but we got to play at the big courts at Flushing Meadows. I remember watching the women's finals there. I sat right up at the top, because it was the only place I could get tickets. After seeing that, I always wanted to come play matches here as a professional.  When I won the U.S. Open, my first grand slam, I was so unbelievably nervous. I didn't want to go on the court. But I managed to win after 4 hours and 54 minutes. When I saw my coach I expected smiles or maybe a well-done, but he said, ""I don't think you played particularly well. We've got lots to work on. Give me a call tomorrow, and we'll chat about it. Enjoy tonight."" And that was it.  Now when you travel, you have your two daughters with you. What is it like traveling with them?  It's great that they are here. We just need to have slightly bigger rooms now. Sometimes the matches finish at 2 a.m., so I need to make sure I have my own room to sleep in.  When I used to come to New York, we would go out in the evening and watch shows and see all the restaurants. Now we spend a lot more time going to parks. We went to Central Park two days ago for a good couple of hours. We found this playground with a nice sand pit with climbing things and slides. It was great. No one recognized me there. You must spend so much of your life staying in hotels. Why did you want to own one of your own? We've got a little bit of family history to the hotel. My brother got married there, and my gran and grandfather had their 40th wedding anniversary there. It was about a year or 18 months after my brother got married when my mom called me and said the hotel is on the market, the business is gone, it needs a lot of renovation and work. It was one of those ""should we, should we not"" things. I spoke to a couple of people who I work with who said it was going to be really tough, a big investment and quite a big risk. But I thought it could be really cool and something that is really important to me. I'm really happy we did it at the end. It's done really well, and I get to visit a few times a year and enjoy it.  What recommendations do you have for visitors coming there?  The scenery in that part of Scotland is great. You can go for walks and hikes. A lot of people come to visit because there are really great golf courses around there as well. I personally don't hike because of my hip, but when we were kids, when we lived there we always grew up with a dog, and we used to walk dogs around there. This summer you've started using Instagram more on your travels, posting personal snapshots of you riding roller coasters at Kings Island, amusement park in Mason, Ohio, and visiting the United Nations in New York City. Why do you feel so comfortable sharing on Instagram?  I used to do Twitter a lot more, and Twitter is quite a brutal place to be sometimes. You have to be careful on Twitter, but I enjoy Instagram a lot. It's fun; I'm quite a visual personal myself. I'm not a huge reader; I like watching documentaries and movies. I also learn visually, so it's nice. It's interesting because the more that I post stuff, the more people come up to me and say, ""I follow your Instagram."" The last three or four weeks, people have come up to me and said, ""We enjoy it; you have to keep doing it."" "

This dispatch brings her to two places: Bologna, the capital of Emilia-Romagna, which took the No. 40 spot on the list; and Matera, a city in Basilicata, which took the No. 3 spot. They are the 37th and 38th stops on Jada's itinerary. ""You know the word decumano?"" asked Armando Comi, a friend of a friend I had just met at a small bistro near his apartment in Bologna's medieval city center. In an ancient Roman city like this one, he explained as we downed Campari and sodas, a decumano (Decumanus Maximus in Latin) was the most important street, where all business took place. In the daytime, at least. To truly understand Bologna, though, you need to go to the bustling, tiny Via del Pratello, one block from the decumano (the grand Via San Felice). It's where we were sitting, downing Campari and sodas, and envisioning night life here centuries ago. ""Imagine just alcohol and prostitution, basically,"" Armando said.  He loved using the word ""imagine"" as he showed me around his city. ""Imagine that just 10 years ago this was a street just for a little slice of pizza and kebabs,"" he said, marveling at the teeming outdoor cafes. Imagine, he went on, being a student in the 11th century at the University of Bologna, the oldest in the Western world, or during the 1950s, '60s and '70s, when Bologna was the most left-wing city in Italy, and producing the country's most iconic pop musicians.  ""Imagine Bologna from the eyes of someone who came from a really provincial situation as in the south of Italy where you find nothing interesting,"" he said. Armando is from Calabria and has lived in Bologna for 20 years. ""You come here because it is not a city, it is a legend."" I soon learned that Armando writes historical thrillers using research he had done on heretical religious movements while earning his doctorate in history of philosophy at the University of Bologna.  New Campari and sodas appeared at our table, courtesy of Armando's friend Francesco Bianchini. He's an assistant professor of philosophy of science at the university and appeared to be about seven feet tall with glasses and an inviting grin. He spun the picture of arriving to Bologna from small-town central Italy as a student in the '90s, when it was both the country's hip cultural capital — and home to the notorious criminal gang, the Banda della Uno Bianca in which police officers, driving white Fiat Uno cars, went on a multi-year crime spree. ""How much time can you spend with us?"" Francesco wanted to know. I was open, I said. I'd been waiting all week to see how the Bolognese spend their Saturday nights. ""That's a little dangerous,"" said Francesco, predicting we'd be out until the wee hours, hopping from pub to restaurant to bar to hole-in-the-wall-snack spot, surrounded by others doing the same thing. Such is what happens when you have 100,000 students in a city with 500,000 citizens, many of them former students. Everyone talks about the food in Bologna, capital of the region of Emilia-Romagna (the entirety of which was on the 52 Places list). This is the land that brought you balsamic vinegar and ragù Bolognese. But what gets lost in Instagram filters is the kind of rebel spirit you feel on the ground: the intensity it takes to achieve simplicity and craftsmanship; the discourse on history and religion and relationships and vices that leaves you buzzing long after a delicious meal. This region's greatest product might be its endless stream of maniac geniuses. My mad geniuses were now leading me across the incredible Piazza Maggiore to Bologna's oldest pub, Osteria del Sole, around since 1465. It doesn't serve food these days, but does have convivial low ceilings and long tables, and serves its own brand of wine for 2 euros, or about $2.30, a glass. After a scary brush with foreclosure, the place has cleaned up a bit — no more sawdust on the floor — but the prices have stayed about the same, Francesco said. Dinner was a nice long walk under Bologna's many porticos to Osteria da Mario, founded in 1900. ""This restaurant, once it was just an old man named Mario with a lot of salumi and a knife and a lot of wine,"" said Armando, wistfully recounting Mario's gruff demeanor. Now it's a hip gastro pub with white tablecloths and a backlit bar and caricatures of dearly departed Mario lining every wall. We paid tribute to him with an antipasto plate — prosciutto di Parma, mortadella — paired with incredibly creamy cheeses. And a lot of wine. You might sense a theme to our night. Like so many other places in Bologna's city center, Francesco said, Osteria da Mario has had to compromise, transform into a modern version of a traditional osteria, to keep up with tourism. High-speed trains, and a location in the center of the country, along with draws like the newly opened FICO Eataly World (a giant mall for eating and learning about Italy's food production), have made this city a regional hub. The students who congregated nightly in piazzas have been forced to move outside the city wall, replaced with temporary visitors like me, heading to Airbnb with their roller suitcases click-clacking on cobblestone streets. That rebel spirit, though, still persists. We found it at Mercato delle Erbe, a food market by day that fills with mostly crowds of residents at drink stands by night, and while nursing negronis next to a Fidel Castro poster at Osteria del Montesino, and also while munching on fried Sardinian street food after one last, ill-advised glass of grappa. I'd been charmed by Bologna earlier in my trip, the pink buildings that glowed even pinker at sunset. The pace of living that seemed so slow and unforced. But with Armando and Francesco that night, I felt like I was seeing it for the first time. Did you know that those porticos were a genius way of expanding the city's housing stock — building apartments on top of the porticos — without losing sidewalk space? Or that you can find three arrows stuck in the roof of a portico on Strada Maggiore from a robbery gone wrong? Or that there's a canal in the middle of town if you just know where to find the right window to peer upon it? That night, Bologna felt like home, with endless surprises. But maybe that was the negronis talking. Luggage still in hand, two minutes after arriving in one of the oldest sectors of the ancient southern Italian city of Matera, I wandered onto a viewpoint balcony near the main square of Piazza Vittorio Veneto and into utter awe. Below me and before me were tiers upon tiers of buildings in pale gold and white stone, leading to a valley of more pale stone, and another steep hill in the distance filled with tier upon tier of the same. It felt like looking at a city on the moon, or standing on the world's largest wedding cake. The sheer feat of human endeavor that had created this gleaming expanse was overwhelming. I was shocked to find out it has never been used as a shooting location for the ""Star Wars"" universe. But it has been a double for ancient Jerusalem in many a biblical movie, including Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" which filmed here in 2004, and is credited for being a major factor in boosting the city's tourism profile. At the moment, though, I had more pressing things to think about, namely if I was going to have to sleep on that balcony. Matera lies in the far south region of Basilicata, at the arch of Italy's boot. Getting there had been so logistically exhausting — a four-hour, delayed train trip from Bologna, to an overnight pit stop in Salerno (the southern entrance to the Amalfi Coast), to a three-hour bus ride at 5 a.m. — that I was almost there, on a bus without Wi-Fi or cell signal, when I realized I'd neglected to book a place to stay. If there's one overarching lesson from my time in that beautiful, economically challenged city, though, it's that Matera takes care of people. It hit me when I was in a cellphone store buying a SIM card and a woman overheard my housing dilemma, called her cousin Simona, who owns a bed-and-breakfast, and within 10 minutes I had a room at one of the most charming places I've stayed at on this entire trip. Simona's B&B, Hoplites, was exactly where you want to be, in one of two Sassi, or rock districts, of Matera's Unesco World Heritage-protected old towns. Both Sasso Barisano and the even older Sasso Caveoso began as cave dwellings; the city has been occupied since 7,000 B.C. To get to Hoplites, in Sasso Barisano, I dragged my bags up and down cobblestone hills.  Simona, a woman in her early 30s who speaks little English, greeted my arrival with cheek kisses. I got a two-story apartment to myself, with a private roof overlooking all of Sasso Barisano for 70 euros a night. The other rooms are in refurbished caves, as are most lodging options in the Sassi. The shower in at least one of Simona's rooms is built into a former Roman grain silo from many years before Christ. Simona, her husband, her father and her mother, all of whom I met over breakfast (her mother makes homemade cake for the guests) spent three years turning fetid, pitch-black caves into cozy, white-painted havens. Later in my stay, I moved to a fancy boutique hotel, La Casa di Lucio, for the chance to stay in a cave, which was painted all white and had a leopard print couch, and was just as fabulous as it sounds.  Anyone in Matera can tell you the story of how far the city has had to come to be a place that has things like bed-and-breakfasts and hotels; I strongly encourage making Casa Noha, an interactive museum, your first stop, to hear about the city in dramatic narration with visuals. Matera was once the capital of Basilicata, but a move of the capital to Potenza, and the funds that came with that, began a long descent into poverty. Up until the 1950s, families with six or more children still lived in caves in the Sassi, along with their livestock, and without electricity, running water or sewers. Politics, but also the urgency of a 50 percent infant mortality rate, led to the relocation of the Sassi's 15,000 citizens to nearby modern communities. The Sassi were empty for 30 years, well into the 1980s, but its citizens never abandoned them. A group of young, untrained citizen archaeologists documented its cave churches with their priceless Byzantine frescoes — and then those culture preservers became politicians and began cleaning up the Sassi. Unesco designation came in the 1990s, as did government programs to practically give away caves to anyone who'd renovate them. Next year Matera is going to be a European Capital of Culture, with a year of celebratory events and an influx of funds for renewal projects.  I had arrived in Matera with grand ambitions to explore the Basilicata countryside, but soon found myself too engrossed to want to go anywhere else. That, and getting myself up and down Matera's pedestrian-only streets proved so tiring I couldn't even fathom how I'd get to a car rental. Every walk that Google Maps told me was going to take five minutes took at least 30, since that app does not account for hills. Or for an entire city being white. Wrong turns led to other wrong turns. But I was too busy taking pictures and gawking at every vista to be bothered.  Finding restaurants, too, proved to be a challenge. By the end of my five-day stay, I had gone to two, the cave bistro Osteria Al Casale, and a modest cafe, L'Arturo Enogastronomia, which had delicious small plates, Wi-Fi and the advantage of being one of the few places in town I knew how to find on a regular basis. Slowing down, too, allowed for relationships to blossom, which, in the end, is where Matera's true magic lies. On my first night, I met a photographer, Cosimo Martemucci, who was born and raised here, and, over two incredible evenings, showed me the visual playground — such as the hilltop cave church Chiesa Madonna della Idris — where he learned his trade.  The most magical evening of all, though, might have been when an art restorer named Angelica Malizia took me across a canyon — Le Gravine di Matera — to a lookout called Belvedere in Parco di Murgia Timone for a complete view of the city with all its lights. We had come with her friend, Mariangela Fugliuolo, a tour guide, and their two boyfriends, Alessandro and Marcello, delightful jokesters both. After taking in the view, we sat at tables near the visitor's center, picnicking with wine we'd brought and a local delicacy called panzerotto, similar to a calzone, that we'd picked up on our way out of the city at a fast-food bar called Sottozero. Marcello helps run an outdoor film festival at the visitor's center in the summer, and the five of us talked politics and romance and our favorite movies for hours.  In a few months, the cultural capital events would begin and the whole city might change, but I felt grateful to have had this night, and the kind of warm Matera welcome I hope will last for eons to come. See Bologna has an emotional statue of Jesus's death at Santa Maria della Vita church, and the fascinating San Stefano, an unfinished complex of seven churches. But the real sightseeing thrill is Le Due Torri (The Two Towers), the taller of which, Asinelli, offers a panoramic view of Bologna in all its pink-stoned glory to anyone willing and able to climb 498 steps.  The most eye-opening attraction I saw in Matera was Casa Grotta di Via Solitario, which recreates a furnished cave, complete with a horse near the bed.  Eat Try the tortellini in brodo at Trattoria del Rosso, where Francesco took me for lunch. Bologna is where the modern gelato machine was invented and the city is awash with options: Sorbetteria Castiglione, Gelateria Galleria 49, Gelateria Delle Moline, and Cremeria Cavour to name a few. Down south, make sure you try the pane di Matera, a slow-baked bread with a recipe so old it has an archaeological designation. I tried mine dipped in homemade tapenades at the office of Matera City Tour. The rosé wines of the region are also surprisingly dry and delicious.

briefing,2018-10-02, (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/briefing/brett-kavanaugh-indonesia-mlb-playoffs.html,1286,"  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)  Good morning. Here's what you need to know: As an undergraduate at Yale in 1985, Mr. Kavanaugh was accused of throwing ice on another man during a bar fight, and he and four others were questioned by the police. The events, described in a police report obtained by The Times, are unrelated to the F.B.I.'s investigation of sexual assault allegations against Mr. Kavanaugh. President Trump said he had told the agency to expand that inquiry and interview anyone necessary. Some Democrats hoping to derail the judge's Supreme Court nomination are using his performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee as a new line of attack, questioning his temperament and truthfulness. • The witnesses: Read our guide to who the F.B.I. has interviewed (and who it has not). Days after an earthquake and tsunami that killed over 1,200 people, survivors in the Indonesian city of Palu were growing increasingly desperate as rescue efforts faltered. Some attempted to clear rubble by hand to free those trapped under debris. Others begged for food aid, while the police were distracted by looting. Officials said that the damage was so devastating partly because of ""liquefaction,"" in which soil flows like water after a quake. Our video shows the process in action. • Mapping the destruction: See the scale of the damage. President Trump hailed the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, saying the new pact would pour ""cash and jobs"" into the United States. Mexico said it welcomed the breakthrough, while Canadians seemed mostly relieved that the country would avoid crippling auto tariffs. But the deal sets up a potential showdown with China as Mr. Trump narrows his trade war to a single front. • The changes: Here's our guide to how the revised agreement will affect automakers, dairy farmers, labor unions and large corporations. The suicides of six professional drivers in New York in the last year prompted a flurry of legislation to address the collapse of the industry and the impact on its workers. We spoke with some cabbies to gain an insight into the despair that many feel about their finances and about their prospects of being able to retire. • The fear: ""When I hear that somebody did suicide, I was thinking about me,"" one driver said. ""I'm going to be one of them one day."" Arthur Ashkin, Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland were awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics today for their work in using light to make miniature tools. • The I.R.S. is pursuing  fewer cases of tax evasion than it did less than 10 years ago. Repeated budget cuts by Congress and a shift in priorities have been blamed. • General Electric replaced John Flannery as its chief executive. He was brought in just over a year ago to lead a turnaround of the company, but it is still facing problems. • A surging inmate population in the 1980s led to a boom in for-profit prisons. Our documentary series Retro Report examines how a key function of the centers has become detaining undocumented immigrants for the government. • Amazon said today that it would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour for all its U.S. workers, including part-time employees and those hired through temporary agencies. • U.S. stocks were mixed on Monday. Here's a snapshot of global markets today. Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Life after college is weird. This can help. • Want to see brilliant fall colors? Here are eight getaways in the U.S. and abroad. • Recipe of the day: Caramelized onions make a magnificent spicy spaghetti. • How places shape people for life New maps of nearly every U.S. neighborhood show how location can lift children out of poverty, or trap them there. • Eye on 2020, but shadowed by 1991 Joe Biden is weighing a presidential run. But his role during the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings 27 years ago is complicating his status as a leader in the Democratic Party. And the midterm elections are in 34 days. Here's everything you need to know. • The road to the World Series The baseball postseason starts tonight with a wild-card game between the Chicago Cubs and the Colorado Rockies. The winner will play the Milwaukee Brewers. • Louis C.K. returns, again The comedian made another unexpected appearance at the Comedy Cellar in New York, his second performance since he admitted last year to inappropriate conduct. • A potential lifesaver that's hard to get A new cholesterol drug was supposed to revolutionize care for cardiac patients. But insurers and other payers have balked at prices. Here's more from this week's Science section. • In memoriam Charles Aznavour was an enduring French singer of global fame, as well as a composer, film star and champion of the Armenian people. He was 94. • Best of late-night TV Seth Meyers criticized President Trump for initially trying to limit the Kavanaugh investigation. ""There's not a single Sherlock Holmes novel called, 'Sherlock Holmes and the Actually, That's Not Important, Don't Look at That.'"" • Quotation of the day ""Normally your jaw is pretty resilient, but it just shatters like glass when it's hit by a high-velocity bullet. The actual injury only takes fractions of a second to occur, but it's a lifetime of rehabilitation."" — Dr. Steven Saxe, an oral surgeon who treated seven patients after the mass shooting in Las Vegas last year. • The Times, in other words Here's an image of today's front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. • What we're reading Our reporter Anahad O'Connor recommends this post on the Venture Valkyrie blog: ""This is so good and makes so much sense. We talk about nutrition, exercise, smoking, alcohol and even sleep when it comes to heart disease. But the role of emotional trauma and difficult childhood experiences are rarely discussed. Yet studies show they're a huge risk factor."" There are good little bunnies like Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail. And then there's Peter Rabbit. The first book in the classic series by the English writer Beatrix Potter was published on this day in 1902. ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit"" began as a letter Potter wrote in 1893 to a sick 5-year-old, with illustrations. Publishers turned it down but reversed themselves after Potter's self-published version proved enchanting. It has sold more than 45 million copies, been translated into 36 languages and recently became a film. First editions have sold for more than $50,000. With her earnings from the series, Potter bought Hill Top Farm in England's scenic Lake District, where, as a child, she had nurtured her love of nature drawings. (You can still visit.) Over the years, Potter turned her attention to farming and conservation, buying land and winning prizes for sheep breeding. She also worked closely with Britain's National Trust, which received 4,000 acres of land and 14 farms upon her death in 1943. A 1979 Times article cited a Potter biographer who wrote that she ""loved the lakes and saw only too clearly how hideously they were threatened by the exploiter and the jerrybuilder.""

News,2018-10-02,Good Tuesday. Want this by email? Sign up here.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/business/dealbook/board-equality-california.html,1728," Good Tuesday. Want this by email? Sign up here. The Golden State hopes to increase the number of women sitting on corporate boards by requiring companies based there to meet a quota for female directors. It's a worthy goal, but Andrew worries that this is the wrong approach. Why? California's legislature concedes that the law could be unconstitutional. Its requirements may not apply to companies chartered elsewhere. (A big loophole: By one estimate, the only Fortune 500 company affected is Apple.) And sudden disruption could hurt companies' performance. Joe Grundfest of Stanford, a longtime advocate for increasing board diversity, said of the move, ""I fear the cure is worse than the disease."" Andrew's suggestion? Individual investors, big and small, pressing boards to diversify: Firms like BlackRock and pension funds like Calpers, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, are already working to effect change. BlackRock has told companies that it wants to see at least two female board members at the companies it invests in. Calpers wrote to 504 companies in 2017 asking them to improve diversity, and has voted against directors at companies that have failed to respond to its requests. Hopefully, the constant drumbeat on this topic will only drive additional responsible companies to make progress. General Electric ousted John Flannery after a year as its chairman and C.E.O., by far the shortest leadership tenure in the conglomerate's 126-year history. It shows how tough things have gotten there. Mr. Flannery was supposed to turn G.E.'s fortunes around. But like his predecessor, Jeff Immelt, he'll be handing over a lot of problems: G.E. says it is taking a $23 billion write-down in its power business, and its financial arm and pension fund are messes. Now, for the first time, G.E.'s board is turning to an outsider: Lawrence Culp Jr., formerly C.E.O. of another conglomerate, Danaher, where he struck transformative deals and greatly improved efficiency. G.E. shares rose 7 percent yesterday, suggesting at least some investors are confident that Mr. Culp can deliver another miracle. The company looks to need one. Bonus: Mr. Flannery may not get a golden parachute. The dust has settled on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — the successor to Nafta — so it's time to consider it in detail. Jim Tankersley of the NYT explains how it changes the three countries' trading relationships. President Trump has declared it a victory, bringing ""cash and jobs"" into the U.S. For Canada, it's more of a relief. But for Mr. Trump, the deal with America's second- and third-largest trading partners clears the way for what he sees as the big target: China. More on that from Bob Davis of the WSJ: A renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement, Trump advisers argue, removes the possibility that a trade war could break out on the continent and will make North America a more attractive place for investment. When combined with U.S. tariffs against China, which boost the costs of production there, foreign companies will start moving investment out of China, the administration calculates. That would weaken China's ability to produce next-generation technology and put additional pressure on Beijing to make trade concessions sought by the U.S. Mr. Trump appears happy to play a long game. ""China wants to talk very badly,"" he said at a news conference yesterday. ""I said frankly it's too early to talk, because they're not ready."" Jay Powell discusses employment and inflation. The Fed chairman is speaking at the National Association for Business Economics' 60th annual meeting in Boston, where analysts will listen for hints about economic tightening. Automakers publish their September sales figures. New-vehicle numbers have slowed since a peak in 2016 of 17.6 million for the year, but estimates suggest they were robust in September, and could hit 17 million this year. PepsiCo reports third-quarter results. They'll be the last overseen by the outgoing C.E.O., Indra Nooyi. Investors will pay close attention to the soda business, as Pepsi pushes toward healthier drinks through moves like its $3.2 billion acquisition of SodaStream. Rows of new vehicles made by Elon Musk's electric car company are being detected in unexplained locations across the country — from San Francisco to Salt Lake City, Chicago to Las Vegas. Neal E. Boudette of the NYT has been following a trail of evidence online, which hints at potential issues with production, logistics, quality — and even demand: Mr. Musk had long promised that the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000. But the least costly version available now starts at $49,000, and the price nears $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot driver-assistance software and other options. The company has said that more than 400,000 customers are waiting to buy Model 3 sedans, and that each paid a $1,000 deposit. Many who put down deposits may be waiting for the more affordable base model. More Tesla news: Why a criminal probe into Mr. Musk's tweets now looks unlikely. How the S.E.C. is trying to foist traditional corporate governance on the company. It may build a new tent outside its factory. And why Mr. Musk is probably still good for the future of electric cars. Charles Schwab turned his budget-basement retail brokerage into an investment giant that manages over $3.6 trillion of customer money. But fintech start-ups are after those customers. In an interview with Bloomberg Markets, Mr. Schwab, now the company's chairman, and Walt Bettinger, its C.E.O., explain how they're fighting back: While tech is becoming ever more dominant, Bettinger says the human element is what will help the company ward off the threats posed by online competitors. When it comes to financial services, he says, clients ultimately want to talk to a live person — in a web chat, on the phone, or at a branch office. In 2016, less than a year after introducing its robo-adviser, Charles Schwab began offering fee-based personal consultations for accounts of at least $25,000. Companies such as Ant Financial or Amazon, which analysts have speculated will eventually move into finance, would be challenged to build those kinds of offerings at Charles Schwab's scale, Bettinger says. ""I'd like to think that we're a blend of Amazon and Nordstrom,"" he says. Applicant numbers have been falling for years — but now even top schools like Harvard Business School and Wharton are feeling the pinch, writes Kelsey Gee of the WSJ: Harvard Business School received 9,886 applications for this fall's entering class, down 4.5 percent from last year — the biggest drop since 2005. Applications to Wharton fell 6.7 percent to 6,245. At Stanford's Graduate School of Business, they slid 4.6 percent to 7,797. Such top schools are still receiving many more applications than they can accept, but the declines mark a reversal after years of growth. Reasons for the slump? Rising college debt has made M.B.A.s too expensive for many people, and higher hurdles for work visas have pushed foreign students to international schools instead. For nearly a decade, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Vinod Khosla has waged an unusually high-profile legal battle over a beach access path that cuts through a coastal village he owns near Half Moon Bay, Calif. He wanted it closed. But while he lost the fight, he's apparently happy about it. Nellie Bowles of the NYT explains why: As the case wound its way up to the Supreme Court, it threatened to gut California's Coastal Act of 1976, which enshrines public access to beaches as a right. ""If I were to ever win in the Supreme Court, I'd be depressed about it,"" he told The New York Times this year. ""I support the Coastal Act; I don't want to weaken it by winning. But property rights are even more important."" Ian Read will step down as Pfizer's C.E.O. at year end, but stay on as executive chairman. (His successor, Albert Boula, could consider doing more deals.) Adam Mosseri will become Instagram's chief; its co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger resigned last week. Sridhar Ramaswamy is stepping down as Google's ad chief. He will join the investment firm Greylock Partners. Gita Gopinath will become the I.M.F.'s first female chief economist.

News,2018-10-02,"SEATTLE — Amazon said on Tuesday that it would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour for its United States employees, a rare acknowledgment that it was feeling squeezed by political pressure and a tight labor market. The raises apply for part-time workers and those hired through temporary agencies.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/business/amazon-minimum-wage.html,1462," SEATTLE — Amazon said on Tuesday that it would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour for its United States employees, a rare acknowledgment that it was feeling squeezed by political pressure and a tight labor market. The raises apply for part-time workers and those hired through temporary agencies. The company said it would also lobby Washington to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been set at $7.25 for almost a decade. The new wages will apply to more than 250,000 Amazon employees, including those at the grocery chain Whole Foods, as well as the more than 100,000 seasonal employees it plans to hire for the holiday season. The change will not apply to contract workers. It goes into effect on Nov. 1. ""We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,"" Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said in a statement. ""We're excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us."" Employment has become one of Amazon's most potent political vulnerabilities as well as its most important political message. The shift to online shopping, led by Amazon, has forced many retailers like Toys ""R"" Us and Sears to shut down or lay off workers across the country. President Trump has criticized the company for hurting traditional retailers, and some lawmakers have called for the company to be broken up. At the same time, jobs at Amazon's warehouses and sorting centers have boomed. The company now employs about 575,000 people worldwide, up more than 50 percent in the past year, a fact Amazon frequently plays up. But the pay of those workers has become a growing issue for activists, especially as the fortunes of Amazon and Mr. Bezos have skyrocketed. Amazon's market capitalization passed $1 trillion last month, though it has since fallen slightly below that level. Mr. Bezos is now the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $165 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. ""I think they saw the writing on the wall. I think they saw the calculation that it was indefensible that a man whose wealth is over $150 billion be able to continue paying workers wages that are so low that they are forced to rely on federal benefits,"" Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said in an interview after the announcement. ""Smart people are willing to change course."" Mr. Sanders and labor organizers have criticized the wages and conditions of Amazon's work force. They have focused on employees at the company's warehouses, and with the contract drivers who make last-mile deliveries. Some workers at the grocery chain Whole Foods, which Amazon bought last year, have recently begun a push to organize a union. Amazon had been paying a starting minimum wage of $11 an hour, and said its average wage for full-time workers at the fulfillment centers where it packages and sorts orders was more than $15 an hour. It had not disclosed pay for part-time and contract workers. Amazon said workers who now make more than $15 an hour will also get a pay bump, though it won't say how much. As recently as last month Amazon was resisting the pressure. Mr. Sanders had pointed to new financial disclosures from the company showing its median pay was $28,446, meaning half of its employees made less. Amazon, which is typically reserved when responding to criticism, publicly pushed back, saying Mr. Sanders's statements were ""misleading"" and that median pay for its full-time employees in the United States was $34,123. Mr. Sanders said he was particularly surprised to see Mr. Bezos raising pay to $15 almost immediately, rather than phasing it in over several years. ""That is bold, no question about it,"" he said. Mr. Bezos thanked Mr. Sanders on Twitter for praising the change. ""We're excited about this, and also hope others will join in,"" Mr. Bezos wrote. The union-backed Fight for $15 campaign, which has been calling for a higher minimum wage for six years, called Amazon's plan a major victory. It is organizing strikes in several states this week to build support for unions in advance of the midterm elections. Fight for $15 says more than a fifth of the population in the United States now lives in a state or city that has passed a $15 wage target, including California and New York, two major markets for Amazon. Increasingly, the company is putting operations close to and inside city borders to enable quick delivery. ""Workers worldwide have been standing up, joining together, and winning!"" the organization said in a message on Twitter. ""Amazon is just the latest company to respond."" Amazon has added robots at its warehouses and has expanded experiments like Amazon Go, its cashierless convenience stores that require few employees. But it still has a huge need for workers, particularly as the holiday season approaches. With the United States unemployment rate below 4 percent, the tight labor market has made it harder to attract the workers it and other retailers need. The smaller supply of prospective workers has slowly been pushing wages higher. The average wage for retail sales workers across the United States is $13.20 an hour, according to federal data. For all retail workers, including salespeople, cashiers and supervisors, the average wage is $18.85. Last year Target announced it would raise minimum pay to $15 an hour by 2020, and Costco  raised its to $14 an hour. In January, Walmart, the country's largest private employer, said it was raising starting wages to $11 after the new tax law passed, though critics noted that it was laying off workers as it tried to quietly close 63 Sam's Club stores. ""At the moment in the United States, unemployment is pretty low, and Amazon may be struggling to recruit and retain employees,"" said Alan Manning, an economics professor at the London School of Economics who has studied minimum wage policies. ""It's also a bit of good publicity."" Indeed, less than an hour after the announcement on Tuesday, Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president in charge of operations, posted a video on Twitter of employees at a fulfillment center in Southern California cheering as he broke the news to them. Amazon also announced minimum pay increases to £10.50 in London and £9.50 elsewhere in Britain. It said the minimum pay would benefit 17,000 Amazon employees and more than 20,000 seasonal workers in the country. The wage increase comes as the company plans to announce the location of its second headquarters before the end of this year. The new site, which Amazon says will eventually employ up to 50,000 highly paid technology workers, is widely expected to get what could be billions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives from state and local governments. The size of the potential taxpayer payout, and the secrecy around the bidding process, have frustrated even some lawmakers in cities hoping to land the headquarters. With the company's promise to help lobby for a higher minimum wage, it attached itself to a progressive cause. Almost all of the 20 regions on Amazon's shortlist are run by Democrats, so the increase may buy the company some local good will. It also lets Amazon, which accounts for almost half of all online sales in the United States, ratchet up pressure on other retailers. ""Once you're paying a higher wage, you tend to want your competitors to also pay a higher wage,"" said Professor Manning. ""If your costs are going up, you'd also quite like your rivals' costs to go up as well."" Amazon provided almost no details in its announcement about how it plans to push for a higher federal minimum wage, and a representative at the company declined to elaborate. But the business has, in recent years, built one of the largest lobbying teams in Washington, spending $13 million last year. Given the political divide in the current Congress, Mr. Sanders said it still seemed unlikely that higher wages would pass. Instead, Mr. Sanders said, it's more likely to become a campaign issue, as well as put pressure on other large employers. Mr. Bezos's ""decision today is going to have a ripple effect to other corporations and other cities and states,"" he said. And unions say Amazon is not off the hook either. Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is in the early stages of working with employees at Whole Foods, said in a statement that the wage increase was a ""positive step."" But he said it did not address other conditions, like giving more workers full-time positions and alleviating the production pressure some employees feel. ""There is still so very much more that Amazon needs to do to be considered a decent employer,"" he said."

Known for a time as the Queen of the North, Stockton was the departure point in 1825 for the world's first public passenger railway. It was also the place, in the 1880s, where Michael Marks, a penniless Polish immigrant, got his start as a market peddler, the early stirrings of a business that would eventually become one of the country's best-known brand names, Marks & Spencer. Stockton had one of the first stores in the country. M & S — or Marks and Sparks, as it's affectionately called — is now a cultural fixture in the daily lives of millions of Britons. Most girls are fitted for their first bras at M & S. A third of the country goes to the store to buy knickers, the British word for women's underwear. Its Colin the Caterpillar cakes are omnipresent at birthday parties for kids and adults alike, while the chain's staple candy, the gummy Percy Pig, sells at a rate of 10 pigs per second, or 300 million per year. But on Aug. 11, the Marks & Spencer store here closed. As profit falls and e-commerce reshapes retail, the company will shut 100 stores by 2022 — a corporate restructuring that will play out in communities. ""It's the end of an era, really — it's ever so sad,"" Joe Harland, 84, said as he wheeled his M & S grocery trolley from the store to the car park this summer before it closed. ""The quality of the food is superb, and the staff are so kind and friendly. I'm not sure we will come into town so much anymore without it here."" Marks & Spencer is far from the only British retailer experiencing difficulty. House of Fraser collapsed last month, requiring a last-minute bailout. Debenhams looks likely to follow suit. And profit at John Lewis plummeted 99 percent in the first half of the year. But M & S is under attack from all sides. Competitors sell cheaper, trendier clothes; supermarkets have raised the quality of their food; and online shopping has become the norm. ""If you were building from scratch, you would not combine midprice fashion with premium food and a bit of furniture,"" said Natalie Berg, a consultant at NBK Retail. ""They are stuck with a business model that is not really relevant any more."" The spread of Marks &Spencer's shop-floor offerings — once the beating heart of its appeal — could be its Achilles' heel. In May, the chain announced a 62 percent drop in pretax profit to less than 67 million pounds, or roughly $87 million, dragged down by restructuring costs alongside slumping sales in food and clothing. The retailer's decline has been so precipitous that Marks & Spencer was almost dropped from Britain's Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 index, a stark turnabout for a company that was an original member of the list in 1984. With a stock price around 282 pence, Marks & Spencer is holding on to the last spot, at No. 100. ""This business is on a burning platform,"" Marks & Spencer's chairman, Archie Norman, said at its annual meeting this year. (He and Steve Rowe, the chief executive, declined to comment for this article.) Refusing to rule out further closings and job losses, Mr. Norman added: ""We don't have a God-given right to exist, and unless we change and develop this company the way we want to, in decades to come there will be no M & S."" Founded in 1884, with a slogan that read, ""Don't ask the price, it's a penny,"" the business began to flourish after Mr. Marks formed a partnership with a onetime cashier, Thomas Spencer. Later, under Mr. Marks's son, Simon, and Simon's partner, Israel Sieff, the family business boomed, securing a unique foothold in British society. Sally Morrison, head of marketing for Lightbox Jewelry, has lived in the United States for more than 30 years. But she returns to London about seven or eight times a year — and every time she does, she makes a pilgrimage to Marks & Spencer for its underwear and spicy ketchup. She remembers going to the store with her mother in her hometown, Aldershot, about 30 miles southwest of London, at the age of 8. That store closed last year. ""Going into M & S is part of the ritual of coming home for me because it has been offering me the same staples all my life,"" Ms. Morrison said. ""It occupies a comfortable and comforting space that it has done since I was a little girl."" Allowing aspirational shoppers in class-obsessed Britain to keep up appearances of upward social mobility gave the chain serious commercial and cultural clout. It made previously exotic items like fresh fruit and cashmere sweaters available to the masses. The aisles gave shoppers their first taste of delicacies beyond British borders, from tinned mandarins in the 1930s to avocados in the 1960s and chicken Kiev in the 1970s. ""It brought quality, value and innovation at very competitive prices to Brits of all class backgrounds, earning it unparalleled trust and affection, a very powerful thing,"" said Stuart Rose, chief executive of Marks & Spencer from 2004 to 2010. ""Delivering what the customer expected and never letting them down was what allowed M & S to produce uninterrupted profit increases from 1884 to 1999."" ""Marks & Spencer democratized shopping on a national scale for consumers,"" he added. For decades a family-run company, Marks & Spencer was also a pioneer in corporate responsibility and benefits. Long before the national health care system, the company, in the 1920s and '30s, offered generous medical benefits and free breakfasts for those who started a shift at 7 a.m. Manfred Dessau, 92, who owned a family business in Nottingham that supplied blouses to Marks & Spencer for over 50 years, said the company had long-lasting relationships with many manufacturers. A German-born Jewish escapee from the Holocaust, Mr. Dessau came to Britain with his family after his father found a guarantor who could give him factory work. When his father set up his factory, Marks & Spencer gave him his first order. ""They were wonderful people, and I felt very lucky to work for them. I know many other people who felt the same way,"" Mr. Dessau said. ""They were there from the very beginning of our company's life, and I never forgot that. For a very long time — until the 1990s — they were the best of the best when it came to British-made goods. I still wear top-to-toe M & S every single day."" Despite Britain's sentimental attachment, the chain's all-in-one model, heavily weighted to a motley array of brick-and-mortar stores on High Streets, has not held up well in the era of e-commerce. The company has been slow in adapting to changing shopping habits, although executives have said they expect a third of the M & S clothing and housewares business to move online over the next five years. There is the confusing mix of goods — a premium food business, midprice fashion and a smattering of housewares. With margins being squeezed for all grocers and ever more competition from discounters like Aldi and Lidl, the food business appears stale. Marks & Spencer has had a handful of successful collaborations with British celebrities like Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Alexa Chung. When Gareth Southgate, who coached the English national soccer team to an unexpected berth in the semifinals of the World Cup this summer, showed up on the sideline wearing a buttoned-up waistcoat, social media lit up with the news that it was a Marks & Spencer original. It prompted a run on stores. But few of the retailer's more fashion forward collaborations have created much of a stir with millennials, who opt for the likes of Zara. And middle-age and older shoppers continue to grumble about a sliding quality of fabric and fit in many of the classic items on which M & S made its name. Mr. Rose said he felt that chasing young consumers had hastened the recent downward spiral at M & S. The key to the golden gate, he said, are women, who buy all the ladies' wear, most of the children's wear and half the men's wear, as well as home goods. ""Keep the middle-class housewives happy and give them what they want and M & S will get itself back on track,"" Mr. Rose said. In Stockton, the departure of M & S has dealt a heavy blow to those who depended on its presence in the town center for more than 100 years. ""M & S has been an important part of this community for a long time,"" Mr. Harland, the 84-year-old customer, said. ""We've seen a lot of shops shut over the years, though there has been some investment into the town, too. Still, M & S was never one I thought we would see go."""

An establishing aerial shot of Apple's new circular headquarters set up a ""Mission: Impossible""-inspired video sketch: The keynote speech is about to start, and it's an emergency. A young woman is summoned into action, clutching a metallic briefcase while running, jumping, tripping and sliding her way out of the sparsely inhabited mile-round structure where she works. This rush across Apple's depopulated futurescape is interrupted by an Apple Watch notifying our hero that she had completed her activity goal for the day; she runs into a colleague who uses his to teleport. The real punch line arrives when she delivers her package to Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook — and it's not a new product, but the remote control he needs for his presentation. The subtext, in this now-customary display of self-deprecation, is that Apple, which saw its market capitalization pass $1 trillion in August this year, doesn't quite know what to do with itself. Steve Jobs was fond of pointing out the limits of market research. Customers ""don't know what they want until we've shown them,"" he would say, sometimes invoking a (probably apocryphal) adage from Henry Ford: If he had asked people what they wanted, ""they would have said, 'Faster horses.' "" Whether we understand this sentiment as an actual operating principle or as self-aggrandizing narrative, it does not quite account for what has become of Apple in the post-Jobs era. The company never achieved true dominance until the staggering rise of the iPhone, which was a Jobs-era project, but the iPhone itself didn't succeed until after Apple relinquished its total control over it. At launch, Jobs imagined the device as a phone that could go to websites. There were no third-party apps. Today, however, we associate our smartphones with the apps we use on them. They're for Instagram or Facebook; they're for WhatsApp, or for buying things on Amazon, or for checking your Gmail. They belong, in other words, to the internet giants, some of which are Apple's competitors and together dominate the time we spend with Apple's core product. In a bid to show people what they wanted, Jobs ended up creating perhaps history's most efficient tool for simply asking them, and then letting others supply the answers. The Apple Watch, a new version of which was announced at the event, was initially pitched, in 2014, as a salve for the excesses of your iPhone. Just as Apple had lost control of its iPhone to the invasive, distracting internet companies, those customers had lost control over their own experiences. The Apple Watch — with its smaller screen and emphasis on checking rather than interacting — was pitched with marketing that evoked adventure, activity and, above all, escape, as much from work or home as from the iPhone itself. Four years and millions of sales later, the Apple-Watch-as-iPhone-antidote pitch remains, as do its use cases as fitness and health devices. More important is what hasn't yet happened. Whether by accident or by design, the watch has so far been immune to the runaway success that redefined the iPhone. Apple is still in the process — and still in charge — of guessing what most people could get out of an Apple Watch. It's a device that is neither a simple reflection of pre-emptive market research nor a product reshaped by its own popularity. What future it may have still belongs to Apple. And this appears to be making the company anxious. In its announcement, and in mass-marketing materials, the new Apple Watch displays its broader, busier face, resplendent with data: the time and date, the weather, the UV index. There are indicators in various states of progress, recording a life of constant action: timers counting down; steps counting toward a goal; a song nearing completion. Up top, a reminder: 11:15 A.M. TRAINING WITH KRISTA. These carefully chosen marketing images represent a plausible day in the life of no one so much as the very Apple executives presenting the product onstage, many appearing to be in some advanced stage of the reverse-aging epidemic that has afflicted Silicon Valley in recent years. During the presentation, executives shared glimpses of a lifestyle that was very obviously, as the product inscriptions say, ""Designed by Apple in California"" — attractive human bodies propelling themselves up and down mountains, surfacing between waves or wending through their local picturesque countryside. It's the sort of destination recreation you might only daydream about at the office until you're snapped out of it by your regular Apple Watch reminder to stand up — that is, unless you live in the Bay Area and work at a place like Apple. New iPhone announcements may have been reduced to faster-horse affairs, but at least Apple doesn't have to guess who, or what, smartphones are for. Over the years, iPhones have become more aware of the world around them, laden with new sensors and microphones and cameras. The Apple Watch is becoming, with each generation, better at sensing what's going on with, and inside, its wearers' bodies. Apple boasts that its latest model introduces a functioning electrocardiogram, or EKG, widening the scope of the device's body monitoring well beyond elective physical activities or passive quantification and into active diagnosis. (The function won't be available until later this year.) The Apple Watch can warn when a wearer's heart rate has dipped too low, or jumped too high; the Series 4 can ask, when it senses an abrupt movement, if you might have fallen, offering to call an ambulance. For now, this impressive facility for collecting and organizing information about you is just that — it's a great deal of data with not many places to go. This is sensitive information, of course, and Apple's relative commitment to privacy — at least compared with advertising-centric companies like Google and Facebook — might be enough to get new users strapped in and recording. As Apple continues its institutional struggle to conceive of what the Apple Watch is, or could be, in the imaginations of its customers, it's worth remembering that Apple's stated commitment to privacy is, in practice, narrow. The competitors that Cook likes to prod about their data-exploitative business models have a necessary and complicit partner in his company, having found many of their customers though Apple's devices and software. This is especially relevant as Apple casts about for ideas elsewhere. Apple has already met with the insurance giant Aetna about ways in which the company might use Apple Watches to encourage healthier — and cheaper — behavior in its tens of millions of customers. John Hancock, one of the largest life insurers in America, said after Apple's latest announcement that it would offer all its customers the option of an interactive policy, in which customers would get discounts for healthy habits, as evidenced by data from wearable devices. Here we see the vague outlines of how the Apple Watch could become vital, or at least ubiquitous, as the handmaiden to another data-hungry industry. There may be many other ways, still, that the Apple Watch can fulfill its presumed destiny as the next device that we suddenly can't remember a world without. It would be out of character for Apple to admit that the iPhone, its biggest success, was in reality a triumph of mass-market research, and to announce its intentions to do it all again, letting others figure out the real value of its device — or, more specifically, the value of the user data it could provide. Apple is left still guessing, with more persistence than confidence, what customers might not yet know they want. Meanwhile, the market is watching, and coming up with its own answers."
News,2018-10-03,"“Hey! Lucas, right?” I heard a voice as I walked around the Gifford Park Neighborhood Market, a compact but lively farmers’ market that was a quick walk from the room I was renting on Cass Street in Omaha. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/travel/frugal-omaha.html,1864," ""Hey! Lucas, right?"" I heard a voice as I walked around the Gifford Park Neighborhood Market, a compact but lively farmers' market that was a quick walk from the room I was renting on Cass Street in Omaha.  The voice belonged to Alex O'Hanlon, whom I'd met just a couple of days earlier at a donation-based fermentation workshop she had led at City Sprouts, a local organization with a large community garden that promotes health and seeks to improve food quality in the community. Alex and I chatted, and I shared some tamales I'd bought from a market vendor. Remembering my name and saying hello was maybe a small gesture for Alex, but as an out-of-towner, I was impressed. But I wasn't really surprised that the locals were friendly in Omaha, the biggest city in Nebraska, located about halfway between Sioux Falls, S.D., and Kansas City, Mo. What surprised me during a recent four-day trip was how big the city seemed. I'm not talking about surface area: Omaha, in addition to its famous zoo, has a progressive sensibility that places its good restaurants, live-music scene and diverse entertainment options on par with cities many times its size. And it's worth a visit for any curious traveler who, like me, is keen on saving money. My Airbnb host, Orenda, was accommodating when a flight cancellation led me to arrive a day later than expected (my private room with bath was $41 a night). She and her partner, both musicians, gave me some recommendations for activities in the area, and let me use their driveway for the car I'd rented through Turo. This was the first time I had used Turo, a service that operates something like Airbnb and lets private citizens list and rent out their own cars online. The high rates from the national agencies made me get past my trepidation of renting from a total stranger, and I picked a Hyundai Accent from a woman named Stephanie for $33 a day. Luckily, Stephanie was an old hand and she made the pickup and drop-off of the car seamless. One difference with Turo is that there are frequently limits on the number of miles you can drive your rental (300 in my case) — be careful not to exceed your maximum, or you'll pay an extra fee. I also made good use of the public bus system, which I found to be a reliable way of making short trips. I bought a book of 10 rides ($12.50) at a local supermarket, and set out to see the city. My first stop was at Artifact, a store that specializes in handmade aprons and tote bags. The Omaha-based brand, which got its start on Etsy, makes its products locally. I was even encouraged to peek into a large area behind the showroom to watch some items being sewn and assembled. They're not exactly for shoppers on a budget, however: Some run well over $100, so I picked up a locally made bar of eucalyptus and rosemary soap from Benson Soap Mill ($6). The nearby Joslyn Art Museum, just south of Creighton University, was a logical next stop: The only thing better than a world-class art collection is a free world-class art collection. The Joslyn's collection includes exceptional examples of work from the ancient world, Renaissance and Baroque masterpieces, modern and contemporary art, and pieces inspired by the American West. The museum also made very effective use of multimedia in one of the first exhibits I saw. Using a small touch-screen, visitors can watch an examination of a Madonna-and-Child triptych, painted by an unknown artist, that carefully explores the work, section by section, explaining its style, composition and symbolism. It explains how the museum came to deduce that the painting was likely done in the early 16th century by a follower of the Flemish artist Jan Gossaert. All in all, a fascinating and educational whodunit for a painting I might otherwise have overlooked. Head upstairs for the American Indian art collection, with artifacts like ration ticket bags and medicine pouches from the Ute and Sioux tribes, as well as work like the pictograph-based ""Horse Sense (for advice and council)"" by the New Mexican artist Jaune Quick-To-See Smith. El Museo Latino ($5 admission) features Hispanic and Latino art and history and also serves as a cultural center. A larger-than-life textile exhibit from the Mexican artist Marcela Diaz was particularly enjoyable, and included a comically large hammock woven from coconut fibers. Some exceptionally beautiful prints were also on display, like Gabriel Macotela's ""Ruinas de la Independencia"" and Manolo Roldán's ""Fragile."" I won't spend too much time singing the praises of the Omaha Zoo, which has been one of Omaha's major tourist draws for decades, but I can't leave it out because it is too good to miss, especially if you have children. The minute you enter the gate ($21.95 for adults, $15.95 for children) and see the awe-inspiring geodesic Desert Dome, you know you're in for a treat. Don't miss the primates, particularly the Western Lowland gorillas and Diana monkeys, as well as the lemur enclosure: Red-Ruffed lemurs are running free, sidling up close enough to touch (but don't). To experience nature in a slightly different way, head farther south to the Fontenelle Forest Nature Center, on the Nebraska-Iowa border. The serene forest ($11 admission), along the Missouri River, has miles of trails of varying degrees of difficulty for those looking for a healthy hike. Don't miss the Raptor Woodland Refuge, where the center rehabilitates injured birds of prey. On my visit, Rusty, a red-tailed hawk suffering from a gunshot wound, and Minerva, a great horned owl that suffered two broken wings after a car hit her, both seemed to be recovering admirably. Omaha's Old Market area, a charming concentration of repurposed buildings over a century old, is worth a quick visit. Once the home wholesale and retail grocers in the city, there are now art galleries, shops and restaurants lining the brick streets. I parked my car in a $1-an-hour lot and stopped for an iced tea at Urban Abbey, which might best be described as a coffeehouse of worship, as it combines both a church and a coffeehouse. There are modern church services in the shop's warm, open space (""The World According to Mister Rogers"" is the name of one sermon series) and part of my purchase ($2.50 for a mango peach iced tea) went to benefit Nebraska Appleseed, an organization that supports immigrant rights. I wondered if activism with a decidedly progressive bent struggled to thrive in a state as red as Nebraska, and I asked Eithne Leahy, an Omaha native who was working behind the counter. ""It sort of works,"" she said. ""There's lots of great work being done on a grass-roots level with nonprofits and churches. But with the government …"" She paused. ""Not so much."" There's as much to do in Omaha at night as there is during the day. A hip-hop variety night at the Reverb Lounge, hosted by D.J. Houston Alexander, was a great place to kick back with an Old Style beer ($3.50) and enjoy music by local artists. Brothers Lounge, with carpeting and a fireplace, had a pleasingly dingy atmosphere that went well with the $1 bag of Gardetto's and $4 Pyramid apricot ale I purchased. I snacked and listened to a couple of bands ($5 cover) that were playing that evening: The dreamy, synth-heavy Rogue Moon, and Media Jeweler, a four-piece outfit that I can best describe as Weezer meets Frank Zappa. While I only caught the tail end of their show, I thoroughly enjoyed Dent May, a Los Angeles-based band playing at the Slowdown ($12). Their song ""Born Too Late"" was both pop-y and wistful; I liked it so much, I bought a band T-shirt. But little could compare to Hard Candy Omaha ($20), a drag show hosted by the Max, a gay club on Jackson Street downtown. In a sauna-like room jam-packed with people, the evening's M.C. introduced a series of impeccably dressed performers who lip-synced, vogued and cartwheeled down a short runway to different popular songs (and the dollar bills of appreciative audience members). Finally, the M.C. gave the crowd what it had eagerly been awaiting. ""Are you ready for something thin, white and salty?"" he asked. The crowd roared with enthusiasm as the evening's headliner, Miz Cracker, a popular drag performer who was on the reality series RuPaul's Drag Race, came onstage to ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" and blew the roof off. Nourishment is needed after any good night out, and Omaha proved more than up to the challenge. Steak is synonymous with the city, but good steak isn't cheap. Fortunately, there are a number of good steakhouses with reasonably priced lunchtime options. The Drover is one, a dimly-lit, cavernous restaurant with a very tasty seven-ounce, whisky-marinated sirloin ($15.95). Johnny's Cafe, opened in 1922, greets diners with a vaguely intimidating, elaborately wrought set of metal front doors. Two long, pointed steer horns that act as handles foreshadow the meal to come. Johnny's is a relic from a bygone era: red leather booths, martinis and plenty of taxidermy adorning the walls. The lunch special, a $9.96 prime rib sandwich (so-priced for the 96th anniversary of the restaurant) with fries and coleslaw, is tough to beat. Check out Farine and Four if you're after coffee — the bright, spacious cafe with an open kitchen also served a mean $8 herring toast when I visited. Nearby Spielbound is a good option, too. A board game cafe with more than 2,000 games ($5 for a day pass), it also serves coffee, beer and food. I stopped in for a good $3.75 hibiscus iced tea. On the slightly more upscale side of the dining spectrum, Yoshitomo in the Benson neighborhood made for a great sushi stop one afternoon during their weekday happy hour (4 to 6 p.m.). The yaki gindara, torched sablefish with yuzu miso ($7.50), was particularly good. And then there's the Alpine Inn. It's tough to explain my immediate love for this magnificent, slightly off-kilter establishment. Is it the outstanding fried chicken, hot and juicy on the inside with skin that shatters like the shell on a crème brûlée? Or is it the outdoor platform where raccoons and cats gnaw on the discarded chicken bones and potato wedges? It might be Justine, who fretted over my ID for about five minutes, initially refusing to serve me the Coors Light I ordered. ""Nope, nope,"" she said, shaking her head. ""You've got a baby face, this can't be you."" The other week, she said, an underage woman working with a police sting operation came in trying to get served. ""You promise you're over 21?"" she asked. ""I promise,"" I said, and she handed me my beer. ""You're under arrest!"" I said. Justine's face fell for a second, then she burst into laughter when she saw that I was joking. ""I swear I was about to jump over the bar and beat the hell out of you!"" While I waited for my chicken, we made small talk, chatting about our families, the history of the inn — everything and nothing. I felt perfectly comfortable and at home; It was a feeling I'd become well acquainted with during my stay in Omaha."

Down on the ground, Bayonne, which has about six square miles and 67,000 people, has more conventional proportions.  Yet there is still a pleasant sense of proximity, residents say. Short blocks, shopkeepers who know their customers, and families that stick around for generations foster intimacy.  ""It's really the best of both worlds,"" said Arthur Saks, 30, who moved to Bayonne in 2010 from the Great Kills neighborhood on Staten Island. ""It's close enough to New York to have a city feel, but you get that small-town vibe at the same time."" 1 mile NEW JERSEY Jersey City stephen R. GREGG park HUDSON-BERGEN Light rail BROADWAY Newark Bay 45th St. station 34th St. station Farmers' Market 22nd St. station Bayonne New York Bay 8th St. station Bergen Point Kill Van Kull N.Y. PA. Dennis P. Collins park NEW JERSEY BAYONNE BR. New York City STATEN ISLAND Bayonne N.Y.   By The New York Times Mr. Saks, a chef and restaurant consultant, initially came to help a city with ""a pizzeria on every corner"" expand its dining options: A pizzeria hired him to add a white-tablecloth option. With a career that has taken him to Alaska and other far-flung places, Mr. Saks was wary of putting down deep roots, so he rented a two-bedroom apartment with his girlfriend. But over time, Bayonne, where Mr. Saks has relatives, began to charm him. After marrying that girlfriend, now Annemarie Saks, 30, he bought a two-family house with her in 2015, for $410,000. Today, the couple and their infant daughter occupy a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with a home office in that house; a two-bedroom, one-bathroom rental is downstairs. Last spring, Mr. Saks cut the ribbon on Saks Off Broadway, a sandwich shop he owns, which, in a nod to Bayonne's ubiquitous dish, serves a ""pizza-wich,"" a folded-slice creation. ""I have become a huge advocate for what Bayonne can be,"" he said. The future appears to be arriving quickly. Since the last recession, or about 2010, more than 6,000 new apartments — many with snazzy finishes and New York City-style amenities — have opened, are under construction or are in the works, according to planning officials. Most have come to life since 2014, when the current mayor, James Davis, took office. Proudly pro-development, Mr. Davis has awarded property-tax breaks to builders, despite criticism. ""Abatements work,"" he said, citing next-door Jersey City as an example. After its factories closed, Jersey City reinvented itself as a bedroom community of New York City, a transition that some in once-booming Bayonne would like to replicate. As apartments rise in Bayonne, new businesses are appearing on Broadway, a three-and-a-half-mile commercial strip lined with vintage bakeries, cigar shops and newsstands that often appear unchanged from the 1950s. Infrastructure is also improving. Last year, Stephen R. Gregg Park completed a nearly $4 million restoration that added fields and paths. And a first-of-its-kind ferry to Manhattan will set sail from the east side in January, according to a plan by city officials. Though Bayonne, once home to a massive Standard Oil refinery, will likely continue to evolve, residents said, its current low-key life is not a problem. ""Bayonne isn't really a place for hitting the town,"" said Nicole Perry, 49, who sold a two-bedroom in an older co-op in Rego Park, Queens, two years ago to rent a larger two-bedroom in a full-service Bayonne building where similar units start at $2,350 a month. When Friday night rolls around, Ms. Perry, an assistant principal in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, makes a beeline for Jersey City's hopping Grove Street area. But she would never live in a place that lively, she said: ""There's a need to escape from the busyness of life."" The peninsula of Bayonne was probably not named for the French city, said Carmela Ascolese Karnoutsos, Ph.D., a local historian. More likely, it was a derivative of Bayonia, an 1859 development plan that would have added large homes on wide lots to a parcel stretching between two major bodies of water: Newark Bay and New York Bay. The Civil War scuttled those designs, and Bayonne is more densely settled today. Across a grid of numbered and lettered streets, skinny two-family houses, many dressed in siding, stand shoulder to shoulder. Cars park on paved front yards. But high-rises are rare in this low-slung city (at least so far), which allows for some breathing room. And many streets, particularly on the west side, are dead-ends, creating hushed, private enclaves. Rows of houses from the 1920s often feature carbon-copy styles. But on a recent morning, brick ranches on West First Street in the Bergen Point section distinguished themselves with American flags, flower flags and early Halloween décor. Larger single-family homes turn up here and there, as on Wesley Court, which is dotted with colonial and Italianate houses. And West 24th Street houses Sunset Bay, one of the few mobile-home communities left in the region. Among the first major new developments to arrive, in 2009, was the complex now known as Harbor Pointe, a four-story, 544-unit rental offering from Castle Lanterra Properties that has an outdoor pool, a cappuccino machine and games like Skee-Ball. It was built on the former Military Ocean Terminal, a longtime supply center for troops that closed in 1999. The windswept property has been converted slowly. But three new residential complexes, with about 1,000 apartments, have broken ground there, city officials said. Buildings are also sprouting elsewhere, often along the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail line. Examples include a 138-unit development on the site of a former parking lot at 19 East 19th Street, near the 22nd Street rail station, from the Ingerman company. The units, which include walk-in closets, are now leasing. The project might be timely. Bayonne's population reached 67,178 in 2017, according to census figures, up from 61,842 in 2000 (though still short of the 90,000 the city counted during its industrial heyday around World War II). On Sept. 24, 164 properties were for sale in Bayonne, according to Zillow. The priciest was a five-family building listed for $1.25 million; the least expensive was a two-bedroom mobile home listed for $50,000. Property values, often driven by investors, are climbing. In 2016, the average price for a home — including one- and two-family homes, and condos — was $266,000, said Joseph W. Hottendorf, the executive director of the Liberty Board of Realtors, citing data from the Hudson County Multiple Listing Service.  In 2017, the average jumped to $296,000, Mr. Hottendorf said, and in 2018, it is expected to reach $325,000. But that would still be below the 2006 pre-recession peak of $383,000, he said. Rentals are also robust, said Steven Betancurth, an agent with Keller Williams City Life Jersey City Realty. In August, 26 two-bedrooms leased, at an average of $1,700 a month — about what it costs to procure a unit in an older building. Diversifying the red-sauce scene on Broadway are restaurants like House of Flavor, a vegan cafe that opened in 2017. Also arriving that year were the side-by-side Bake N' Brew Cafe and Little Boho Bookshop. The Bridge Art Gallery opened in 2016 in a former funeral parlor. The gallery is owned by Cheryl Mack, 49, and Christopher Mack, 50, transplants from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, who rent a three-bedroom duplex nearby.  ""So many people say, 'I only know Bayonne because of the bridge,'"" Ms. Mack said. ""We want people to know we're more than just a bridge."" On Tuesdays, the city hosts a farmers market at Avenue C and West 26th Street. A big-box experience can be had at two large shopping centers on Route 440; between them, they offer a Walmart, a Lowe's, a multi-screen cinema and a LongHorn Steakhouse. A Costco is taking shape nearby, city officials said, as is a Starbucks, Bayonne's first. Bayonne has 11 elementary schools, which serve students through eighth grade. The smallest is Philip G. Vroom Community School, which enrolled 421 students last year; the largest is Midtown Community School, with 1,087 students. Nicholas Oresko Community School, which has 444 students, offers a gifted program in fifth through eighth grades. Bayonne High School, the city's only public high school, has about 2,600 students. On SAT exams in the 2016-17 school year, students averaged 519 on math and 526 on reading and writing, compared to statewide averages of 552 and 551. All Bayonne students must wear uniforms, which in high school means white, black, gray or maroon shirts. Manhattan-bound commuters can take the light-rail line, which stops at 45th, 34th, 22nd and Eighth Streets, to Jersey City, where they can catch a PATH train. Light-rail trains leave about every 15 minutes; a monthly pass is $70. Those headed to Lower Manhattan grab PATH trains at Exchange Place; for the Midtown crowd, it's the Newport station. A monthly PATH pass is $89, and the total trip can take more than an hour. Some apartment complexes offer private shuttles to the trains. Famous industrial families have a connection to Bayonne beyond its factories. In 1799, after emigrating from France, the du Ponts settled in Bergen Point, in a house they called Bon Sejour, according to the Hagley Museum and Library in Delaware. Bon Sejour would later house employees of LaTourette House, a Victorian-era hotel favored by VIPs like Cornelius Vanderbilt. In the mid-20th century, the area, on the Kill Van Kull, was home to an amusement park, Uncle Milty's Playland. Today, there is Dennis P. Collins Park, which offers views of enormous ships rumbling toward the Bayonne Bridge. For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here. Follow us on Twitter: @nytrealestate."

Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: President Trump has long sold himself as a self-made billionaire, repeatedly saying, ""I built what I built myself."" But in reviewing over 100,000 pages of records, an investigation by The New York Times found that Mr. Trump's finances were deeply intertwined with, and dependent on, his father's wealth. By age 3, Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year from his father's empire. He was a millionaire by age 8. In all, Mr. Trump received at least $413 million in today's dollars from his father's real estate empire. What's more, a large portion of that money came to Mr. Trump through the use of dubious tax schemes in the 1990s, including outright fraud. A lawyer for Mr. Trump said, ""The facts upon which The Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate."" • The inheritance: How Fred Trump made his children rich. • Takeaways: Here are 11 key points from the Times investigation. The F.B.I.'s investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh  could conclude as early as today, with a vote on his Supreme Court nomination possible this week. The bureau finished interviewing Mark Judge, who is said to be the only witness to the alleged sexual assault of Christine Blasey Ford, as well as Deborah Ramirez, who accused Judge Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her while they were students at Yale. But lawyers for Dr. Blasey and for Ms. Ramirez complained that investigators were not pursuing important leads. At a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday, President Trump mocked and imitated Dr. Blasey's Senate testimony last week. The crowd laughed and cheered. • ""We're loud, obnoxious drunks"": A letter written by Judge Kavanaugh in 1983 sheds light on his high school clique. • A new look at ""Wasted"": Our book critic revisits Mr. Judge's 1997 memoir: ""It is not even close to being a good book."" Days after an earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, hopes for rescuing survivors have dwindled. More than 1,200 people were killed and thousands of homes destroyed, but officials say many more days of hardship remain before the true toll is known. The authorities are beginning to assess what went wrong with the early warning system, which failed to predict the size and scale of the tsunami. • How to help: Here's advice on making donations. In Moria, a refugee camp on the island of Lesbos, squalid conditions and an inscrutable asylum process have caused what aid workers describe as a mental health crisis. Trauma, psychosis and suicide attempts are commonplace. Overcrowding is extreme, with 9,000 people living in a space made for 3,100. Sexual assaults and knife attacks happen often. ""Now I feel it would have been better to drown while crossing the sea,"" said an Afghan farmer who arrived in June. The 2018 prize was awarded today to two American scientists and one from Britain. • Why they won: Frances Arnold of the U.S. received half the prize ""for the directed evolution of enzymes,"" while her compatriot George Smith and Gregory Winter of Britain shared the other half for their work on peptides and antibodies. • Amazon said that it would  pay all its U.S. workers at least $15 an hour, including part-time employees and those hired through temporary agencies. It also said it would lobby the federal government for a higher minimum wage. • When the Tesla board rejected a settlement with the S.E.C. last Thursday, it was because Elon Musk had threatened to resign. Two days later, the company and Mr. Musk caved — and got a less generous deal. • Retaliatory tariffs placed on the U.S. by its four biggest trading partners show a similar pattern: They tend to target places where voters backed President Trump in 2016. • Every two years, voters must try to make sense of competing claims about Social Security.

The 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was announced today. In 1911, the honor went to Marie Curie, for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. She was the first woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize. It was her second Nobel: In 1903 she shared the physics prize with her husband and another French scientist for their work on radioactivity. Marie Curie came from humble beginnings. Born Maria Sklodowska in Poland in 1867, she was the youngest of five children. She once summed up her biography in just 21 words: ""I was born in Poland. I married Pierre Curie, and I have two daughters. I have done my work in France."" Marie Curie died in 1934 as a result of exposure to radioactivity, some of it incurred while preparing radium for medical use. She has been the topic of many books and movies. A recent BBC poll deemed her the most influential woman in history. ""Few persons contributed more to the general welfare of mankind and to the advancement of science than the modest, self-effacing woman whom the world knew as Mme. Curie,"" The New York Times wrote after her death. ""Honors were heaped upon her,"" our obituary stated, ""but she was indifferent to most.""

Sign up here. The president claims that his company was built solely through hard work. A 14,000-word investigation by the NYT begs to differ. It found that the Trump Organization owes its success to multimillion-dollar gifts from Fred C. Trump, President Trump's father, and tax schemes that some experts say may have broken the law. Highlights from the investigation: • His father's housing empire started paying Mr. Trump during childhood — the equivalent of $200,000 a year in today's money when he was three. • Mr. Trump has often said that his father lent him only $1 million. He received at least $60.7 million in loans, many never repaid. • Fred Trump grossly undervalued properties that he passed onto his children, dodging hundreds of millions in gift taxes. • The Trumps created a company that inflated the value of equipment purchased for their housing units and passed the difference onto the Trump children. One tax expert said that might have constituted criminal tax fraud. The statute of limitations has passed for potential criminal charges, but the Trump family could face civil fines. New York State's tax regulator said it has opened an investigation. A lawyer for Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the NYT. In raising its minimum wage for all U.S. employees to $15 an hour, Amazon was responding to criticism over its labor practices. But the move also helps it compete in a tight labor market — and potentially wounds its rivals. Amazon has taken fire from all political corners, including President Trump and Senator Elizabeth Warren, over issues from worker conditions to anti-competitive practices. This policy, which affects 250,000 employees and 100,000 seasonal workers, buys it some political good will: Senator Bernie Sanders praised it as a ""shot heard round the world."" Amazon also knew it had to do something to keep delivery drivers and warehouse staff as unemployment has fallen. Target and Walmart already raised hourly wages, though not so far or so fast. Amazon's profit margins will undoubtedly take a hit. But the WSJ editorial board argues that, in lobbying for a higher federal minimum wage, the company is making life more expensive for rivals. Despite no shortage of scandal, Elon Musk's automaker looks to be successfully ramping up car production. It made 80,142 cars in the third quarter, it reported yesterday, 50 percent more than in the second. Its Model 3 output nearly doubled, into the 50,000-to-55,000 range that Mr. Musk had predicted. The carmaker delivered 83,500 vehicles to customers, 55,840 of which were Model 3s, about three times as many as in the second quarter. That's big: The mass-market Model 3 is crucial for Tesla's future. But as Neal Boudette of the NYT writes, the company still faces many challenges, not least on profitability: In previous quarters, the company's costs increased as it made more cars, wiping out any chance at getting into the black. Tesla is expected to report its third-quarter earnings later this month. David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, said that Tesla could report a profit for the quarter but that he was not convinced that it would. ""They're making more cars,"" he said, ""but it's hard to say if they are making money on every one."" Still, it's doing much better than the rest of the American auto market, which had a bad September, with worse to come. Bonus: Mr. Musk reportedly gave Tesla's board an ultimatum: Fight the S.E.C., or I quit. The F.B.I. is expected to finish a new check of Brett Kavanaugh as soon as today. Lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, said that the inquiry (which may be available only to senators) wasn't thorough enough. President Trump yesterday mocked Dr. Ford. Aston Martin begins trading on the London Stock Exchange. The British luxury automaker priced its I.P.O. at 19 pounds per share, but its stock fell by as much as 6.6 percent in early trading. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain will defend her Brexit plan. Her speech at the Conservative Party's conference will reportedly attempt to rally ministers — and the public — around her view of a post-E.U. future ""full of promise."" Facebook Connect, which lets users log into other apps with their Facebook accounts, was supposed to be a digital passport to the rest of the internet. Now it could be a big headache. The company on Friday said that account entry keys for at least 50 million Facebook users had been stolen. But Mike Isaac and Kate Conger of the NYT explain how Facebook Connect could exacerbate the problem: Those stolen credentials could have been used to gain access to so many other sites. Companies that allow customers to log in with Facebook Connect are scrambling to figure out whether their own user accounts have been compromised. The hack and its fallout underscore the lengths to which Facebook has cemented itself as the identity of the internet, and what happens when the security systems of one company — trusted by so many — fail. Facebook says there is currently ""no evidence"" that the hackers have gone into outside apps. But either way, you should probably stop using Facebook Connect. Bonus: The social network is taking new steps to stamp out bullying and harassment. The American economy is enjoying an unusual but sustainable period of low unemployment and low inflation, according to the Fed chairman — and it could continue. Economists usually have interpreted low unemployment as a warning of higher inflation. Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT explains why Mr. Powell is willing to believe that things are different right now: He said the Fed's success in holding down inflation in recent decades has reinforced public expectations that inflation would stay low, and that, in turn, is helping to keep inflation low. ""These developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation,"" Mr. Powell said on Tuesday in Boston at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics. Bonus: What central banks around the world will do next with interest rates. Coinbase, the world's biggest marketplace for trading cryptocurrencies, is close to finalizing a fund-raising round at an $8 billion valuation, Recode reports. Leading the round is Tiger Global Management, a respected venture capital firm that hasn't previously shown interest in the sector. It may mean that major investors believe in crypto, despite the industry's challenges. (Bitcoin is trading at about $6,478, 67 percent below its December 2017 peak, and other digital currencies are trading at lows as well.) Coinbase has suffered from that plunge, according to Recode. But its executives argue that the company remains a technology platform that can ride out the waxing and waning of crypto prices. Unless this all turns out to be a bubble. J.C.

Review,2018-10-03,"So there we were, sitting in a purpose-built plexi-walled tube, gazing out on two black reflecting pools from which silver and gold beams shot dramatically toward the night sky.

Around us, the historic walls of the Palais du Louvre glowed ghostly in the neon light. Then — boom! The spring collections ended, and Space Force arrived. Not the Trump/Pence kind, the Louis Vuitton-by-Nicolas-Ghesquière kind, dressed up in little silk dresses with maxi shoulder impact, printed with splotches of robots and classical statuary like rips in the space-time continuum. Through which later emerged … sleeves. Enormous billowing sleeves orbited by their own rings of Saturn, sleeves like padded astronaut gauntlets, sleeves bristling tiny shards at the shoulders. Among all the sleeves were ground control jackets and aviator trousers in pale pastels (some almost perfectly androgynous), sparkling mesh overlays, graphic rubberized cocoon coats and metallic floral brocade. Also some egg-like helmet/caps. They had a ticket to ride. Louis Vuitton is, as the brand founded on trunks endlessly reminds us, about travel. Fashion is, as all of us sitting in the spring 2019 shows during autumn 2018 know, about the future. Put it together and you get: laser-focused women on an intergalactic tour to the halls of power!  47 Photos View Slide Show › If they also occasionally looked like clubbing extras from a 1980s sci-fi adventure flick, that's O.K. Fact is, it's about time we started aiming higher, instead of embracing the lowest common denominator. There's enough of that going on without fashion adding to the mix. Eyes to the stars (which does not mean Cate Blanchett and others in the Vuitton front row). Ultimately, perhaps that was the most lasting story of the shows: Not the continued embrace of the 1980s and '90s (yawn), or yet another return of boho deluxe in patchwork and fringe (easy), or the growing fascination with gender (sometimes thought-provoking, sometimes trite), but rather the re-emergence of design as a core value; the clawing back up the slippery slope of casual. The belief that a well-dressed body can facilitate a well-dressed mind, and that is something to which we should all aspire at this moment. As Miuccia Prada said after her Miu Miu show: ""It's about what people are discussing now: elegance, glamour, tailoring. Not sport."" That might be taking it a bit far. People are discussing lots of things besides elegance and tailoring but, on one level, she was also right: There was barely a hoodie in sight. The sneakers that had shown up as shameless market bids on so many runways in New York had disappeared by the time we got to Paris. It may seem like a small thing, but it was striking. Certainly they weren't present at Miu Miu. Instead, on a set filled with giant puffy letters that spelled out the brand name but were stacked around willy-nilly like marshmallow mountains, Ms. Prada gave us silk faille slips wrapped around the body and secured with big rosettes at the shoulder or hip, left half undone to expose bra straps at the back and the waistbands of tights. Rough-cut denim bias dresses and sequined shells paired with transparent skirts to show the big pants and knee socks underneath. Cardigans cropped at the ribs and full gray skirts. Tailored leather.  52 Photos View Slide Show › The collection questioned seduction, in an intriguing way (designers are still so skittish around sex it's always kind of a surprise). It was definitely not athleisure, and that was intriguing, too. ""By the nature of fashion the future is the present, and you always have to project your present into a future you hope will be the present when the time comes,"" Mr. Ghesquière said after the Vuitton show, which sounds like some sort of convoluted ""Interstellar"" hooey until you think about it. Essentially, he acknowledged fashion is all a wing and a prayer; designers are crossing their fingers and betting they get the mood right six months down the line. And what they are guessing, in this case, is that we are about to get a little more demanding: of our clothes as of our selves and the world around us. Maybe that really is a moonshot. But, you know, it looked pretty good."

You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/opinion/amazon-minimum-wage-bernie-sanders.html,947," This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. There are two ways to fight the long stagnation in living standards for most Americans. The first is probably the more obvious and the one I spend more time writing about: through government policy. The government can raise the minimum wage. It can increase the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is effectively a wage subsidy. It can cut taxes on the middle class. It can spend more money on education, child care and health care. All of these are good ideas. But they're not the only way to lift living standards. For much of the past century, another approach has been even more important: As the economy grew, American companies paid workers their fair share of the growth. Until the mid-1970s or so, this was the norm. The middle class and poor received larger raises than the affluent, in percentage terms, during the three decades after World War II (as you can see in this chart). Labor unions played a central role, using their power to win raises for unionized and non-unionized members alike. And political pressure and cultural norms also mattered. Corporate executives didn't feel comfortable maximizing their own pay and their company's profits at the expense of workers. How can the country return to a time when companies feel the need to pay a decent wage to their workers? Empowering labor unions would make a big difference, but unions aren't likely to return to their previous strength. So it's also important to look for other ways to put political pressure on corporate America. Which brings me to the story about Senator Bernie Sanders and Amazon. For months, Sanders has been criticizing the company for paying its workers too little. He went so far as to offer a bill called the ""Stop BEZOS Act,"" for Jeff Bezos, Amazon's C.E.O. The bill was deeply flawed, but it still served to call more attention to the issue. Eventually, the criticism of the company started spreading to the political right, as Jordan Weissmann of Slate points out. All of this attention wasn't pleasant for Amazon. It cares about its image. It's in the middle of a high-profile process to open a second headquarters in a major city. Many of its executives, no doubt, genuinely want both to earn a profit and to improve people's lives — just as the executives in the mid-20th century did. Yesterday, as you probably heard, Amazon announced that it was raising its minimum hourly pay to $15. About 350,000 workers will receive an immediate raise as a result. Amazon also called on other companies to do the same and said it would lobby Washington to increase the federal minimum wage. A tightening labor market no doubt contributed to Amazon's decision, but politics — avoiding ""the chance of regulations that pose a bigger cost down the road,"" as The Wall Street Journal's Dan Gallagher wrote — was the main factor. This is how democracy and capitalism are supposed to work. ""Jeff Bezos admitted a real degree of failure here and openly stated that the critics were right and he was wrong,"" wrote Shaun King, the writer and Black Lives Matter activist. ""Thank you @SenSanders,"" tweeted John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's former campaign chairman. Bezos thanked Sanders yesterday as well, in a Twitter exchange. For more on the importance of changing corporate behavior, I recommend a recent book by Peter Georgescu, the former C.E.O. of a major advertising agency, as well as coverage and analysis of Senator Elizabeth Warren's new legislation on this topic. Trump's tax fraud. If you're a subscriber to The Times and you're feeling angry this morning about President Trump's brazen tax cheating — as uncovered by a long Times investigation — I know how you feel. But I would also encourage you to make room to feel a small bit of pride, as well.  A long journalistic investigation, involving multiple reporters and editors, is expensive. The reason my colleagues in the newsroom are able to pursue such projects is because of the financial support of subscribers. All of us who work here are grateful for that support. Among the reactions to the investigation: ""If you're wondering how Trump managed to evade the tax authorities for so long, given the brazen acts reported in that NYT piece, note that we've basically stopped prosecuting white-collar crime and tax evasion,"" tweeted The Washington Post's Catherine Rampell. ""Most if not all of the transactions detailed in The Times can be pursued as civil tax fraud by both the federal and New York state governments,"" argues David Cay Johnston, a reporter who has covered Trump's finances for years. ""What we need now are serious investigations by Congress, by the IRS and by New York state and city tax authorities."" At a rally last night, Trump mocked Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused his Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault. As The Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein put it, Trump ""stoked his base w/a new culture war (over sexual assault & growing assertiveness by women) at least partly to distract from airtight evidence he abused the tax code to benefit the super rich (himself). In that way he encapsulated his presidency in a single night."" And as The Times's editorial board writes, Trump's lie-fueled rise has a lot in common with his presidency. ""Trump's willingness to bend the truth — and the rules — in the service of his myth looks less like innocent exaggeration than malicious deception, with a dollop of corruption tossed in for good measure.""

Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/briefing/indonesia-brett-kavanaugh-iran.html,1274," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Blame in Indonesia, a late-night announcement in Washington, an arrest in France. Here's the latest: • What went wrong in Indonesia? As the death toll continues to rise on Sulawesi Island — to 1,407 on Wednesday — officials are trying to understand why an early warning system for earthquakes and tsunamis failed to protect the island. The system was set up in 2008, with seismographic sensors, buoys and tidal gauges. But a combination of vandalism, maintenance shortfalls and infrastructure damaged by the earthquake meant residents didn't receive enough warning to evacuate. _____ • The F.B.I. completes its Kavanaugh report. Early Thursday, the White House sent the Senate the completed F.B.I. investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, saying it was ""confident"" that he would be confirmed to the court. The White House issued its statement around 2:30 a.m., just hours after Senate Republicans moved to schedule a vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Republicans are also stepping up efforts to challenge the veracity of Christine Blasey Ford, Judge Kavanaugh's main accuser, confronting her with a sworn statement from a former boyfriend who questioned some of her testimony last week. But those attacks, along with President Trump's mockery of Dr. Blasey at a campaign rally, could complicate the party's efforts to confirm Judge Kavanaugh by alienating three key Republican senators, Jeff Flake, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. All three condemned the president's remarks about Dr. Blasey. In the meantime, more than 1,000 law professors signed a letter to the Senate saying that Judge Kavanaugh did not have the ""judicial temperament"" for the court. It was published by Times Opinion. _____ • A U.N. court rebukes the U.S. over its Iran sanctions. The International Court of Justice, the U.N.'s highest court, ordered the U.S. to ease sanctions against Iran. Rulings by the court are legally binding, but it has no way of enforcing them. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wasted no time responding, announcing in a largely symbolic move that the U.S. was canceling a 1955 treaty that was the basis for friendly diplomatic exchanges and economic relations with Iran, long before its Islamic revolution turned the two nations into enemies. Above, the Grand Bazaar in Tehran. _____ • A French ""escape king"" is captured.  The escape scene unfolded like a top-notch thriller. Armed men hijacked a helicopter and swept into a French prison yard in July, scooping up Rédoine Faïd, a notorious inmate serving a 25-year sentence for a robbery that left a police officer dead. But now, after an intensive manhunt, Mr. Faïd is back in custody. Above, the apartment building outside Paris where he was arrested. Although no one disputed he had done bad things — this was Mr. Faïd's second prison break — he has gained a somewhat mythical status. Even detectives admit that he is far from an ordinary criminal. • The actress Priyanka Chopra, above center, is also a tech investor, one of the few female celebrities wading into Silicon Valley. Her focus is on companies trying to make a social impact and founded by women. • Entrepreneurs in China worry that the country may be stepping back from the free-market policies that transformed it into the world's No. 2 economy, our Asia technology columnist writes. • Fitness devices have found their way into the tech toolbox used by law enforcement experts to solve crimes. Here's a representative case, from California. •  Here's a snapshot of global markets. The Shanghai stock exchange is closed. • China's actions against Fan Bingbing, above, the country's most famous actress, suggest officials are stepping up enforcement of laws against tax evasion.

Britain's prime minister, Theresa May, closed her Conservative Party's annual conference with an effective speech that used humor and a dance routine to call for unity over the country's exit from the E.U.

News,2018-10-04,"As the line between art and design becomes increasingly blurry, one type of product is emerging as fertile turf for cross-disciplinary collaboration: rugs by artists.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/style/fuzzy-thinking-artist-designed-rugs.html,1263," As the line between art and design becomes increasingly blurry, one type of product is emerging as fertile turf for cross-disciplinary collaboration: rugs by artists. A Manhattan gallery, BravinLee programs, is making bold, graphic rugs from hand-knotted wool and silk by artists such as Christopher Wool, Jonas Wood and James Welling, with more in the pipeline from Deborah Kass, Julio Le Parc and Wangechi Mutu. Joseph Carini Carpets has collaborated on painterly rugs with the ceramic artist Yuki Hayama and graffiti-inspired floor coverings with street artists like DAIN, RAE and Jim Joe. Brintons developed a collection of rugs with the multimedia artist Shezad Dawood last year. The Rug Company, which frequently works with fashion and interior designers, introduced a collection by Jaime Gili this summer. The rug manufacturer Christopher Farr, which has been working with artists for years, made a limited-edition rug with Howard Hodgkin as part of the painter and printmaker's exhibition at the Hepworth Wakefield art gallery in England last year. Now it is at work on limited-edition rugs with Gary Hume, Anish Kapoor, Maya Lin and Kiki Smith for ""Tomorrow's Tigers,"" a fund-raising exhibition organized by Artwise and the World Wildlife Foundation, which will be presented at Sotheby's London in January. Produced in editions of 10, the rugs will start at about $13,000 each. ""The appeal is to match the particular practice of an artist with the complexities and subtleties of weaving,"" said Christopher Farr, a co-founder of his company. ""We wondered whether that would add something, in the way that a print, a bronze, a video, an installation or a performance expresses another facet of that artist's practice."" The fruits of these efforts aren't mere reproductions of an artist's paintings, or rugs designed to coordinate with your furniture — they are intended to stand as artistic pieces in their own right. The process of working with an artist is fundamentally different from working with a designer, said Mr. Farr, who invites artists to invent freely, within his company's capabilities. ""With a designer, I can assert myself a little bit; with an artist, it's a labyrinth of passion and ego,"" Mr. Farr said. ""They stretch you and push you. That tension, that heat, is what attracts me. It's kind of masochistic crazy."" John Post Lee, the co-founder of BravinLee programs, started producing rugs as an outgrowth of his work as an art dealer eight years ago. ""We're interested in this idea of going beyond the white box and creating a transition from just being a traditional art gallery to helping artists make things,"" said Mr. Lee, who works with artists who design the rugs, which are hand-knotted in Nepal. Mr. Lee continued, ""At every step, the artist maintains the control over the project. If at any point they don't like what happens, that's just the end of it."" The current proliferation of artist rugs grows out of a long tradition. In the 1960s Alexander Calder designed a hand-hooked rug with playful creatures and celestial bodies. During the Renaissance, Raphael and Bernaert van Orley worked on elaborate tapestries depicting Christian scenes with the exquisite, lifelike detail of paintings. At auction, the finest examples of antique Middle Eastern and Indian carpets are recognized as works of art and can cost six or seven figures. In comparison, the price of new rugs designed by contemporary artists can seem reasonable, even if they aren't exactly cheap. The Howard Hodgkin rug Christopher Farr produced is about $4,500, and the company's other artist editions run from about $10,000 to $25,000 (about double the price of its other rugs). BravinLee's rugs range from about $3,000 for a wool prayer-size rug by Keltie Ferris to about $30,000 for nine to 10-foot-long silk rugs by Christopher Wool and Jonas Wood. Mr. Wood first approached BravinLee after seeing one of Mr. Wool's rugs at Gladstone Gallery's Upper East Side location. He hoped to buy one for himself. The rug was already sold out, but Mr. Lee asked if Mr. Wood might be interested in making a rug of his own. (Mr. Lee later sold an artist's proof of the Wool rug to Mr. Wood.) ""I was already interested in making usable, functional multiples,"" said Mr. Wood, who has made blankets with House of Voltaire and scarves with Massif Central. ""I like making editions and prints as an extension of my practice. Even though it's very high end, there's still some accessibility to it: Instead of just one painting, there are 30 rugs. People live with it and their dog sleeps on it."" Mr. Hume, the artist, began working with Christopher Farr when he wanted to create a one-off rug as part of an art installation for the 1996 Bienal de São Paulo. More recently, he has developed a series of rugs based on his paintings of doors, as well as a new design for ""Tomorrow's Tigers."" The process of making rugs is ""so physical and elemental,"" Mr. Hume said. ""You have to decide on the length, the cut, the technique of weaving to get what you want,"" he said. ""There's an awful lot of fiddling about, which is very creative and exciting."" Manufacturers say most artist rugs currently sell to art dealers and art collectors. Bill Arning, director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, for instance, bought a white rug with intersecting black lines by James Welling from BravinLee after seeing it at an art fair in Miami. ""I love his work, but I've never been able to afford a painting, so I said, 'This is my chance,'"" Mr. Arning said. ""The image is really powerful and super graphic. I love having it on the floor."" At first, he installed it in his master bedroom. But, later, worried that it was getting worn, he moved it into the guest apartment above his carport. ""With two dogs and two bearded guys, it looked like it was getting a lot of traffic,"" he said. ""It's safer to have it up there."" Buyers of Christopher Farr rugs have included Karl Lagerfeld and Cliff Fong, founder of the Los Angeles interior design firm Matt Blacke. Mr. Fong purchased a rug made by Louise Bourgeois for the den of a client who already owned numerous pieces by the artist. ""Normally, I default to really beautiful old tribal or Oriental rugs that have a worn, faded pile,"" Mr. Fong said. ""To have a rug with a slightly more graphic sensibility and conceptual edge was fun."" Compared to run-of-the-mill contemporary rugs, he added, ""It's just more interesting."" Will a rug designed by Gary Hume or Jonas Wood appreciate in the same way that paintings by those artists might over time? Probably not, said Richard Wright, the owner of Wright auction house, who has hosted numerous auctions devoted to 20th century carpets in recent years (Sotheby's sold a painting by Mr. Wood for just over $2 million in May). Yet they may hold their value and, depending on the trajectory of the artist, it may rise somewhat. ""When fine artists do decorative arts items, they tend to be considered as a different tier,"" Mr. Wright said. A painting is likely to appreciate much more than a carpet, he noted, but, ""I do believe there will be a future market for a Jonas Wood carpet."" However, worrying about the investment potential of artist rugs is largely beside the point — more important is how they look against your hardwood floors. ""They really are the perfect hybrid"" of art and design, Mr. Wright said. ""They look great in your room and make an artist's statement, but still function perfectly well."""
News,2018-10-04,"David Silverman had discovered a gold nugget. It came in the form of party notes kept by Edie Goetz, the late Hollywood socialite and hostess. There in the handwriting of the daughter of Louis B. Mayer were the names of famous guests (Mr. and Mrs. James Stewart; Miss Olivia de Havilland), the food served (suckling pig; potage Saint-Germain) and the movies screened (on Jan. 15, 1983, “Gandhi”) at dinner parties dating back to the 1940s.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/arts/the-man-who-researches-beverly-hills-houses.html,1362," David Silverman had discovered a gold nugget. It came in the form of party notes kept by Edie Goetz, the late Hollywood socialite and hostess. There in the handwriting of the daughter of Louis B. Mayer were the names of famous guests (Mr. and Mrs. James Stewart; Miss Olivia de Havilland), the food served (suckling pig; potage Saint-Germain) and the movies screened (on Jan. 15, 1983, ""Gandhi"") at dinner parties dating back to the 1940s. ""She wrote down the food so she wouldn't repeat it,"" Mr. Silverman said, looking over the notes. He added, with awe, ""The guest list is incredible. There are binders filled with pages like this."" The party notes, obtained from a grandson of Ms. Goetz, would provide just the sort of granular, insider detail to enliven ""300 Delfern Drive,"" the book Mr. Silverman was researching and writing about the Goetz House in Holmby Hills. He had incorporated similar historical tidbits into his previous books, like ""716 North Palm Drive,"" which reprinted a 1934 issue of Motion Picture magazine with interior photos of the house in Beverly Hills, then owned by the actress Adrienne Ames. ""That article was one of the best things I've ever found,"" he said. ""And then the house was also in Elle Décor decades later. So I was able to compare the before and after."" Mr. Silverman has carved out a novel role as the James Boswell of architecture in Beverly Hills and other exclusive Los Angeles enclaves. His vanity books tell of the Tudor revivals and Spanish colonials that played host to Golden Age movie stars and moguls, house histories written for a limited readership of the famous and wealthy who currently own them. The books are not sold on Amazon or at bookstores, but rather meticulously crafted as bespoke tomes for clients seeking to learn more about the rarefied worlds they inhabit. Benedikt Taschen, the German publisher and architecture buff, recently hired Mr. Silverman to write books for two of his homes: the Chemosphere, the John Lautner-designed midcentury masterpiece in the Hollywood Hills, and 1050 Summit Drive, the 1930s Beverly Hills estate built by David O. Selznick, the producer and studio executive. Mr. Taschen is restoring the Selznick home to its original grandeur and hopes Mr. Silverman can assist with the project. So far, Mr. Silverman has completed four books, with seven more in the works. He charges $7,500 and up depending on the time required. He had been moonlighting from his job at Sony Pictures, where for 19 years he worked as a contracts lawyer. Tired of battling with talent agents, and encouraged by the response to his books, however, Mr. Silverman, 50, quit in June to devote full attention to LA House Histories, his one-man operation. ""This is so rewarding and fulfills so many of my interests that I felt I couldn't pass it up,"" he said, adding, ""I don't think anyone in the country does books like this, certainly not in Los Angeles."" Mr. Silverman was sitting with his complete works spread before him in the dining room of a beautiful French Normandy house in Holmby Hills. The stone house, which belonged to his sister, Dana Slatkin, was perched atop a hill, with landscaped grounds tumbling down the slope. Curious about a bronze plaque in her garden that said ""Mille Fleur,"" or thousand flowers, Mr. Silverman decided to research the home and present his findings to Ms. Slatkin as a birthday gift, making his sister his first client. But he got so caught up in the project that he gave her a 157-page hardcover book, which included a newspaper article that explained the sign: The original owner was an accomplished gardener and Francophile. ""All we knew at the time was the house was built in 1926. And we knew who the last owner was because they sold it to us,"" said Ms. Slatkin, a chef and entrepreneur. ""It's an incredible connection to your home and to history. And in a larger existential sense, you realize we're just passing through."" That first book created the template: Each chapter focuses on a previous homeowner, in chronological order, and is padded with archival photos, old newspaper and magazine clippings and anecdotes, culled from online databases like archive.org, libraries, books, vintage issues of Architectural Digest, public records and firsthand sources like relatives. To learn more about the Selznick estate, Mr. Silverman contacted Daniel Selznick, David O. Selznick's last surviving child, now 82 and living in the Motion Picture & TV Relief Fund Home in Woodland Hills, Calif. ""I picked him up and drove him over there, and as we're driving, he's pointing to all these houses: 'This person used to live there. Charlie Chaplin lived across the street from them.' You always hear about these actors and executives, and they're mythic characters. It becomes real."" The more history that's attached to a house, the more famous its owners and houseguests, generally the more involved the project. Mr. Silverman's magnum opus is ""A History of 209 Rockingham Avenue,"" which he subtitled ""The House That Shirley Built,"" referring to Shirley Temple's one-time Brentwood home. The book ballooned to 246 pages after he got involved with members of a Facebook group devoted to the child actress, who flooded him with esoterica, including grainy news footage from a 1967 public auction of the house (the book reprints stills). Mr. Silverman himself tracked down a 1927 aerial photo of Brentwood, interviewed Ms. Temple's first stand-in and invited her and others to a Shirley-themed house party he organized to celebrate the child star's life. He can't resist going down such rabbit holes; indeed, it's become his calling card. ""He's an excellent researcher, and I think he gets great pleasure out of it,"" said Joyce Rey, a veteran Beverly Hills real estate agent who has hired him. When Ms. Rey got the exclusive listing for a $15.9 million home once owned by Elizabeth Taylor, Mr. Silverman unearthed trivia about the actress's time there — a color photo of Ms. Taylor and her two small children taken on the lawn; passages from her memoir talking warmly about the house — that could be used to generate publicity. ""I had always heard that Liz Taylor had lived there,"" Ms. Rey said. ""But David authenticates and enhances the information."" Mr. Silverman has begun to offer such market research beyond the house history books. And while the histories have the plain look of school textbooks (he designs them himself), he recently raised his game. For a client who commissioned him to profile 39 Oakmont Drive, or Los Vientos, a Cliff May-designed house in Brentwood, he hired a bookbinder to create a handsome linen box, which he filled with photographs, architectural drawings and aerial photos. As for his own home, Mr. Silverman lives with his dog in Brentwood, in a 1950s ranch whose undistinguished history, he said, wouldn't make for an interesting book. More fertile territory is in the so-called Platinum Triangle, the wealthy enclaves of Bel Air, Holmby Hills and Beverly Hills, whose large homes, with their celebrity residents over many decades, suggest stories on every palm-tree-lined block. Mr. Silverman left his sister's house and took a reporter for a spin around the area. The Selznick estate that Mr. Taschen was restoring was a five-minute drive through windy, lushly manicured streets. Pulling up to the security gate, Mr. Silverman explained that the property had been subdivided over the years, but he'd tracked down the original plan by Florence Yoch, a landscape designer, that showed ""this vast lawn that sloped down to a tennis court and pool."" He pointed out the second-floor master bedroom, where, he'd learned, on stuffy nights David O. Selznick pushed a button from his bed to open electric windows. A floor below was the projection room, where movies were screened on Sunday nights. Mr. Silverman spoke once again of touring the home with Danny Selznick, who'd grown up there — a memorable experience for the archivist. ""Danny would say, 'This is where Cary Grant sat. Dad had his Oscars on this shelf.' It was just bringing the house to life."" In his own way, Mr. Silverman hoped to create the same effect."

News,2018-10-04,"NEW TAIPEI CITY, Taiwan — As dusk falls at Lehua Night Market, the fluorescent lights flicker on and the hungry customers start trickling in, anxious for a taste of the local delicacies that give this island its reputation as one of Asia’s finest culinary capitals.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/world/asia/taiwan-food-q-texture.html,984," NEW TAIPEI CITY, Taiwan — As dusk falls at Lehua Night Market, the fluorescent lights flicker on and the hungry customers start trickling in, anxious for a taste of the local delicacies that give this island its reputation as one of Asia's finest culinary capitals. Neatly arranged pyramids of plump fish balls. Bowls brimming with tapioca balls bathed in lightly sweetened syrup. Sizzling oyster omelets, hot off the griddle. Deep-fried sweet potato puffs, still dripping with oil. Take a bite of any of these dishes and you'll discover a unique texture. But how exactly do you describe that perfectly calibrated ""mouth feel"" so sought after by local cooks and eaters alike? Slippery? Chewy? Globby? Not exactly the most flattering adjectives in the culinary world. Luckily, the Taiwanese have a word for this texture. Well, actually, it's not a word, it's a letter — one that even non-Chinese speakers can pronounce. It's ""Q."" ""It's difficult to explain what Q means exactly,"" said Liu Yen-ling, a manager at Chun Shui Tang, a popular teahouse chain that claims to have invented tapioca milk tea in Taiwan. ""Basically it means springy, soft, elastic."" Q texture is to Taiwanese what umami is to Japanese and al dente is to Italians — that is, cherished and essential. Around Taiwan, the letter Q can often be glimpsed amid a jumble of Chinese characters on shop signs and food packages and in convenience stores and advertisements. The texture is found in both savory and sweet foods, and is most often used to describe foods that contain some kind of starch like noodles, tapioca pearls and fish balls. If something is really chewy or extra Q, then it could be called QQ. Often, Q and QQ are used interchangeably. ""You can tell if bubble milk tea is good based on how Q the tapioca pearls are,"" Mr. Liu said. ""If the texture is perfect, it can be very satisfying."" [Discuss China's role in the world with New York Times journalists in a new Facebook group here.] André Chiang, a Michelin-star chef and owner of RAW in Taipei, said he had recently been experimenting with the texture at his restaurant, which uses only locally sourced Taiwanese ingredients. One dish he was trying out for the restaurant's new menu featured langoustine, burned onion juice and white tapioca pearls that are cooked to bubbly Q perfection. ""It's like al dente but not quite,"" Mr. Chiang said. ""It's to the tooth but there's also that added element of bounciness."" Q is so well established in Taiwan that many in Hong Kong and over the strait in mainland China use the term as well. Elsewhere in Asia, it is a familiar texture, though the term itself may not be used. Tteok-bokki, a Korean stir-fried rice cake, and mochi, a Japanese rice cake, for example, could also be considered Q. In Western cuisine, the texture is less commonly found, though one could describe foods like gummy bears and certain kinds of pasta as Q. The origins of the term Q are unclear. Some say it comes from the Taiwanese Hokkien word k'iu. Say Q to an elderly Taiwanese, and chances are he or she will know the term. But no one can quite explain how and when the 17th letter of the English alphabet became shorthand for describing the texture of tapioca balls and gummy candies. With the rapid proliferation of bubble milk tea shops and other Asian snack shops across the United States over the years, there has emerged a broader appreciation for this once ""exotic"" texture, even if the vocabulary to describe that texture has not exactly caught up. ""Most of my American friends like bubble milk tea,"" said Tina Fong, a co-founder of Taipei Eats, which offers food tours around the city. ""But when there's Q texture in a savory dish, it can still be a bit strange to them. It really depends on the person."" When it comes to the Chinese language, the letter Q is surprisingly versatile, and not used only to describe food. For example, many in China and Taiwan are familiar with 阿Q, or Ah Q, the protagonist of one of China's most famous novellas by the writer Lu Xun. After the publication of ""The True Story of Ah Q"" in the early 1920s, Ah Q became a symbol of the backwardness of Chinese culture. While the story's narrator confesses to not knowing the origin of Ah Q's name, some scholars say Lu Xun may have chosen Q as an implicit reference to its homonym queue, or the braided ponytail that Chinese men were forced to wear to show their subjugation to the ruling Qing dynasty. Some have also interpreted Lu Xun's Q as a pictogram of a head with a pigtail. There are many other uses for the term Q in Chinese as well. It could be used, for example, as shorthand for the English word cute, or to refer to the once-popular QQ messaging service from Tencent or the QQ minicar model from the Chinese carmaker Chery. ""Whether Q may be considered a Chinese character or not, it certainly has become a part of the Chinese writing system,"" Victor Mair, a professor of Chinese language at the University of Pennsylvania, once wrote in a blog post. Among Taiwanese, the appreciation for Q texture starts at a young age. On a recent sticky evening at Lehua Night Market, crowds ambled through the carnival-like pedestrian street, which was lined on both sides with vendors hawking things like hats, cellphone cases and, of course, delicious snacks. A gaggle of mini revelers zeroed in on a stand with a neon sign that read ""QQ popsicles."" Asked why Q texture was so appealing to Taiwanese, Lu Wei-chen, the owner of the stand, smiled as she handed a bright red jelly bar to a delighted toddler. ""It's simple,"" she said. ""When you eat it, you will be in a good mood."""
News,2018-10-04,"PARIS — As President Emmanuel Macron presses ahead with the most business-friendly overhaul of the French labor market in decades, his popularity with many of his countrymen has gone into a tailspin. Consumer confidence is falling. A nascent recovery is cooling off. Unemployment has been stuck above 9 percent for months.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/business/economy/mcaron-popularity-tax-cuts-working-class.html,1255," PARIS — As President Emmanuel Macron presses ahead with the most business-friendly overhaul of the French labor market in decades, his popularity with many of his countrymen has gone into a tailspin. Consumer confidence is falling. A nascent recovery is cooling off. Unemployment has been stuck above 9 percent for months. And then there was the encounter with the gardener. In an exchange that went viral on social media, Mr. Macron was seen as lecturing an out-of-work gardener in Paris to look harder for a job. ""If I crossed the street, I'd find you one,"" he told the man, prompting a Twitter storm of insults aimed at Mr. Macron, a former investment banker. That is hardly the vision of France, or of his presidency, that Mr. Macron hoped for when he swept into office 18 months ago with a pledge to revitalize Europe's third-biggest economy by pursuing work-force reforms that had been stalled for more than a decade. His approval ratings have slumped, and on Wednesday his interior minister resigned, the third cabinet member to quit in six weeks. Amid the turmoil, the government is trying to shore up support by giving cash back to the working class — with tax breaks next year worth 6 billion euros ($6.9 billion) for middle- and low-income earners — while reassuring investors that his designs for a ""new French prosperity"" are on track. Mr. Macron remains unbending in his attitude — and his criticism that French society must adapt to thrive. ""I will not change course,"" Mr. Macron told the French newspaper Journal du Dimanche. ""We're in a moment when many political leaders before me have yielded,"" he added. ""But it's more necessary than ever to move ahead with reforms."" His remarks dovetailed with a public relations blitz by some members of his cabinet in recent days, and underscored the stakes for Mr. Macron as he unwinds business regulations and changes the parameters of the welfare state. Mr. Macron has insisted that painful economic measures must come first, including a revamping of France's strict labor code and budget cuts to keep the government's deficit within European rules, to seed dynamism. Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister, said abandoning pro-business policies would lead to a ""dead end."" The 2019 budget also includes an €18.8 billion reduction in payroll and other business taxes to encourage hiring and investment. ""But French people are skeptical,"" Mr. Le Maire told reporters last week. ""We need to explain that this new model will be successful, and that it takes time before seeing the full benefits."" If convincing French voters is an uphill battle, it is especially challenging for Mr. Macron, who is viewed internationally as a dynamic European leader. His policies at home have yet to help most households. In his first year, he delivered tax breaks to corporations and to France's wealthiest 10 percent, earning him a reputation for favoring the rich. Purchasing power fell for the bottom 5 percent of households, while the majority in the middle, about 70 percent, were largely unaffected, according to the French Economic Observatory, an independent think tank. Changes to the labor code intended to stoke hiring have trimmed unemployment slowly. Joblessness has fallen to 9.3 percent, from 10.1 percent when Mr. Macron was elected, but is still more than double the German unemployment rate. Although a nascent recovery before he took office helped generate jobs, growth has cooled recently to a 1.7 percent annual pace, as it has in the rest of the eurozone. Mr. Macron promised voters that he could whittle unemployment to 7 percent by the next presidential election in 2022. To meet that target, the economy would have to grow by at least 1.7 percent in each of the next four years, which is by no means certain, according to the French Economic Observatory. Mr. Macron's economic policies have encouraged companies like Facebook and Fujitsu to increase investments in France. But his style — the confrontation with the gardener is a case in point — has alienated him from working-class voters and older citizens, who view him as out of touch and inclined to favor big business at the expense of workers. Mr. Macron's 2019 budget tries to make some amends. It pivots toward those left behind in the previous round of tax cuts, targeting €6 billion in housing and payroll tax cuts at the working class, on top of reductions in employee health care contributions and unemployment insurance payments. A separate plan would set aside €8 billion to tackle rising poverty with aid and job-training programs for disadvantaged youths under 25. The budget is aimed at ""making work pay"" by leaving more money in workers' pockets. But to keep the deficit in check, Mr. Macron is also trimming benefits for those not working, and cutting over 40,000 jobs in the public sector. Increases in pensions and family benefits would be capped at 0.3 percent a year, well below the 1.8 percent annual average inflation rate. Although 300,000 pensioners who make less than €1,200 a month will be exempted, many older voters are angry about those cuts and are taking to the streets in protest. There are 15 million pensioners in France, and three out of four voted for Mr. Macron in the second round of balloting. The government will also tighten unemployment insurance eligibility and reshape professional training programs to push the jobless into work more quickly. Despite high unemployment, nearly 330,000 jobs are unfilled as employers scramble to find programmers, drivers and other skilled workers. To spur job creation, a new policy aims to increase the number of medium-size businesses in France, which have struggled to grow at the same rate as in neighboring countries. These include cutting corporate social security taxes, and reducing requirements for companies to have union representatives. Yet even the business community has been grousing about Mr. Macron's changes. Some companies are upset about the government's plans to limit the use of short-term contracts, arguing that the policy ignores the needs of the modern workplace. Employers relied on short-term contracts during the financial crisis. The sort of innovative industry that France now seeks — whether digital or manufacturing-based — needs agile and fluid workers, business groups contend. Mr. Macron took pains on a tour of the French Antilles last weekend to appear more down to earth, glad-handing the public and standing in the rain for selfies with smiling crowds. ""I'm not perfect. There are things that need to be corrected,"" he told the French newspaper Le Monde. He also remains adamant that his approach will benefit younger voters — including the 25-year-old gardener who couldn't find work. Mr. Macron listened to his complaint that horticulture jobs were hard to find and gave a rapid-fire response: Be flexible. ""If you're willing and motivated, in hotels, cafes and restaurants, construction, there's not a single place I go where they don't say they're looking for people. Not one — it's true!"" Mr. Macron told the man. As it turns out, the man found work as a bus driver, which Mr. Macron's supporters said showed that jobs were available. The French president is ""taking a gamble,"" said Éric Heyer, the director of analysis and forecasting at the French Economic Observatory. ""By easing taxes on the middle class, he's trying to get away from this image that he's 'president of the rich.'"" ""The measures will either deepen inequality or help growth,"" Mr. Heyer added. ""But nothing is guaranteed to be a success, so it is unclear if he will win or lose the bet."""
briefing,2018-10-04, (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/briefing/brett-kavanaugh-south-carolina-new-york-yankees.html,1320,"  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: Overnight, the White House sent the results of the F.B.I.'s investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate, and expressed confidence that the material wouldn't derail his Supreme Court nomination. A few hours earlier, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, took steps that would set an initial vote on the nomination for Friday. The moves came despite complaints from Democrats that investigators did not interview key witnesses. But Mr. McConnell has come to see his nearly singular responsibility as adding conservatives to the federal courts. ""There is no chance in the world that they're going to scare us out of doing our duty,"" he said on Wednesday. • ""A lack of judicial temperament"": Over 1,000 law professors signed a letter opposing Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation. • A guide: Here's an overview of the nomination's twists and turns. Republicans have stepped up attacks on Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, with some seizing on a sworn statement by a former boyfriend of Dr. Blasey to question her story. After President Trump mocked Dr. Blasey's testimony, three Republicans who are crucial to the vote expressed condemnation. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska called the comments ""wholly inappropriate and in my view unacceptable."" In recent polls, 45 percent of Americans have said they believe Dr. Blasey was truthful, while 33 percent said Judge Kavanaugh was. That may have consequences for Republicans in the midterm elections. • A letter to Dr. Blasey: Connie Chung, a longtime television news anchor, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that she was sexually assaulted 50 years ago. The political stakes are high this year. But most eligible Americans will probably stay home on Election Day. Just over a third participated in the 2014 midterm elections, the lowest share since 1942. People cite two main reasons for not voting: They are either too busy or not interested, according to Census Bureau data. • A push to vote: A small army of black women are using networks originally forged in segregation to bolster turnout. Their efforts could help Democrats flip House seats in the South. Taxes are increasing, regulations are stiffening, and state-controlled companies are on the rise as Beijing turns to greater government control. Some academics are calling for private firms to be abolished. President Xi Jinping has increasingly sought to cement his dominance, but the moves on business may spell problems for China amid slowing growth and pressure from the trade war. • The view from the U.S.: Vice President Mike Pence, in a speech on Thursday, is expected to accuse China of aggression and meddling. On the eve of the new season, the New York City Ballet has been forced to reassess its culture. In the past nine months, three principal male dancers have been forced out amid accusations that they shared texts of sexually explicit images of women, and Peter Martins, the company's longtime leader, abruptly retired amid an investigation into reports of physical and sexual abuse. • The reaction: The ballet company has begun implementing safeguards now common in corporate America. • Trade talks between Canada and the U.S. shocked many Canadians, and some say they won't be quickly be forgotten. ""I think that's now deep in our psyche — the way we were treated by this president,"" a former ambassador to the U.S. said. • In tight races around the country, Republican candidates suddenly find themselves having to defend President Trump's tax law to angry constituents. • A 60-year-old bottle of single malt whisky sold for a record $1.1 million. • U.S. stocks were up on Wednesday. Here's a snapshot of global markets today. Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Froze your credit? Here's how to thaw it. • Get up close with wildlife: Safely feed hummingbirds by hand. • Recipe of the day: Trying to eat more fish? Pair it with shiitakes and a combination of garlic, ginger and scallions. • ""A very old, boring and often told hit piece"" President Trump criticized a New York Times investigation into the origins of his wealth, but did not deny the report outright. • Noise wasn't gunfire, but crowd's panic was real  A stampede at a festival in New York has raised questions about the city's ability to safely handle mass panic. • A deadly police shooting in South Carolina Seven officers were shot and at least one was killed in one of the worst attacks on U.S. police in recent years. • Get ready for a Yankees-Red Sox showdown A first-inning home run by Aaron Judge helped the Yankees dispatch the Oakland Athletics the American League wild-card game. They'll face Boston in a division series starting on Friday. • Tragedy in the tattoo parlor  Freddy Negrete learned his craft in state prison in the 1970s. Today, he works at a parlor frequented by Lady Gaga and Adele, where his art has helped him cope with grief. Here's more from this week's Style section. • Living up to its title A debut novelist, Hank Green, is No. 1 with ""An Absolutely Remarkable Thing"" on our hardcover fiction list. You can find all of our best-seller lists here. • Best of late-night TV Jimmy Kimmel dismissed Wednesday's nationwide emergency alert, saying he doesn't need it. ""I already get terrifying presidential alerts on my phone — they're called the news. They come every day."" • Quotation of the day ""There were a lot of things being said about my mother that day, a lot of it bad stuff and depressing. But the best one was 'Hey, Canha, your mother's meatballs aren't that good.' "" — Mark Canha, a first baseman with the Oakland Athletics, on fan abuse at Yankee Stadium on Mother's Day. • The Times, in other words Here's an image of today's front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. • What we're reading Kristen Kozinski, our information security trainer, recommends this article from Motherboard: ""Malicious actors have found easy money persuading cellphone companies to switch a customer's number to another SIM card, giving them the key to their victim's valuable online accounts. This piece offers an emotional look at the victims, and offers guidance on how to protect yourself."" Dan Rather, a longtime American television news anchor was returning from dinner at a friend's Manhattan apartment on this day in 1986 when a man demanded, ""Kenneth, what is the frequency?"" Told he had the wrong person, the man punched and kicked Mr. Rather, still yelling the question. Mr. Rather dashed into a building and was rescued by a doorman and building superintendent. The police chalked it up to mistaken identity. Some people wondered if Mr. Rather had imagined it. It was unclear if one or two men had attacked. Meanwhile, ""What's the frequency, Kenneth?"" became a U.S. pop catchphrase. The band R.E.M. wrote a song by that name. In 1997, it emerged that William Tager, a North Carolina man in prison by then, was Mr. Rather's assailant. In 1994, Mr. Tager had shot and killed a television stagehand, saying the media was beaming messages into his brain. Shown photographs, Mr. Rather recognized him. Mr. Tager was released from prison in 2010. His whereabouts is unknown. Nancy Wartik wrote today's Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

More speakers will be announced in the coming weeks. Find out more about the conference. The online auction platform contends that Amazon employees used its internal messaging system to poach top sellers. More from Karen Weise of the NYT: The e-commerce site said it was tipped off to the situation last month by an eBay seller who had been contacted by an Amazon representative. An early investigation by eBay found at least 50 Amazon representatives had sent hundreds of solicitation messages over the last several years. Some messages appear to suggest the Amazon employees knew they were violating eBay's terms of service. ""EBay does scan for key terms and they don't exactly like us poking around,"" one message read. Other used terms like ""a-m-a-z-o-n"" or ""A.M.Z.N.,"" perhaps to evade detection. EBay has issued a cease-and-desist letter, while Amazon says it is investigating the claims. More Amazon news: As it raises its minimum wage, Amazon will scrap monthly bonuses and stock awards for hourly workers. David Leonhardt of the NYT asks whether the pay policy represents a turning point where corporate executives begin to reject pure greed. A start-up called Elemental Technologies makes powerful video-processing hardware. Its devices — which are assembled by a company called Super Micro Computer and used by organizations including the Defense Department and the C.I.A. — caught the eye of Amazon, which considered buying the company. But during due diligence, reports Bloomberg Businessweek, Amazon discovered something startling: Nested on the servers' motherboards, the testers found a tiny microchip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, that wasn't part of the boards' original design. Amazon reported the discovery to U.S. authorities, sending a shudder through the intelligence community. Then: During the ensuing top-secret probe, which remains open more than three years later, investigators determined that the chips allowed the attackers to create a stealth doorway into any network that included the altered machines. Multiple people familiar with the matter say investigators found that the chips had been inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China. Carmakers gather at the Paris Motor Show. It's a turbulent time: American automakers' sales are stagnant, international manufacturers are confronting U.S. tariffs, and the rise of electric vehicles and autonomous driving loom over the industry. The E.U.'s chief Brexit negotiator meets with Ireland's leader. Topic A is finding a compromise on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, a major Brexit sticking point. Costco reports fourth-quarter results. Analysts expect a rise in revenue and same-store sales, buoyed by accelerating membership growth and price cuts. Toyota and Honda have both announced partnerships on autonomous vehicles — showing how difficult the technology is to develop, even for the world's biggest automakers. Toyota is setting up a joint venture with SoftBank for driverless vehicle services, like meal delivery and hospital shuttles. And Honda agreed to invest $2.75 billion in G.M.'s Cruise unit, taking a 5.7 percent stake. Driverless cars promise to redefine the multibillion-dollar auto industry, and the costs of bringing them to market are too big for almost any company to handle independently. ""SoftBank alone and automakers alone can't do everything,"" Junichi Miyakawa, SoftBank's chief technology officer, said. The danger, as Anjani Trivedi of Bloomberg Opinion writes, is that the technology might never match its hype. Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a bill yesterday to limit the size of American financial giants.

More speakers will be announced in the coming weeks. Find out more about the conference. The online auction platform contends that Amazon employees used its internal messaging system to poach top sellers. More from Karen Weise of the NYT: The e-commerce site said it was tipped off to the situation last month by an eBay seller who had been contacted by an Amazon representative. An early investigation by eBay found at least 50 Amazon representatives had sent hundreds of solicitation messages over the last several years. Some messages appear to suggest the Amazon employees knew they were violating eBay's terms of service. ""EBay does scan for key terms and they don't exactly like us poking around,"" one message read. Other used terms like ""a-m-a-z-o-n"" or ""A.M.Z.N.,"" perhaps to evade detection. EBay has issued a cease-and-desist letter, while Amazon says it is investigating the claims. More Amazon news: As it raises its minimum wage, Amazon will scrap monthly bonuses and stock awards for hourly workers. David Leonhardt of the NYT asks whether the pay policy represents a turning point where corporate executives begin to reject pure greed. A start-up called Elemental Technologies makes powerful video-processing hardware. Its devices — which are assembled by a company called Super Micro Computer and used by organizations including the Defense Department and the C.I.A. — caught the eye of Amazon, which considered buying the company. But during due diligence, reports Bloomberg Businessweek, Amazon discovered something startling: Nested on the servers' motherboards, the testers found a tiny microchip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, that wasn't part of the boards' original design. Amazon reported the discovery to U.S. authorities, sending a shudder through the intelligence community. Then: During the ensuing top-secret probe, which remains open more than three years later, investigators determined that the chips allowed the attackers to create a stealth doorway into any network that included the altered machines. Multiple people familiar with the matter say investigators found that the chips had been inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China. Carmakers gather at the Paris Motor Show. It's a turbulent time: American automakers' sales are stagnant, international manufacturers are confronting U.S. tariffs, and the rise of electric vehicles and autonomous driving loom over the industry. The E.U.'s chief Brexit negotiator meets with Ireland's leader. Topic A is finding a compromise on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, a major Brexit sticking point. Costco reports fourth-quarter results. Analysts expect a rise in revenue and same-store sales, buoyed by accelerating membership growth and price cuts. Toyota and Honda have both announced partnerships on autonomous vehicles — showing how difficult the technology is to develop, even for the world's biggest automakers. Toyota is setting up a joint venture with SoftBank for driverless vehicle services, like meal delivery and hospital shuttles. And Honda agreed to invest $2.75 billion in G.M.'s Cruise unit, taking a 5.7 percent stake. Driverless cars promise to redefine the multibillion-dollar auto industry, and the costs of bringing them to market are too big for almost any company to handle independently. ""SoftBank alone and automakers alone can't do everything,"" Junichi Miyakawa, SoftBank's chief technology officer, said. The danger, as Anjani Trivedi of Bloomberg Opinion writes, is that the technology might never match its hype. Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a bill yesterday to limit the size of American financial giants. (It was 10 years to the day since the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which saved banks after the 2008 crisis, was passed.) The bill proposes breaking up financial institutions with exposure to more than 3 percent of America's G.D.P. — equivalent to about $584 billion in assets.

briefing,2018-10-05,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/briefing/brett-kavanaugh-russia-france.html,1342," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. U.S. Senate Republicans align, the West goes after Russia and handicappers speculate about the Nobel Peace Prize. Here's the latest: • Kavanaugh confirmation appears near. Deeply divided over the results of an F.B.I. investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the U.S. Senate moved uneasily toward a Friday morning vote to determine whether President Trump's nominee will join the Supreme Court. Republican leaders were increasingly confident of Judge Kavanaugh's chances, but with four senators still undecided, his confirmation was not assured. Above, Senator Patrick Leahy arriving to view the sole copy of the F.B.I. report. Judge Kavanaugh himself, in an extraordinary op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, tried to reassure those undecided senators that he had the right judicial temperament. And in an unusual rebuke from a former member of the court, Justice John Paul Stevens, 98, said he had reluctantly concluded that Judge Kavanaugh was too prejudiced to effectively sit on the bench. _____ • More charges against Russia. European officials accused Russia of cyberattacks on an organization investigating the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal. They also pointed to interference with a Malaysian investigation into the passenger plane shot down over Ukraine in 2014. Officials in London also revealed an attempted hack on the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office by Russian military intelligence officers in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of Mr. Skripal and his daughter. Those were all part of a coordinated move by Western officials in accusing Russia of a series of cyberattacks that targeted investigations of Russian wrongdoing around the world. Above, equipment said to have been used by Russian hackers. _____ • ""I will not change course.""  Consumer confidence is falling in France. So are its leader's poll numbers. But President Emmanuel Macron is determined to press ahead with the most business-friendly overhaul of the French labor market in decades. And he promises tax cuts and other benefits for middle- and low-income earners. _____ • Privatize the war in Afghanistan? Erik Prince, the American mercenary executive, above, has been meeting with top officials in Kabul to sell them his vision of privatizing the war in Afghanistan. But President Ashraf Ghani has refused to meet with Mr. Prince, the founder of Blackwater, the security firm infamous for killing civilians in Iraq. ""Foreign mercenaries will never be allowed in this country,"" Mr. Ghani said. Still, Mr. Prince's pitch to deploy contractors instead of U.S. soldiers seems to be striking a chord at a particularly sensitive moment. The Afghan security forces they support are dying in record numbers in clashes with a resurgent Taliban ahead of parliamentary elections this month. _____ • The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced today. Who will get it? There are more than 300 nominees this year, and the process of choosing a winner is famously opaque, with no public shortlist and no insight into what the independent Norwegian committee is looking for. Regardless, some bookmakers have bets on President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, for working toward denuclearization. Another guess is the U.N. Refugee Agency. So far this week, the Swedish Academy, which is responsible for the rest of the prizes, has handed out awards for medicine, physics and chemistry. • Danske Bank of Denmark says it is cooperating with a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into suspected money laundering by Russian criminals at its branch in Estonia. Above, bank officials at a news conference. • What are household chores worth? About $1.6 trillion a year in Britain, according to a study. Among the top unpaid contributions to society are child care, cooking and driving young ones around. • The E.U. is setting up a payments system to shield non-American companies from the U.S. sanctions against trade with Iran. The project faces technical challenges — and resistance from the Trump administration. • International travelers would be forgiven for thinking Kennedy International Airport looks nothing like a gateway to the grand metropolis that is New York. On Thursday, officials unveiled a $13 billion solution to the airport's mess, including plans for two new terminals. •  Here's a snapshot of global markets. Markets in China are closed today. • Scars from the Troubles, the conflict that began in Northern Ireland 50 years ago, still run deep, and Brexit negotiations have opened new wounds. Above, a British soldier in Londonderry in 1969. [The New York Times] • Sanctions on a Turkish company for doing business with North Korea are intended as a tough signal to Pyongyang ahead of a visit by Mike Pompeo, the U.S. secretary of state. [The New York Times] • The Hamas leader in Gaza, Yehya Sinwar, told an Israeli newspaper that war was in ""no one's interest,"" but warned that under current circumstances, ""an explosion is inevitable."" [The New York Times] • The Trump administration's first public counterterrorism strategy claimed a new approach. But it embraced many plans of Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. [The New York Times] • The cries for help heard by rescuers on a devastated Indonesian island after last week's earthquake and tsunami have mostly gone silent. [The New York Times] • Burst bubbles: A winery in Italy lost 8,000 gallons of prosecco after one of its fermentation tanks exploded. [CBS] Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Here's the fastest way to charge your phone and keep it charged. • You shouldn't use Facebook to log in to other sites. • Recipe of the day: Celebrate the weekend by making a skillet brownie with chocolate ganache frosting. • Are Neanderthals helping to keep us well? Scientists have found evidence that a tiny bit of genetic code carried by the descendants of ancestors from Asia and Europe may offer protection from viruses — including those related to influenza, herpes and H.I.V. • It has been a career-defining time for Simona Halep of Romania. At 27, she is enjoying her No. 1 ranking since winning her first Grand Slam at the French Open. She talked to The Times about her big year. • After Rosa Van Been married Joseph Bouglione in a lion cage, the Bouglione family bought the Cirque d'Hiver in Paris, more than 80 years ago. Mrs. Bouglione died recently at 107. The circus is still operating. Last week, Scrabble players got some good news when the Merriam-Webster Official Scrabble Players Dictionary added 300 new words. (Think yowza, bibimbap, ok, zen and qapik, an Azerbaijani coin.) It was the latest chapter in the game's long history. Its inventor, Alfred Butts, first called the game Lexiko. Then Criss Cross Words. At one point, he simply called it, It. He modified rules, added a playing board. Toy manufacturers were unmoved. ""After giving your game our very careful review and consideration, we do not feel we would be interested in adding this item to our line,"" read a letter to Mr. Butts from the Milton Bradley company. Almost certainly the company regretted turning down the game, which became Scrabble in 1948 after an individual investor got involved. Despite competition from online games like Words With Friends, the board version remains popular, selling an estimated one to two million sets annually in North America. It has been translated into some 29 languages, including German. This reporter can number among her proud achievements petitioning Words With Friends to add ""ew"" to its word list. Last week, ""ew"" also became an acceptable word in Scrabble (along with another two-letter word, ""ok,"" opening up new strategic possibilities).

News,2018-10-05,"The unemployment rate fell to a nearly five-decade low in September, punctuating a remarkable rebound in the 10 years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off a global financial crisis.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/business/economy/jobs-report.html,1446," The unemployment rate fell to a nearly five-decade low in September, punctuating a remarkable rebound in the 10 years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off a global financial crisis. By almost any measure, the American economy is humming. Gross domestic product is on pace for its best year since the housing bubble of the mid-2000s. Consumers and businesses are the most confident they have been in years, if not decades. Stock market indexes are near record highs. The latest milestone came in a Friday report from the Labor Department: The unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent last month, the lowest since December 1969, when hundreds of thousands of working-age Americans were serving in Vietnam. ""I view this as the strongest labor market in a generation,"" said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the career site Glassdoor. ""These really are the good times."" The turnaround from a decade ago is hard to overstate. In September 2008, American employers cut 443,000 jobs as the financial system collapsed around them. More than seven million more jobs evaporated in the months that followed. Even when the hemorrhaging stopped, shellshocked executives were slow to bring back laid-off workers, sparking fears of a ""jobless recovery."" But when the hiring engine finally kicked back into gear, it did so in historic fashion. The 134,000 jobs added in September made it the 96th consecutive month of growth — eight full years, double the previous record. Employers have added close to 20 million jobs during that streak. (September's growth, a modest slowdown from August, would probably have been stronger absent the effects of Hurricane Florence, which struck the Carolinas in the middle of the month.) Crucially, the recovery is reaching groups that struggled in the early years of the recovery. The unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics are both near all-time lows. Teenagers, less-educated workers and disabled Americans have also made progress in recent months. And anecdotal reports suggest that companies are becoming more willing to hire people with criminal records or to waive drug-testing requirements. Republicans are hoping the strong economy will help them hold off a potential ""blue wave"" of Democratic victories in next month's midterm elections. Friday's report was one of the last before Election Day, and President Trump wasted no time before cheering the news on Twitter. It isn't clear, however, that economic data will have much effect at the polls. Surveys show that views of the economy are split along partisan lines, with Democrats and even many independents expressing less optimism than Republicans. Indeed, the decade-long economic rebound from the financial crisis has been impressive more for its durability than for its strength. Millions of Americans remain stuck in part-time or temporary work, and many of the middle-class jobs wiped out by the recession have never returned. As a share of the population, employment remains well below its 2000 peak, a gap only partly explained by the aging population. Most significant, strong hiring has not yet translated into robust raises for many workers. Average hourly earnings rose 2.8 percent in September from a year earlier, down from 2.9 percent in August and well below the growth that economists would usually expect with the unemployment rate this low. But there are signs that wage growth could at long last be gaining momentum. Before last month's hiccup, the pace of growth had been drifting upward. Industries where labor is especially tight, such as construction and technology, are seeing wages rise faster. Workers at the bottom of the earnings ladder, who were left behind early in the recovery, are now seeing particularly strong growth: Amazon announced this week that it would raise the minimum wage for its employees in the United States to $15 an hour. Amy Glaser, a senior vice president at the staffing firm Adecco, heard the Amazon news on television while preparing for a meeting with a rival e-commerce firm. Ms. Glaser helps companies hire for the holiday season, a task that Amazon had just made even more difficult for them. ""There was definitely a feeling of concern,"" she said. ""It puts increased pressure on them in a market where they already knew they were going to have to make significant adjustments on wages."" Higher pay alone may not be enough. The combination of a tight labor market and rapidly growing online sales has made the competition for warehouse workers particularly fierce this year. Ms. Glaser said companies were hiring earlier, easing job requirements and giving workers more control over their schedules, a big shift in an industry that has traditionally expected workers to show up when and where they are needed. ""The demand for workers is higher than ever, and the supply just isn't out there right now,"" Ms. Glaser said. Christine Specht is dealing with just that challenge. Ms. Specht runs Cousins Subs, a Wisconsin sandwich chain that is struggling to find workers as it looks to expand into the Chicago area. Cousins has raised wages in recent years but still pays well under the $15 an hour that Amazon and other big companies are promising. As the operator of a small chain in a competitive industry, Ms. Specht said, she is reluctant to raise prices in order to pay employees more. ""We can't always run to the menu board every time there's a cost increase in running our business,"" Ms. Specht said. ""That's kind of a last resort."" Instead, the company is looking for other ways to attract workers. Cousins has ramped up its training program to help workers advance into management, offered referral bonuses to employees who help recruit their friends and staged ""hiring blitz days,"" when executives set up shop in a restaurant and interview candidates on the spot. More than anything, they are trying to move quickly. ""You can't sit on applications anymore, because people have options and they will go somewhere else,"" Ms. Specht said. Many economists think the shortage of workers will cause job growth to slow in the months ahead. But others argue that there is still room for the labor pool to expand, as employers become willing to consider candidates they would have overlooked earlier and as higher wages attract people who had been choosing not to work. ""You did see something like that in the late '90s, which is probably the closest analogue,"" said Jeremy Schwartz, an economist for Credit Suisse in New York. ""In a sufficiently strong labor market, you really were pulling people from the sidelines."" It is unclear whether that can happen again. In the 1990s, baby boomers were in their prime working years; today, they are retiring at a rate of 10,000 a day. The number of people being hired from outside the labor force is near an all-time high. Yet the participation rate — the share of adults working or actively looking for work — has been essentially flat in recent years. ""You do see prime-working-age individuals coming back into the labor force,"" said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""But the demographic forces are so fierce that it provides a complete offset."" Policymakers at the Federal Reserve are watching warily for signs that the shrinking pool of labor is leading the economy to overheat, as competition for workers drives up wages and, ultimately, inflation. That could force the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly than planned, which could cause a recession. Yields on United States government bonds have risen sharply in recent days, a sign that investors expect inflation — and interest rates — to rise in coming years. Those concerns have also filtered through to the stock market, where major indexes fell again on Friday after dropping on Thursday. But in a speech in Boston earlier this week, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said he didn't see the tight labor market translating into faster inflation. Friday's report, which showed the unemployment rate falling without wage growth accelerating, is unlikely to change that view, Ms. Meyer said. With the economy in such strong shape, attention on Wall Street has turned to what could bring the good times to an end. Fed rate increases are one popular answer. A trade war is another. Economists and business leaders have warned for months that Mr. Trump's tariffs could threaten the recovery, particularly in manufacturing. There is little sign of that so far, however. That sector added 18,000 jobs in September, and the revised figures erased what was initially reported as a small decline in August. Other measures of the industrial sector likewise show continued growth. ""We really don't have any negative impact from the tariffs yet,"" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist for the consulting firm RSM."

News,2018-10-05,"Q. Does coenzyme Q10 help to reduce muscular issues and other negative side effects associated with statins? And if so, should doctors give this information to patients when statins are prescribed?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/well/live/does-coenzyme-q10-reduce-statin-related-muscle-aches.html,397," Q. Does coenzyme Q10 help to reduce muscular issues and other negative side effects associated with statins? And if so, should doctors give this information to patients when statins are prescribed? A. Coenzyme Q10, a popular dietary supplement marketed as CoQ10 ""to promote heart health,"" probably does not reduce statin-induced muscle problems. In 1957, researchers at the University of Wisconsin discovered a molecule that helps muscle cells generate energy. Today, that molecule is commonly known as coenzyme Q10. In 1978, investigators, including Dr. Michael Brown and Dr. Joseph Goldstein, who would go on to win the Nobel Prize, noted that cholesterol and coenzyme Q10 are synthesized by the same biochemical pathway. As a result, statins not only lower cholesterol levels, they also deplete the body's stores of coenzyme Q10. This finding renewed interest in coenzyme Q10. Was its depletion the cause of statin-induced muscle aches? If so, could restoring coenzyme Q10 to normal levels with supplements counteract these problems? This theory attracted many proponents, including Dr. Brown, who in 1989 filed a patent on coenzyme Q10 as a treatment for statin-induced muscle problems. In the ensuing years, coenzyme Q10 was studied extensively as a treatment for statin-induced muscle problems. But the studies yielded conflicting results. In 2015, the Lipid and Blood Pressure Meta-analysis Collaboration Group combined data from six randomized controlled trials of coenzyme Q10 as a treatment for statin-induced muscle problems. Their meta-analysis of 302 patients concluded that coenzyme Q10 was not beneficial. A subsequent randomized controlled trial of coenzyme Q10 in 41 patients with proven statin-induced muscle problems reached the same conclusion. Rigorous studies of coenzyme Q10 for other medical conditions — such as heart failure, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease — have also found it to be ineffective. Some argue, with some justification, that the studies of coenzyme Q10 were not large enough, or were not long enough, or used various preparations and doses of coenzyme Q10. Still, considering the preponderance of evidence, there is no proof coenzyme Q10 helps prevent statin-induced muscle problems. Like all dietary supplements, coenzyme Q10 is not regulated as a drug by the Food and Drug Administration, so there may be important differences between different manufacturer's products. Side effects may also occur, including insomnia and upset stomach, and it may interact with drugs such as blood thinners, insulin and certain chemotherapies. If you do take coenzyme Q10, seek your doctor's advice. Do you have a health question? Ask Well"
News,2018-10-05,"An 1890s Brooklyn brownstone with gilded details. A Soho loft with picture windows. A Lower Manhattan apartment with an automated garage. A house in the Hamptons with a pool, tennis and basketball courts — even a chipping green. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/nyregion/paul-manafort-property-forfeiture.html,843," An 1890s Brooklyn brownstone with gilded details. A Soho loft with picture windows. A Lower Manhattan apartment with an automated garage. A house in the Hamptons with a pool, tennis and basketball courts — even a chipping green.  When Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors last month, he agreed to forfeit New York real estate worth about $22 million to the government.  It's a list of resplendent homes, some purchased with ill-gotten gains, prosecutors said.  And one day, they may all be for sale. They might even go cheap.  ""The government, they don't like to wait years for the best price, they want to move it,"" said David B. Smith, a former deputy chief of the Justice Department's asset forfeiture office. ""With a unique property, that may be stupid, but they want to do it."" The United States Marshal's Service will hire local brokers to sell off the properties, proceeds of which will go to Uncle Sam — after, that is, all debts are paid. (Mr. Manafort and his family borrowed heavily against the properties.) It is too soon to know when the properties may come to market because formal forfeiture proceedings have not yet begun.  But here's a sneak peek: Mr. Manafort's daughter, Andrea, using money from her father's holding company, purchased this three-bedroom apartment in 2007 for just over $2.5 million.  The property is attached to New York City's first automated parking garage, where a robotic attendant puts away your car. Apartments there are still a good deal because the building is on the border of Chinatown and Little Italy, said Ari Harkov, a broker with Halstead, who has sold two other units in the building. The price per square foot of comparable apartments in the area, he said, is significantly less than similar apartments just a few blocks north in Soho. Still, Mr. Harkov said some liberal-leaning clients are unwilling to buy apartments linked to Mr. Trump — including 184 Kent in Brooklyn, which is owned by his son-in-law, the developer Jared Kushner. That could affect the price, he said. ""I have had people who will say no to that building because they don't want to line his pockets,"" Mr. Harkov said.  This Soho apartment has a wood-burning fireplace, more than 2,000 square feet of open loft space, a steam shower and a soaking tub — not to mention an elevator that opens directly into the home.  It cost Mr. Manafort $2.85 million in 2012, money funneled through a shell company to hide income from lobbying work on behalf of pro-Russian political factions in Ukraine, according to the indictment.  But wait, there's more. ""The view is ridiculous,"" said Meris Blumstein, a broker with Corcoran.  Though it is only on the fourth floor, the building sits where Crosby Street hits a dead end, giving it an unobstructed view.  ""You're looking north at everything, at the entire city,"" she said.  When Mr. Manafort's family bought this turn-of-the-century townhouse on a wide, tree-trimmed block in Carroll Gardens, it still had all its original glamour, said Lindsay Barton Barrett, a broker at Compass. She sold it to the family for just under $3 million in 2012. There were encrusted mantle pieces, delicate plasterwork and stippled floral wall coverings spread across its more than 4,000 square feet.  It has since undergone extensive renovation, some of which began in October 2017 — just a few days after prosecutors accused Mr. Manafort of misappropriating a $5 million loan for construction to instead buy another property in California.  Ten bedrooms! A tennis court! A little patch of green and a sand trap to practice your putt!  Those amenities, plus its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, make Mr. Manafort's forfeited Long Island mansion a pretty desirable property, said Paul Brennan, Douglas Elliman's executive manager for sales in the Hamptons.  But Mr. Brennan said the estimated $7 million value assigned by real estate websites like Trulia seems high. ""If you want a high price on a tainted guy's house, you are not going to get it,"" Mr. Brennan said.  For example, the house owned by Bernard L. Madoff in nearby Montauk sold for $9.41 million in 2009 after it was seized by the government. Now, it is on the market for more than twice as much, perhaps as its criminal connection has receded with the past. Mr. Manafort used his apartment in the building where his future boss lived, and from which the campaign was run, as a selling point when he pitched himself to Mr. Trump to work on the campaign. Mr. Manafort purchased it in 2006 for $2.6 million.  It's 1,500 square feet on the 43rd floor (or is it the 33rd floor?). Despite the pink marble lobby and plum location, apartments in the tower seem to have lost some of their selling power.  Mr. Manafort told prosecutors that it was worth $6 million during bond negotiations last year. In fact, it had lost a fourth of its value over the past two years, according to the most recent available data from the property site Zillow."

Plain, gray and near a McDonald's, it's part of a generic office complex surrounded by a vast parking lot in a suburb of Copenhagen. ""Danish Tax Agency"" is stenciled in both English and Danish on a glass front door. This outpost of SKAT, as the I.R.S. in Denmark is known, seems an improbable setting for what the authorities call one of the great financial crimes in the country's history. For three years, starting in 2012, so much money gushed from an office here that it was as though the state had sprung a gigantic leak. Prosecutors in Copenhagen say it was an elaborate ruse, one that ultimately cost taxpayers more than $2 billion — a spectacular sum for Denmark, the equivalent of a $110 billion loss in the far larger American economy. The country had fallen victim to a dubious financial maneuver at the intersection of the tax system and capital markets, a dizzyingly complex transaction known as a ""cum-ex"" trade. The trade is focused on one of the dullest, most overlooked acts in any financial system — the request for refunds on taxes withheld on dividends. Under Danish law, the government automatically collects taxes on dividends paid out by companies to their shareholders. If the shareholders live in the United States, they are eligible for a refund on some or all of those taxes. A tiny department in SKAT, run by one man, approved thousands of applications for refunds. Most of the applications were filed by self-directed pension plans in the United States, a type of retirement account for individuals. But experts and lawyers familiar with the scheme say those people were fronts for cum-ex trades. Deploying a kind of financial sleight of hand, the trades made it appear as if the pension plans had purchased shares of Danish companies and paid taxes on the dividends. Neither was true. To the Danes, it was a fraud, one executed and conceived by Sanjay Shah, a 48-year-old, London-born financier. With an assist from employees, he found the Americans, helped facilitate the applications and ended up with much of the money. Mr. Shah denies any wrongdoing and through a publicist says he merely took advantage of a loophole. He now lives in Dubai, where he owns a $1.3 million yacht and a 10,000-square-foot villa with access to the beach. He has become Denmark's national villain. ""You have this guy, living off fraud, it's infuriating,"" said Joachim B. Olsen, a member of the Danish Parliament and chairman of its Finance Committee. ""The expectation of the Danish people is that we will go after him, no matter the cost."" Since May, the cost has included hiring an American law firm to sue 277 of the self-directed pension plans and their owners who applied for all those tax refunds. But the true toll of this scandal can't be measured in kroner. It has undermined trust in Danish politics and it has severely dented the country's self-image as a bastion of honest, efficient government. An unfolding $230 billion money-laundering fiasco at Danske Bank, the country's largest lender, has only deepened the gloom. What has made the dividend debacle even more painful is that many here believe it was an inside job. The lone employee approving those tax refunds was a lifelong civil servant named Sven Nielsen. After a lengthy investigation, the police learned that Mr. Nielsen had spent a few boozy and convivial evenings with an employee of Mr. Shah's, although they found no evidence that he had colluded or profited in any way. Instead, they discovered evidence that years ago, Mr. Nielsen had helped an old friend bilk SKAT in a relatively small scam. Through his lawyer, Mr. Nielsen declined to comment — from prison, where he is now serving a six-year sentence for criminal fraud in that case. So, Danes are left with a mystery that belongs in a Nordic noir, one with elements of farce and filled with enraging twists. Is Mr. Nielsen a co-conspirator, or a dupe? Is he a criminal or a man so flattered by attention that his critical faculties abandoned him? The other mystery concerns Mr. Shah, who is now rebranding himself as a philanthropist, raising money for autism research by promoting concerts with performers like Flo Rida and Lenny Kravitz. He has been formally termed a suspect by Danish authorities, but to the collective amazement of the Danes no criminal charges have been filed against him. A spokesman for the State Prosecutor for Serious Economic and International Crime would not say why. Instead, with impeccable Scandinavian restraint he said only that the case involves people ""who seem to have used a very crafty setup."" Mr. Shah declined to be interviewed for this article. To offer his version of events, he provided through his publicist a 14-page handwritten letter that outlined his career. And for added personal details, there is a series of autobiographical videos that he posted two years ago on YouTube, titled ""I Am Sanjay Shah."" In each, he sits in a spacious living room in a house in Dubai and muses about his life and business philosophy, omitting any hint of controversy. He comes across as an upbeat, middle-aged expat with an abiding fondness for music. After a midlife crisis, he founded Autism Rocks and became a part-time concert promoter, at one point booking his personal favorite, Prince. Mr. Shah also has a taste for the extravagant. In one video, he said that sports cars parked outside the office at Merrill Lynch, where he worked early on, inspired him to consider a new career. ""I said to my boss, 'Who drives these cars?'"" he recalled in the video. ""And he said the traders do on the fifth floor. So then I decided that I wanted to be one of those people."" Mr. Shah was raised in London by parents of Indian ancestry who had immigrated from Kenya. He dropped out of college in 1992, citing a lack of motivation, and worked at a number of large financial firms. In 2007, he landed a job at the London office of Rabobank, a Dutch company, on the dividend arbitrage desk. There he learned about cum-ex trades. The term is Latin for ""with-without"" and refers to the status of shares before and after a dividend is issued. Cum-ex trades would quickly become the focus of Mr. Shah's professional life. Around the time of the global financial crisis, Rabobank closed its dividend arbitrage desk. While former colleagues scrambled to look for careers in other fields, Mr. Shah boldly opened his own firm, Solo Capital, with an office of eight employees. At the same time, he did something unusual for a man starting a business in London. He and his family moved to Dubai, ""mainly for the weather and the lifestyle,"" he explained in a video. As economies around the globe reeled, Mr. Shah found himself in one of the few growth segments in banking. Cum-ex trades are made possible by tax treaties between countries, agreements that are intended to prevent double taxation. Denmark has such a treaty with the United States. What government regulators throughout Europe failed to foresee was that foreign dividend tax refunds could yield immense and dubious profits. After the financial meltdown, dozens of German banks desperate for a new source of profits eagerly facilitated cum-ex trades, fueled by capital from all over the world. Traders made off with more than $11 billion, according to officials there. Cum-ex would reap fortunes from the governments in Austria, Belgium and Switzerland, too. It took years for the German authorities, who banned the practice in 2012, to figure out what had hit them. The first cum-ex indictments in the country were filed in May. ""It turned out to be one of the biggest financial scandals that Europe has ever seen,"" said Bastian Finkel, a tax lawyer at BLD, a law firm in Cologne, ""and all the more painful because it's public money."" In the wake of their losses, the authorities in Germany didn't bother to alert other countries, and speculators moved elsewhere. The biggest target, it turned out, was Denmark. Under the terms of an American-Danish tax agreement, Americans who own shares in, for instance, Carlsberg can get a full or partial refund on the 27 percent withheld for tax on dividends. Retirement accounts get the best deal of all. They get all 27 percent of the tax back. To scale up his cum-ex trade, Mr. Shah needed individuals in the United States with self-directed pension plans, a type of retirement account that allows owners to invest in a wide range of financial instruments. By 2012, he had found more than a dozen of them — which turned out to be plenty. The names of these Americans who owned the self-directed pension plans became public this summer, when Danish authorities sued them, hoping to recover lost funds. Exactly how these people linked up with Solo Capital is unknown. Mr. Shah's publicist would say only that they came via wealth management advisory firms. There are demographic patterns. Most live on the East Coast, with clusters in New York, New Jersey and Florida. At least five different plans used the same mailing address, 425 West 23rd Street, Apartment 7B, New York, N.Y. The current tenant there had never heard of the Danish lawsuits, but said he had received mail for one of the defendants, Gavin Crescenzo, a previous occupant. Nearly all the defendants have jobs in finance, though one, Michael Ben-Jacob, is a partner at a prestigious law firm, Arnold & Porter. He declined to discuss the case and a spokeswoman at the firm said it did not comment on litigation in progress. Many people have their names attached to dozens of pension plans, which is why there are 277 suits and roughly 17 defendants. A 30-year-old named Roger Lehman, for instance, opened 44 plans in a handful of states, with names such as the Ludlow Holdings 401K Plan and the Hotel Fromance Pension Plan. Mr. Shah said through his spokesman that Solo Capital worked with 200 of these pension plans. He declined to identify which ones. None of the defendants responded to requests for comment. In July, though, an email response came instead, unbidden, from a law firm in Luxembourg called Schaffelhuber Müller & Kollegen. A partner there named Helene Schwiering stated that her clients, whom she did not name, would appreciate it ""if you henceforth refrain from attempting to contact them."" On paper, the owners of the plans pocketed most of SKAT's $2 billion. In reality, these people probably wound up with little or none of the money. That, at least, is the impression of John Hanamirian, a plaintiffs attorney in New Jersey. Until mid-July, he represented defendants in more than 50 cases, then he suddenly filed legal papers withdrawing from all but a few of them. The withdrawal filings were revealing. They stated that Mr. Hanamirian was not paid by defendants named in the lawsuits. Rather, his bills were paid by what he described only as a ""Luxembourg law firm."" And that law firm would not provide needed files about his defendants, ""despite repeated requests,"" he wrote. In an interview, Mr. Hanamirian elaborated. The firm was the one in Luxembourg that sent that out-of-the-blue email asking that defendants in the cases be left alone. ""I needed documents surrounding their involvement, whatever that is — bank statements, investment statements, communications,"" Mr. Hanamirian said. ""The firm wouldn't do it. They said, 'We'll meet you in advance, the day of the proceedings.' I said that's unacceptable."" Before exiting the cases, Mr. Hanamirian spoke to a handful of clients who told him that money went in and then was immediately moved out of their accounts. Whether the defendants earned a fee of some kind is unknown to Mr. Hanamirian, as is the ultimate destination of the funds. ""I don't want any of this to reflect on my former clients,"" he said. ""But the whole thing was definitely odd."" In 2013, all that stood between Solo Capital and Denmark's treasury was the bespectacled, gray-haired veteran of SKAT, Sven Nielsen. After two colleagues retired, he was the last person in the Dividend Department. Complicating matters, he lacked the tools to perform the most basic due diligence when reviewing refund applications. The agency was in the midst of a yearslong and often disastrous overhaul, meant to digitize the system and reduce head count. The priority was helping Danish taxpayers, not foreign shareholders. Mr. Nielsen didn't even have a database to check whether an individual pension plan actually owned the shares it claimed, said Lisbeth Romer, who was Mr. Nielsen's boss until she retired in 2013. ""Sven's job was reduced to bookkeeping, essentially, checking if a form was filled out properly,"" she said. ""A monkey could do it."" There was another problem that nobody knew about then: Mr. Nielsen could be persuaded to break the law. When the Danish police searched his home after the Solo Capital revelations, they found a letter showing that in 2007, he helped an old friend illegally secure $5.7 million from SKAT. (The two men knew each other from the days when Mr. Nielsen moonlighted with a job delivering newspapers.) Last December, prosecutors convicted Mr. Nielsen of fraud for taking a kickback, the equivalent of $315,000, for his efforts. Defenders of Mr. Nielsen maintain that he is a fundamentally decent guy who made a serious mistake under the suasion of a pal. True or not, Mr. Nielsen had a new pal in 2014, just as the SKAT payouts soared. His name was Camilo Vargas. He worked in London at one of a small number of ""payment agents,"" niche companies that handle the array of paperwork submitted to foreign tax authorities for refunds. Mr. Vargas had just founded his own payment agent firm, which he called Syntax GIS. Soon after Syntax began operations, it started working with Sanjay Shah, who eventually bought the company. During the first of several trips to Copenhagen, Mr. Vargas sought out Mr. Nielsen, asking for guidance on how to fill out Danish tax refund applications. What is known about those meetings comes from the one interview Mr. Nielsen has ever given, in a 2016 documentary that ran on DR, Denmark's version of the BBC. Mr. Nielsen appeared to be flattered by the attention and happy to provide advice. He just as gladly accepted invitations to dinner. Mr. Nielsen described in the interview a lively evening drinking beer with Mr. Vargas in a popular downtown area in Copenhagen. ""We walked down Stroget,"" he said, referring to a famous pedestrian street, ""and made several pit stops."" The friendship was fantastically lucrative. In 2014, more than $590 million was paid on 1,500 refund applications. Danish authorities believe most of them came from Solo Capital clients. In the first seven months of 2015, the figures soared to roughly $1.2 billion, paid to more than 2,500 applications — about 16 applications every working day. It apparently never occurred to Mr. Nielsen that Camilo Vargas was playing him. ""At no point did I get the impression that he wanted to trick me or cheat in any way,"" Mr. Nielsen said in the documentary, sounding bereft. ""But that's what it could appear like today."" Mr. Vargas could not be located for comment. The producers at DR hired a researcher to find him, to no avail. In the summer of 2015, the pace of applications made one final surge. In July alone, $500 million in refunds was disbursed — about $25 million per working day, $3 million every hour. Mr. Shah may have had a hunch that the Danish tax refund machine was about to stop working. In May 2015, he met in London with his then-new compliance officer at Solo Capital, Navin Khokhrai. As Mr. Shah put it in the handwritten letter provided by his publicist, Mr. Khokhrai expressed profound reservations about Solo Capital's business, telling his boss that he was unsure ""whether the company was processing the trades correctly."" Mr. Shah assured him that he'd obtained all necessary legal clearances. Mr. Khokhrai was apparently not convinced. He resigned soon after and Mr. Shah stated in the same handwritten letter that his former employee ""submitted a whistle-blower letter to HMRC"" — Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs — ""alleging that Solo had created fictitious client accounts and trading records in order to defraud the tax authorities in Denmark and Belgium."" In August 2015, the dividends stopped flowing out of SKAT, though not because of sirens set off by anyone inside the agency. Rather, it took a tip from the British government to end the scheme, several Danish politicians said. The London offices of Solo Capital were later raided by Britain's National Crime Agency and by July 2016 Solo Capital closed. At the time, Mr. Shah said he had done nothing improper. ""Had they accused a large bank like Goldman Sachs the bank would have kicked back with a large team of lawyers,"" he told Borsen, a Danish newspaper. ""It's easier to target a single individual."" Danish authorities have been trying to unravel Mr. Shah's handiwork for over three years. Much of his modus operandi was revealed, experts believe, in 2017 when police in Germany, who were acting at the behest of the Danes, used a search warrant to sift through the records of North Channel Bank, a small bank in Mainz, a city outside Frankfurt. A team of 60 investigators found that the bank was used by 27 of the American pension plans, which were ultimately paid a total of about $168 million by SKAT. What investigators found is that the accounts didn't actually own any shares of Danish companies, said Prof. Christoph Spengel, who served as an adviser to Germany's Parliament during an inquiry into the questionable trades. He studied the results of the North Channel investigation, issued in a report by a German district attorney. He said that the 27 plans primarily traded with one another. One would place an order to short a chunk of shares of Danish stock — essentially, a promise to buy the shares once they dipped below a certain price. Soon after, an order was placed by another of the 27 plans to buy the order for the shorted shares. That open buy order — essentially, a promise to purchase shares that the other plan still didn't own — was proof enough for SKAT to approve a refund. Once the refund was issued, the buy order was canceled. ""This wasn't a transaction, this wasn't tax planning,"" Professor Spengel said. ""This was fraud."" A spokeswoman for North Channel said the bank was cooperating with the authorities and had no comment. After funds were wired to North Bank, Professor Spengel said, they were shunted to two banks, first in London, then another in Germany. Finally, he said, they were sent to accounts controlled by Mr. Shah and his wife, Usha. Jack Irvine, Mr. Shah's spokesman, said none of this was true. ""Neither Solo nor Sanjay have had anything to do with North Channel Bank,"" he wrote in an email, ""so there appears to be confusion, which is not unusual in this case."" There has been outrage in Denmark over the SKAT scandal but so far the repercussions have been surprisingly limited. No ministers have been fired. The director of SKAT was laid off in August 2016, though Mr. Shah's machinations were among several causes. A new investigation into the cum-ex disaster was ordered by the justice minister in February, which could last years. For now, politicians here seem to emphasize pragmatism over finger-pointing. ""In the past, governments have fallen because of investigations like this,"" said Jesper Petersen, a member of the opposition Social Democratic Party. ""But we have yet to find any minister who saw evidence of this problem and ignored it."" Sanjay Shah is preoccupied with his own troubles. In mid-September, a High Court of Justice judge in London entered a $1.3 billion default judgment against Solo Capital and a company it owned, Elysium Global, in a case filed by SKAT alleging fraud. Mr. Shah's spokesman said his client didn't respond to the lawsuit because both companies are now controlled by liquidators. He also said that at the prodding of Danish officials, Britain, Germany and the United Arab Emirates have all frozen, though not confiscated, $660 million in assets belonging to Mr. Shah. The financial pinch is enough that Mr. Shah has been forced to put his house up for sale, the publicist added. Out of caution, the publicist said, Mr. Shah does not travel. Fears of arrest and extradition are justified, said Henning Sorensen, an associate law professor at the University of Southern Denmark. ""Shah is free as long as he stays in Dubai,"" he said. ""He is like a bird living in a golden cage."""
News,2018-10-05,"A few years ago, the gateways to the courtyard of Peter Bracichowicz’s co-op in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, were empty. Now, there are wall-to-wall baby strollers.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/realestate/new-yorks-new-strollervilles.html,1972," A few years ago, the gateways to the courtyard of Peter Bracichowicz's co-op in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, were empty. Now, there are wall-to-wall baby strollers. ""I actually counted them: 10 on one side, eight on the other,"" said Mr. Bracichowicz, a Corcoran agent who used to live in the complex. ""And that's just in the entrance.""  With its namesake sprawling green space and playgrounds, Sunset Park has always welcomed families. That the census district, which includes nearby Windsor Terrace, had the third highest birthrate in the city last year is more surprising. It joins a list of unassuming neighborhoods, mostly outside of Manhattan, where new and growing families are putting down roots — or at least seeking respite from runaway housing prices in more expensive areas. How long these neighborhoods remain affordable is another matter. Even as most local markets cool, bidding wars are still common in a number of these fast-growing family outposts, and prices are climbing. In some precincts, stroller-fication is already rattling some longtime residents. Borough Park and Kensington in Brooklyn topped the list in 2017, with 11.5 percent of women in the area giving birth that year, according to an analysis of new census data. That district was followed by the Belmont/East Tremont area in the Bronx (9 percent); Sunset Park, Brooklyn (8.5 percent); Brownsville, Brooklyn (7.7 percent); and Ozone Park, Queens (7.4 percent). For comparison, the citywide birthrate was 4.6 percent.  Some areas, like Borough Park and the Upper West Side, were already well-established family neighborhoods, but most areas that topped the list were relatively new to the stroller set.  The Times compared the share of women who gave birth in 55 census districts, which typically include more than one neighborhood and roughly coincide with the city's 59 community districts. Among the areas with the highest share of births, four were in Brooklyn, three were in the Bronx, two were in Queens and only one — the Upper West Side — was in Manhattan. Compared to 2012, six of the districts were new to the top 10.

Sources: American Community Survey analysis by Social Explorer; real estate data from StreetEasy. | By The New York Times But families planning their next move should beware: Baby booms, like housing bubbles, can go bust. The most fruitful area in 2012, Crown Heights South, Prospect-Lefferts and Wingate, in central Brooklyn, had a 9.5 percent birthrate, the highest in the city. But by 2017, the district had fallen 36 ranks, to a birthrate of 3.7 percent. The drop-off coincided with one of the sharpest price hikes in the city: The median sales price in the area more than doubled, from $420,000 in 2012 to $865,000 in 2017, according to StreetEasy, the real-estate data website. ""The prices have gone crazy, that's what happened,"" said Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College and the president of Social Explorer, a research firm that analyzed the data. As bargain hunters spread farther along mass transit routes, they find comparatively cheaper housing, but push prices higher in the process. Crown Heights is an example of what can happen when word of affordable housing spreads: Prices soar, and the next wave of buyers, including new families, has to look elsewhere.  Affordability is not the only factor that influences the shifting birthrate, Dr. Beveridge said. In Borough Park, for instance, the consistently high birthrate can be partially attributed to the large Hasidic community, whose members tend to have more children. But there is also evidence that families getting priced out of wealthier areas are leading the shift. Martine Langatta, 30, an artist, and her husband, Julian Cavin, 28, were living with family in Park Slope, Brooklyn, before the arrival of their son, Valentine, who is now 10 months old. Mr. Cavin, who was born and raised in the neighborhood, wanted to stay there, but the couple could not afford anything in the area. ""Even though it's such a huge city, there aren't a lot of options,"" said Mr. Cavin, an owner of the Williamsburg branch of the Italian specialty store Regina's Grocery. Their agent, Ugo Russino of Warburg Realty, suggested Sunset Park, about 20 blocks south of where they were living, where homes traded at a fraction of the cost. Last year, they bought a one-bedroom on the park for $400,000; a similar home in Park Slope might have cost $600,000 to $700,000, Mr. Russino said. The neighborhood's diversity, with thriving Hispanic and Chinese communities, was a major draw for the couple, whose morning routine now involves walking past 7 a.m. soccer games and Tai-chi classes in the park. The move to more far-flung neighborhoods also reflects a fundamental question for some: Who needs Manhattan? ""How the city functions and flows, and how it was set up two generations ago, is kind of getting turned on its head,"" said Brad Bateman, an agent with Stribling & Associates, who has noticed an uptick in the number of young families living and also working in Brooklyn. Maria Suarez, 30, and her husband, Franco Salgado, 25, work in Red Hook, near the industrial Brooklyn waterfront, where Ms. Suarez is the production manager at EFS Designs, a textile and screen printing shop. They were renting a one-bedroom apartment nearby for $1,750 a month, but with their first child on the way, they needed more space, Ms. Suarez said, and the limited two-bedroom options they saw were too expensive, too small or both. Now the couple lives in a two-bedroom ground-floor apartment in a Sunset Park brownstone, where they pay $2,200 a month — around $300 a month less than they would have paid for any of the two-bedrooms they saw in Red Hook. They have already scoped out a number of child-friendly perks: rows of nearby markets and mom-and-pop restaurants, a public pool that was packed this summer and friendly neighbors. (Their daughter, Isabella, was born in early October.)  Also, ""a lot of lovely grandmas,"" Ms. Suarez said. ""They're super-sweet and always ask how I am. They seem to know a lot about the kids in the neighborhood."" How long Sunset Park will remain an affordable option for young families priced out of other parts of Brooklyn or Manhattan is unclear. In the past five years, ""prices have basically doubled,"" said Mr. Bracichowicz, the Corcoran agent.  The trend is citywide. In a May study, StreetEasy found that, between 2010 and 2017, the share of two-bedroom apartments listed for less than $1 million fell by more than 50 percent, said Grant Long, the site's senior economist. But that is starting to change, Mr. Long said, as more developers build relatively affordable units, including two-bedrooms, now that the luxury market is softening. Other neighborhoods are just beginning to heat up. The area of Morris Park, Pelham Parkway and Laconia, in the Bronx, had the second-lowest birthrate in the city in 2012, with fewer than 2 percent of women there giving birth. In the 2017 survey, the area's birthrate had jumped to 6.3 percent, the seventh highest in the city. ""Not a day goes by that we don't count our blessings, that we bought when we bought,"" said Brenda Morales, 42, who works in real estate financing. She and her husband, Richard Velez, bought a three-bedroom home in Morris Park in the mid-$500,000s this year. From 2012 to 2017, the median sales price in the area rose to roughly $453,000, up 22 percent, according to StreetEasy.  Ms. Morales, a Bronx native, Mr. Velez and their nine-year-old son, Ian, left a ""cooped-up"" apartment in Co-op City for the suburban feel of Morris Park. She said their new block has a number of families with young children, and she expects the area to get pricier soon: A Metro-North station is being planned nearby, which will make the commute to Manhattan faster. ""There are always people asking me"" for real estate leads, said Dan Scaglione, an owner of Scaglione Brothers' Bakery & Deli and a part-time agent with the Pantiga Group real estate brokerage. He joined the company five years ago, in part because of the surging demand for housing in the area, which has very low turnover. ""I could get five or six calls a day on one sign,"" he said, referring to for-sale signs in the neighborhood. Developers are also paying attention. The Horizon Group is building a 63-unit condo at 264 Webster Avenue, in the Kensington area of Brooklyn, part of the district with the highest birthrate in the city. David Marom, the company's managing partner, said he was drawn to the area by the number of schools and family amenities nearby. In an unusual move, the project revised its plans to build 72 rental units in favor of fewer, larger condos, including several two- and three-bedroom apartments, on the strength of the family market, he said. Prices will start at $325,000 for a studio and $895,000 for a three-bedroom. The project is also expected to qualify for city tax abatements that builders in some more expensive neighborhoods can no longer claim. As a result, buyers could pay as little as $4.55 a month in taxes the first year. Low monthly costs were one of the reasons Sharlene Kemler, 35, bought a two-bedroom co-op in Kensington for $440,000 in 2016. She and her husband, Jordan, pay about $600 a month in maintenance in a recently updated building, whereas monthly fees in Park Slope, at their last home, could be hundreds more. Not to mention that they couldn't compete with buyers there. ""We were getting outbid,"" said Ms. Kemler, a philanthropy consultant who works with charities. ""You're competing with 10 other people, and some are coming in all-cash."" The best part about their new home, she said, is that their one-year-old son, Milo, will grow up with friends that have diverse backgrounds. The area has a mix of East Asian, Uzbeki, Russian and Hispanic residents, among others. Pricier Park Slope, Ms. Kemler said, can feel more homogeneous by comparison.  The push toward more affordable neighborhoods, however, underscores a persistent housing problem: Incoming bargain hunters are raising the prices for longtime residents. Brownsville, in Brooklyn, for instance, was part of the district that had the fourth highest share of births in 2017, a large jump from 2012, when it came in 20th place. But it is also one of the poorest areas on the list. The median household income there last year was less than $20,300. ""It's like gentrification refugees,"" said Gerard D. Miller Jr., a housing counselor with Brooklyn Neighborhood Services, a nonprofit group. ""East New York is rapidly developing. Canarsie is up. Now Brownsville is the last-ditch effort for affordability."" Gaylene Durrant, 43, was getting priced out of her two-bedroom apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where she had lived for years with her two sons. Two years ago, she qualified for a below-market-rate apartment in a new complex in Brownsville. The five-building complex, called Prospect Plaza, was developed by Oceanhill LLC, in collaboration with the nonprofit NYC Housing Partnership and with funding from the city, and it was entirely reserved for residents making less than 60 percent of the New York area's median income. Two-bedrooms, for example, were designated for families making about $30,000 to $42,000 a year. More than 100,000 applications were submitted for 394 units, said Gale D. Kaufman, of Duvernay + Brooks, one of the developers.  Ms. Durrant, who works in retail services, now pays about $900 a month, after additional subsidies, for a two-bedroom apartment in one of the buildings. She has since revisited her old apartment in Bed-Stuy, where the landlord did major work after she moved out and increased the rent significantly. ""You wouldn't believe how nice it is now,"" she said.  It is not just the housing that has gotten more expensive in her old neighborhood, she said, but also the services: Her local grocery was recently renovated, and when it reopened the prices were noticeably higher. Sometimes she wonders where she would have gone if she had not entered the affordable housing lottery. ""If push came to shove, I probably might have moved to Florida,"" she said.

News,2018-10-05,"WRIGHTSVILLE, Pa. — Standing inside his cluttered garage workshop, Michael Crumling, a 29-year-old gunsmith, proudly showed off an impressive collection of lead bullets he has meticulously crafted from scratch. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/us/3d-printed-guns-homemade-ammunition.html,1540," WRIGHTSVILLE, Pa. — Standing inside his cluttered garage workshop, Michael Crumling, a 29-year-old gunsmith, proudly showed off an impressive collection of lead bullets he has meticulously crafted from scratch.  Across the country, millions of weapons aficionados like Mr. Crumling reload their own ammunition and cast their own bullets — time-consuming hobbies that have been a part of firearms culture for generations. But Mr. Crumling has also created something else in his garage that distinguishes him from his peers, a potential solution to a problem that has long vexed creators of 3-D printed guns: a bullet that wouldn't ruin the plastic firearms. And yet Mr. Crumling says he has no plans to sell or mass produce the designer round, despite it representing the next step in making printable guns more reliable, and the next front in an ongoing regulatory fight over homemade weaponry. ""I don't see the point,"" he said recently, explaining that despite the allure of 3-D guns and ammunition, people who want to build their own firearms can do much better with off-the-shelf parts from their local hardware stores — or eBay, which he turned to when constructing a submachine gun with metal he filed and bent himself. Amid a national debate over tighter access to guns, and legislative efforts to regulate the unfettered sale of bullets and shells, interest in this pastime has been bolstered by a lively online D.I.Y. community that trades in how-to YouTube videos and engages in passionate web forum discussions about best practices and likely legal challenges. As fervid as D.I.Y. gunsmiths are, an equally passionate online community has emerged around homemade ammunition. About five million out of roughly 43 million hunters and sport shooters in the United States make their own bullets and shells, according to reloading companies. These D.I.Y. hobbyists consist primarily of two groups: Reloaders who take spent shell casings that are left behind after a weapon, usually a semiautomatic, is fired, and make them usable again by carefully refilling them with gunpowder and coupling that with a new primer and a bullet. And home casters who make bullets from scratch, typically by melting lead they buy online or get from junkyards, auto body shops or gun ranges. [Read: California Tries New Tack on Gun Violence: Ammunition Control] Enthusiasts cite this pursuit as a way to customize ammunition for heightened accuracy or lethality and as a practical skill should bullets be banned or one day be in short supply. ""It gives me time to think,"" said Gavin Gear, who runs a popular blog and YouTube channel called Ultimate Reloader, which offers instructional videos and reviews of reloading equipment. He described the process as a relaxing ritual: ""Not unlike a blacksmith making a knife or a samurai sword."" But mostly, it comes down to saving money: Many people who cast bullets at home cited the price of ammunition, which, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has steadily climbed over the past several decades and hit its highest price this year. David Reiss, who has been casting his own bullets for more than 10 years, said that a box of 50 factory-made cartridges for a .38 special costs about $15, whereas he can reload the same number for roughly $4 in materials. Some types of ammunition, such as .44 Magnum cartridges, can cost more than 50 cents per round. Typical target shooters might use more than 150 rounds at each range visit, while competitive shooters can use over 1,000 rounds every week. Most bullets are made of lead, and obtaining this metal isn't always easy. There are car tires that have internal lead weights meant to stabilize the vehicles, and bullet casters customarily turned to their local mechanics to get cheap or free lead. But this source began drying up after 2009 when, because of pollution concerns, the Environmental Protection Agency and a coalition of automakers, tire manufacturers and retailers launched a campaign to phase out the use of the metal for wheel weights. According to the E.P.A., every year more than one million pounds of lead end up in the woods or waterways near roads when the weights fall off vehicles after they hit potholes or are involved in collisions. At least nine states have banned lead wheel weights. Mr. Reiss, who also oversees membership for a bullet casters association, said that most of his members find lead online or by collecting fired bullets at gun ranges. Some scrap yards still sell lead for about 75 cents a pound. Gunpowder is much easier to obtain. It sells for about $25 a pound, is readily available online or at sporting goods stores, and most types require no license, particularly for quantities smaller than 50 pounds. Among avid shooters, the guiding principle is to avoid using guns made, bullets cast or cartridges reloaded by someone else. Faulty handiwork can cause serious injury or ruin a gun if a shoddy bullet jams or if a weapon is defective. Still, despite this stigma, dozens of boutique producers have popped up in the wake of an ammunition shortage that started about 10 years ago, selling these ""remanufactured"" cartridges, as they are called. Douglas Haig, an aerospace engineer from Mesa, Ariz., ran one such business until he was charged with manufacturing the armor-piercing tracer ammunition that one of his customers, Stephen Paddock, used to gun down hundreds of people last year at a Las Vegas country music festival. As with gun enthusiasts more generally, there is a strain of anxiety that runs through the community of D.I.Y. bullet makers and kit-gun aficionados. In online forums, they worry about the threat of big government intrusions, regulatory barriers, market shortages or price hikes that might limit their access to essential supplies like lead or gunpowder. The government wants to ban guns and ""attacking lead manufacturing is one way they have,"" wrote one person in an online forum a few years ago after it was reported that the last raw lead smelting plant in the country was closing. Storing lead is legal and worth doing, the writer added. Vocal gun advocates also worry about being tarred by association with fringe elements, such as those who commit massacres, and the regulatory backlash that often follows in their wake. After several high-profile shootings this year, YouTube announced in March that it would ban how-to videos on making ammunition. And a few months later in June, the search engine Bing said it would no longer allow advertisements for products that ""aid in the reloading process."" There are subtle cultural and demographic differences within the community of homemade weaponry and ammunition. More retro than futurist, more low-tech than high-tech, casters and reloaders tend to be older and often retirees. The average member in the Cast Bullet Association is a 55-year-old man, typically mathematically-inclined tinkerers from professions where they used their hands, such as dentists, mechanics or surgeons, Mr. Reiss said. The members enjoy the engineering know-how and alchemy experimentation involved in a hobby that requires millimeter exactitude, tireless patience, and constant trial and error. In contrast, those interested in creating printable guns are often younger and more internet savvy. Many also describe themselves as crypto-anarchists, like Cody Wilson, a Texas gun advocate who was recently blocked by a federal judge from publishing his schematics for a 3-D gun online. Many have a reputation as proponents of open-source software and admirers of WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden, and of being frustrated by restrictions on speech. [Read: A judge blocks Cody Wilson's attempts to post his blueprints for 3-D guns.] ""How do governments behave if they must one day operate on the assumption that any and every citizen has near instant access to a firearm through the internet?"" a statement on Mr. Wilson's site once asked. ""Let's find out."" In a separate case, Mr. Wilson was arrested last month after being charged with sexually assaulting a minor. Both parts of the community, though, share a staunch skepticism of the government and an ideological individualism that have long been hallmarks of the broader American gun ethos. Not unlike many supporters of President Trump, many in this group think of themselves as social disrupters, questioning the relationship between citizens and their states. In their view, guns are not just a constitutionally protected right, but also a socio-historical symbol whose very purpose is to level the playing field. In the past, law enforcement agencies have tamped down alarm from gun control advocates about emerging 3-D technology by citing the homemade weapons' lack of durability. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, for instance, released a video in 2013 showing one such gun, called the Liberator and made of a weaker type of plastic, exploding during its test firing. But these reassurances have come less frequently as the stability of the guns have improved and inventions like Mr. Crumling's have become more available. In fact, if 3-D printed guns continue to advance and developers indeed solve the ammunition problem, Mr. Crumling said, the market may eventually move toward fully disposable weapons. Not unlike the pepper spray that people buy and keep in their glove boxes or purses, printed weapons could be thrown away after a single use or several uses, he predicted. ""In this scenario,"" Mr. Crumling said, ""I could see the ammunition becoming the restricted item as opposed to the gun."" Susan C. Beachy in New York and Kitty Bennett in St. Petersburg, Fla., contributed research."
News,2018-10-05,"In the midst of a global reckoning over sexual violence, a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by the Islamic State and a Congolese gynecological surgeon were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for their campaigns to end the use of mass rape as a weapon of war.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/world/nobel-peace-prize.html,1482," In the midst of a global reckoning over sexual violence, a woman who was forced into sexual slavery by the Islamic State and a Congolese gynecological surgeon were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for their campaigns to end the use of mass rape as a weapon of war. The award went to Nadia Murad, 25, who became the voice and face of women who survived sexual violence by the Islamic State, and to Dr. Denis Mukwege, 63, who has treated thousands of women in a country once called the rape capital of the world. They have worked through grave risks to their own lives to help survivors and to bring their stories to the world. Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chairwoman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said, ""We want to send out a message of awareness that women, who constitute half of the population in most communities, actually are used as a weapon of war, and that they need protection and that the perpetrators have to be prosecuted and held responsible for their actions."" In a year when women have turned the world's attention to an epidemic of sexual abuse in the home and in the workplace, the award cast a spotlight on two global regions where women have paid a devastating price for years of armed conflict and was a rebuke to what Ms. Reiss-Andersen described as the failure of the global community to prosecute perpetrators of wartime sexual violence. [Read about the struggles of Dr. Mukwege and Ms. Murad, in their own words.] When the Islamic State overran her homeland in northern Iraq in 2014, Ms. Murad was abducted alongside thousands of other women and girls from the Yazidi minority, the group singled out for rape by ISIS. Whereas the majority of women who escaped refused to be named, Ms. Murad insisted that she be identified and photographed, and her advocacy helped to persuade the United States State Department to recognize the genocide of her people at the hands of the terrorist group. Dr. Mukwege's work, meanwhile, has been centered on a conflict half a world away in one of the most traumatized places on the planet, where villagers have fallen prey to militias, bandits, government soldiers and foreign armies: the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. We unearthed thousands of internal documents that help explain how the Islamic State stayed in power so long. In a bare hospital in the hills above Bukavu, where for years there was little electricity or enough anesthetic, he performed surgery on countless women and campaigned relentlessly to bring attention to their plight. On Friday, from his hospital in Bukavu, Dr. Mukwege told reporters: ""This Nobel Prize reflects the recognition of suffering and the lack of a just reparation for women victims of rape and sexual violence in all countries of the world and on all continents."" He dedicated his prize to ""women of all countries bruised by conflict and facing everyday violence."" In a statement, Ms. Murad congratulated Dr. Mukwege and said she was ""incredibly honored and humbled."" She said she shared the award ""with Yazidis, Iraqis, Kurds, other persecuted minorities and all of the countless victims of sexual violence around the world."" Using the Arabic acronym for ISIS, she added: ""I think of my mother, who was murdered by Daesh, the children with whom I grew up, and what we must do to honor them. Persecution of minorities must end."" Born and raised in the village of Kojo in northern Iraq, Ms. Murad, along with her family, was at the center of ISIS' campaign of ethnic cleansing. Kojo, on the southern flank of Mount Sinjar, was one of the first Yazidi villages to be overrun by ISIS, which launched its attack from the south on Aug. 3, 2014. Residents were herded into Kojo's only school, where women and girls were separated from the men. The male captives, including six of Ms. Murad's brothers, were loaded into trucks, driven to a field outside the town and executed. The women and girls were forced into buses. Ms. Murad was taken to a slave market, where she was sold to an ISIS judge. While the wives of ISIS members were ordered to wear full-covering face veils and gloves, Ms. Murad was forced to wear makeup and suggestive dresses with spaghetti straps. At night, the militant forced himself upon her, viciously beating her if she dared to close her eyes during the assault, she recounted. He warned her that even worse things would happen if she tried to escape. When he caught her jumping out of a window, he ordered her to undress. Then he sent in his bodyguards, who took turns raping her until she passed out. ""At some point, there was rape and nothing else. This becomes your normal day,"" Ms. Murad wrote in her autobiography, ""The Last Girl."" ""You don't know who will open the door next to attack you, just that it will happen and that tomorrow might be worse."" [Read our review of ""The Last Girl.""] She continued, ""There is only rape and the numbness that comes with accepting that this is now your life."" But she eventually escaped. For years afterward, she refused to wear makeup. She embarked on a worldwide campaign, speaking before the United Nations Security Council, the United States House of Representatives, the House of Commons in Britain and other global bodies. Whereas other Yazidi survivors testified before the same bodies with a blanket covering them so that TV cameras would not capture their images, Ms. Murad broke with the norms of her honor-based society and insisted on showing her face. In Yazidi villages in her former homeland, she has become an icon. Many carry her image on their cellphones, and posters of Ms. Murad adorn telephone poles. Ms. Murad has said that she was exhausted by having to repeatedly speak out, but she said she knew that other Yazidi women were being raped back home: ""I will go back to my life when women in captivity go back to their lives, when my community has a place, when I see people accountable for their crimes."" She became the second-youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize after the activist Malala Yousafzai, who was honored in 2014 after surviving a shooting by the Taliban. In 2016, Ms. Murad was named the United Nations' first good-will ambassador for the Dignity of Survivors of Human Trafficking. That same year, she was awarded the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize. In August this year, she announced she was engaged to a fellow Yazidi activist. A documentary to be released this month, ""On Her Shoulders,"" follows Ms. Murad as she travels the world to enlist global leaders in her fight. In her autobiography, Ms. Murad writes: ""I want to be the last girl in the world with a story like mine."" In Congo, the injuries Dr. Mukwege has treated are ghastly: women who have had assault rifles stuck inside them; others pierced with chunks of wood; some victims collapsing on the hospital steps with deep rope burns on their necks from where they had been lashed to trees. Dr. Mukwege has also treated 2-year-olds and women in their 70s. ""It's not a women question; it's a humanity question, and men have to take responsibility to end it,"" Dr. Mukwege once said in an interview. ""It's not an Africa problem. In Bosnia, Syria, Liberia, Colombia, you have the same thing."" In 2012, Dr. Mukwege delivered a fiery speech at the United Nations, upbraiding the Congolese government and other nations for not doing enough to stop what he called ""an unjust war that has used violence against women and rape as a strategy of war."" His advocacy nearly cost him his life. Shortly after the speech, when he returned to Congo, four armed men crept into his compound in Bukavu. They took his children hostage and waited for him to return from work. In the hail of bullets that followed, his guard was killed, but Dr. Mukwege threw himself on the ground and somehow survived. He spent more than two months in exile, but decided that he had to return. ""To treat women for the first time, second time, and now I'm treating the children born after rape,"" Dr. Mukwege said. ""This is not acceptable."" When he returned, he received a hero's welcome. Banners flew across town with messages like ""Welcome our Superman."" To the people in the crowd, Dr. Mukwege urged hope and forgiveness. Though he has criticized the Congolese government for acts of sexual violence by its troops, the government congratulated him on Friday for the prize, even while chiding him for politicizing his work. In awarding the activists, the Norwegian Nobel Committee bypassed an unlikely trio of leaders who had been the favorites among bookmakers around the world: President Trump, Kim Jong-un of North Korea and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. They have taken on the herculean task of trying to denuclearize the divided Korean Peninsula, achieving a shaky détente. "

Here's what you need to know: After weeks of anguished discussion, a pivotal vote this morning is likely to determine whether Judge Kavanaugh sits on the Supreme Court. Republicans and Democrats clashed over the F.B.I.'s report into sexual assault allegations against the judge, and four senators have remained publicly undecided. If the Senate votes in favor of Judge Kavanaugh, a final confirmation could come as early as Saturday. • ""I said a few things I should not have said"": The judge defended his temperament and impartiality after his angry testimony last week, writing in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that he ""might have been too emotional at times."" • Another dissenting voice: A former Supreme Court justice, John Paul Stevens, 98, said Judge Kavanaugh's testimony had shown him to be unfit to sit on the court. Conservative leaders hope anger about liberal opposition to Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination will propel their voters to the polls on Nov. 6. But they also worry that passions will subside if he's confirmed. If you're feeling lost, you're not alone. Nearly half of Americans on both sides of the political spectrum feel like strangers in their own country, according to results from polling by The Times. • Abroad in America: U.S. politics are confusing enough for Americans, let alone for international readers.

More than 300,000 immigrants can continue to live and work legally in the U.S. after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration's move to end special protections for people who fled war or natural disasters in El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan. Many, the judge said, would otherwise have had to choose between taking their American-born children away from the U.S. and splitting their families. But they remain in legal limbo. The administration is likely to appeal the decision. • ""I feel like an American person"":  We spoke to immigrants across the country about their reactions to the ruling and their hopes. This Sunday marks the 17-year anniversary of the start of the war in Afghanistan. Nearly two decades into the conflict, the United States and its allies have turned their attention to training, advising and assisting local forces. A key element is trying to bolster the ranks of female cadets, efforts that often chafe against cultural perceptions of women's place in Afghan society. • A view from the front: Sophia Jones, an Istanbul-based journalist, spent the summer embedded with NATO forces and found that female recruits faced intense challenges, including scorn, death threats and sexual assault. Here's her compelling report. The 2018 prize was awarded to Denis Mukwege, a Congolese doctor who has treated thousands of sexual assault victims, and Nadia Murad, who spoke out about what she endured as a Yazidi forced into sexual slavery by the Islamic State, for ""their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict,"" the Nobel committee said.

News,2018-10-06,Anyone who has been closely watching the Trump administration’s strategy for remaking global trade might have reasonably believed at times that it had no strategy for remaking global trade. ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/upshot/trump-trade-strategy-coming-into-focus.html,1181," Anyone who has been closely watching the Trump administration's strategy for remaking global trade might have reasonably believed at times that it had no strategy for remaking global trade.  But that has changed in recent weeks, with a more coherent approach starting to become apparent — though not one with any guarantee of success. The strategy that has jelled goes something like this: The president has been beating up on traditional allies, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. He has been assailing them publicly, placing tariffs on their steel and aluminum, and threatening to tax their automobiles. But fundamentally, that was just about softening them up to extract moderate concessions favorable to American interests. That has now been achieved with a trade deal with South Korea in late September and a new Nafta, now to be called U.S.M.C.A. (for United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), struck last weekend.  Now that the administration has shown it can get to yes with those deals, similarly patterned agreements with Europe and Japan are expected to come next. After revised deals with those allies are in place, the administration will most likely seek a concerted effort among them to isolate China and compel major changes to Chinese business and trade practices.  The ultimate goal, in other words, is to reset the economic relationship between China and the rest of the world. It may take time and cause pain in the interim. But the idea is it's a multistep process to attain more leverage with which to force China to allow American companies to sell their goods and operate freely, without having their technology stolen. And it bolsters the United States in a geopolitical rivalry with China that is becoming more tense, as Vice President Pence articulated in a speech last week. One telling piece of evidence for this strategy: a provision in the new North American deal that will make it hard for Mexico or Canada to negotiate a trade deal with a ""nonmarket"" economy like China without risking their favored access to the United States' huge market. Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, outlined this strategy at the Economic Club of Washington on Thursday. ""China is first and foremost,"" he said at one point. ""There's a lot of unfair trading practices, and the biggest culprit is China,"" he said. The administration was able to complete the new North American deal, he said, with ""a combination of pressure and negotiations."" ""We are talking to the European Union again, we are talking to Japan again, and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China,"" Mr. Kudlow said. (He didn't note that he'd borrowed a term also used for the allies that joined in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which President Trump has called a disaster.) The sense among analysts that the administration has been pursuing a single coherent strategy contrasts with earlier in the year. At that point, from the outside at least, the administration seemed to be changing its approach by the week, and sometimes by the day. It has often seemed that there has been a series of improvised moves, with different senior officials favoring different approaches. Steel and aluminum tariffs were to be applied to all imports, then close allies were exempted, until two months later when they weren't. There seemed to be a deal to increase Chinese imports of American agricultural and energy products, achieving trade peace — which crumbled days later, as President Trump changed course and demanded more profound changes in the Chinese economy and trade practices. Now, with the new North American deal, it's become easier to see how the different elements of Trump trade fit together. The ""nonmarket"" provision seems devised to give the United States veto power over any deal Canada or Mexico might seek with China. But just because there is a more coherent strategy in the administration's stance toward global trade than in the recent past doesn't mean it will work. And there are still plenty of reasons for skepticism. ""I do think we can see a strategy, but that doesn't mean it's a good strategy,"" said Mary E. Lovely, a professor at Syracuse University and a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""They're going to use these bilateral deals to strong-arm countries into lining up behind the U.S. on China. But when we get there, what's the next step? I don't know what the endgame is."" Some items on the Trump administration's list of demands in negotiations with the Chinese seem unlikely to be met, as they would compel China to abandon its entire strategy to modernize its economy. For example, one demand is for China to halt its subsidies for its ""Made in China 2025"" program aimed at giving its companies a foothold in aircraft, robotics and other areas of advanced manufacturing. There's a risk that even if the effort to isolate China succeeds, the result might be simply a bifurcated world trade system in which there is one orbit of countries with close ties to the United States, and another tied to China, with minimal overlap. A crucial question is whether the administration's strategy of pummeling allies with attacks, threats and tariffs can yield not just revised trade agreements, but also the trust needed to undertake a concerted campaign against China. Ms. Lovely jokes that it would really be the ""coalition of the coerced"" rather than Mr. Kudlow's ""coalition of the willing."" The scars and bruises from negotiations this year could linger, compounded by the Trump administration's disinclination to engage in multilateral negotiations with many parties at once. The new North American deal, a case study in such unwillingness, shares many elements with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was negotiated by the Obama administration and abandoned by the Trump administration in early 2017. The whole agreement was intended as a strategic counterweight to Chinese economic power in the Pacific Rim. But rather than reopen the T.P.P., the Trump administration chose the path of separate deals with each country. The bet is that the United States will have greater negotiating leverage in a series of bilateral deals with allies than it would in some large multicountry agreement — even if many of the details of agreements end up looking similar, as was the case with the new U.S.M.C.A. The risk of that approach is that when the United States hammers out each deal separately, it may be hard to then turn around and create any kind of unified pressure against China. ""To go into battle, together, you need to know that a partner is reliable, that if they tell you something, they'll stick to it,"" said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ""This administration has been anything but reliable on trade policy."" Still, a few things are apparent now that were not at all clear at the beginning of the summer. The Trump administration isn't just looking to blow things up; so long as negotiators can claim victory for American interests, there are deals to be had for allies. And unpleasant as trade skirmishes with Europe or Canada or Japan may be, they're really a warm-up for a trade war with China."
News,2018-10-06,"WASHINGTON — Even as President Trump boasts that he has “eliminated the core of Obamacare,” his health secretary is taking credit for making the law work better than ever.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/us/politics/obamacare-trump-fact-check.html,1686," WASHINGTON — Even as President Trump boasts that he has ""eliminated the core of Obamacare,"" his health secretary is taking credit for making the law work better than ever. What gives? Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, says the president's actions tell the real story. Mr. Trump took decisive steps ""to stabilize insurance markets and expand choices for American consumers,"" Mr. Azar said in a recent speech in Nashville. ""The president who was supposedly trying to sabotage the Affordable Care Act has proven better at managing it than the president who wrote the law."" The administration is making these claims as polls show that Democratic candidates for Congress are having some success in attacking Republicans' record on health care. Open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act starts on Nov. 1. Voters go to the polls five days later. A review of the administration's assertions suggests that some are valid while others are sheer hooey. ""This year alone we have successfully lowered your health insurance premiums in the state of Tennessee by 26 percent,"" Mr. Trump said at a rally in Johnson City, Tenn., this past week. ""For the very first time under the Affordable Care Act, the premium for a benchmark federal exchange plan is projected to actually drop,"" said Mr. Azar, who is in charge of the federal insurance marketplace. This requires context. Insurance markets stabilized after Mr. Trump tried to upend them. That does not necessarily mean that they are more stable because of his policies. Insurers in some states, including Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee and Texas, have said they intend to charge lower rates in 2019. Price increases this year were exceptionally large because insurers developed the rates in the spring of 2017 in a sea of uncertainty: Republicans in Congress were determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and no one could be sure what might replace it. Mr. Trump cut off a crucial source of income for insurers — ""cost-sharing"" subsidy payments — in October 2017, just as state officials were approving final rates for 2018. Mr. Trump does not sound like a man trying to stabilize the Affordable Care Act marketplace. He boasted on Thursday that he had ""mostly obliterated Obamacare."" He said in June that he had ""essentially gutted"" the law. In July last year, he said his strategy was to ""let Obamacare implode."" In October last year, he declared: ""Obamacare is finished. It's dead. It's gone."" A major reason for the moderation in prices is that ""insurers overshot with their premium increases in the last couple of years,"" said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. In other words, insurers, who underestimated their costs and often lost money in the first years under the Affordable Care Act, made corrections — and, in some cases, may have overcorrected — in the last year or two. ""Revenues caught up with the underlying risk of the population,"" said Kurt J. Wrobel, the chief actuary of the Geisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania. ""With more experience, we can better estimate the expected cost of health claims."" Charles Gaba, a health care analyst who meticulously tracks rate changes, said that unsubsidized premiums would rise about 3 percent on average next year, compared with increases averaging about 27 percent this year. Actions by the administration, he said, were responsible for at least half of the increase this year. Insurers built a cushion into this year's rates to allow for political, legislative and regulatory uncertainty. But ""the uncertainty has decreased,"" said Julie Mix McPeak, the Tennessee insurance commissioner, who is president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The outlook for 2019 is clearer. Consumers will no longer be penalized for going without insurance. But tax credits will still be available to reduce premiums for those with low or moderate incomes. __________________ ""Working families are paying the price for Republicans' relentless effort to sabotage their health care and drive up insurance premiums,"" the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, said on Friday. Representative Gene Green, Democrat of Texas, said Republicans had ""taken every action possible to undermine and sabotage the Affordable Care Act."" And Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said, ""Every act of sabotage has contributed to soaring health care premiums, fewer choices for consumers, and millions of Americans losing their coverage under this president's watch."" The reality is more complex. The administration has sent mixed signals. The White House, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department appear to have their own priorities. ""This administration is not monolithic,"" said Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at Families USA, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group. ""Different people have different perspectives and goals."" As an example of sabotage, critics cite the administration's refusal to defend crucial provisions of the Affordable Care Act that protect consumers with pre-existing medical conditions. The administration told a federal court in June that these provisions should be invalidated because they were part of an unconstitutional scheme that required most Americans to carry health insurance. In August, a coalition of four cities — Columbus, Ohio; Baltimore; Cincinnati; and Chicago — filed a lawsuit accusing the president of violating his duty under the Constitution to ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed."" They noted that the administration had slashed funds for groups that help people sign up for insurance; worked with Congress to repeal the individual mandate; and issued new rules to encourage the sale of health plans that do not provide the consumer protections and benefits required by the 2010 health law. But the Affordable Care Act is proving to be resilient. Mr. Trump's actions have not led to the collapse of the law, which his critics feared and he hoped for. Insurance exchanges have not imploded. And federal officials have occasionally defended the law. The administration rejected Idaho's plan to allow the sale of stripped-down, low-cost health insurance that violates the Affordable Care Act. And the administration has given its blessing to a rate-setting technique that protects consumers with low or moderate incomes from steep increases in premiums, at least through 2019. __________________ ""President Trump has approved a number of state reinsurance plans, an efficient solution that helps states pay for the sickest patients, allowing insurers to keep premiums lower,"" Mr. Azar said. He is right. The Trump administration has granted waivers to at least seven states allowing them to set up programs that help pay the largest claims with a combination of state and federal funds. These programs are known as reinsurance — insurance for insurers — and officials in Alaska and Minnesota say they have been highly effective. In Maryland, insurers initially requested rate increases averaging 30 percent for 2019. They amended their requests to reflect the impact of a state reinsurance program approved in August by the Trump administration. As a result, rates will fall next year by an average of 13 percent. ""For the first time since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, individual insurance rates in Maryland will go down instead of up,"" said Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican. __________________ ""When a court struck down an Obama administration regulation regarding another type of payment to insurers,"" Mr. Azar said, ""it was President Trump who issued an emergency regulation to fill the void."" This is a stretch. Mr. Azar was referring to the risk adjustment program, which aims to stabilize insurance markets by redistributing money from health plans with healthier customers to those that enroll sicker people. In February, a federal judge in New Mexico struck down an Obama administration rule after finding that the formula used to calculate the payments was flawed. The Trump administration announced on July 7 that it would stop making the risk adjustment payments. Insurers, consumer groups and members of Congress from both parties protested, saying the action would drive up premiums and cause chaos in insurance markets. The Trump administration backtracked and issued a new regulation to resume the payments using the same formula. ""The new rule is virtually the same as the old rule,"" said Dr. Martin E. Hickey, the founder of New Mexico Health Connections, a nonprofit insurer that successfully challenged the first rule and has filed a lawsuit challenging the new rule. So it is a stretch for Mr. Azar to boast that the Trump administration is filling the void. __________________ ""I will always fight for and always protect patients with pre-existing conditions,"" Mr. Trump said at a rally in West Virginia on Sept. 29. ""On pre-existing conditions,"" he said two days later in Tennessee, ""a lot of people think it's not a very Republican thing. It is now, and it has been for me. I want to take care of people with pre-existing conditions."" And a crowd in Mississippi applauded on Tuesday when the president declared, ""Pre-existing conditions will always be taken care of by us."" These statements are misleading. Mr. Trump spent much of last year trying to persuade Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the main source of protections for people with pre-existing conditions. He supported numerous Republican proposals that would have rolled back or weakened the protections. He celebrated when the House passed a bill allowing states to obtain waivers from federal insurance standards. Under such waivers, the Congressional Budget Office said, people with pre-existing conditions could have faced ""extremely high premiums."" In June, the administration joined an attack on the Affordable Care Act by 20 states and urged a federal court in Texas to throw out popular provisions of the law that protect sick people from being denied insurance or charged higher rates. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Justice Department was taking this position ""with the approval of the president."" With a new rule issued in August, Mr. Trump has also opened the door to the sale of many more short-term insurance plans that explicitly exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions. ""A pregnancy existing on the effective date of coverage will also be considered a pre-existing condition,"" say brochures for short-term plans offered by UnitedHealth and other companies."
News,2018-10-06,TOKYO — It’s going to be tough to replace 83 years’ worth of grime.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/world/asia/tokyo-fish-market-tsukiji.html,1063," TOKYO — It's going to be tough to replace 83 years' worth of grime. As the fishmongers of Tokyo's famed wholesale seafood market, Tsukiji, opened for their final day at their familiar site on Saturday, they and their customers lamented the end of an era of grunge. ""Dirty is best,"" said Yoshitaka Moria, 38, an owner of a fish shop in the Ota ward of Tokyo, who regularly shops for seafood at Tsukiji and was buying an assortment of tuna, sea bream, oysters and amberjack on Saturday morning. ""It makes this place so vibrant. I know that the fishmongers are working too hard to clean up."" In the waning hours of the market believed to be the world's largest for seafood, the lumpy cobblestone alleys, sprawled across 57 acres, were soaked in bloodied water, and forbidden cigarette butts mingled with fragments of bone and guts. In the coming week, most of Tsukiji's 800-plus stalls, which sell 480 varieties of seafood and 270 types of fruits and vegetables, will be moving out from under an enormous rusted steel-frame canopy to a new location where the city has built a $5.3 billion fully enclosed, air-conditioned facility. ""I feel so depressed,"" said Teruo Watanabe, 78, who has worked as a tuna wholesaler in Tsukiji for 60 years. ""I don't like change."" Aside from a ceremonial clapping chant at the end of the final tuna auction on Saturday, there was little sign that it was anything other than a normal day at the market. Styrofoam crates filled with squid, abalone, mackerel, salmon roe and gaping-mouthed tuna heads were stacked high. Middlemen who have bought and sold here for decades sliced slabs of fish on wooden tables crosshatched with thousands of knife nicks. Workers clad in oversize aprons and rubber waders tossed live flounder onto metal spring scales, shouting out their weights. Honking at hesitant pedestrians, standing drivers wove turret trucks in and out of the aisles. Merchants tabulated invoices on abacuses or calculators that went on sale when Japan's octogenarian emperor was still in his 40s. The Tsukiji market opened in 1935, replacing a fish market in the Nihonbashi District of Tokyo that had been destroyed in an earthquake in 1923. Just over half a mile from the center of Tokyo's glittery Ginza shopping district, Tsukiji has grown to be one of Tokyo's most popular tourist attractions, with visitors lining up for hours to see the daily tuna auction before 6 each morning. The wholesalers sell an average of 1,540 tons of seafood a day and an additional 985 tons of fruits and vegetables. Partly because of concerns about the market's advancing age and deteriorating infrastructure, the Tokyo metropolitan government began discussions nearly two decades ago to move the wholesalers to Toyosu, about a mile and a half away on an island in Tokyo Bay that used to house an old gas factory. After years of construction delays, a move was scheduled for 2016. But shortly after Yuriko Koike was elected governor of Tokyo, she postponed the move after it emerged that contaminants in the groundwater at the new site far exceeded environmental limits. The city hired experts to conduct numerous tests and installed concrete floors and extra water pumps in Toyosu. Over the summer, Ms. Koike announced that the new site was safe and scheduled the move for October. But in the days before Tsukiji's closing on Saturday, rumors flew among the shop owners, who said the government had suppressed evidence of continuing contamination. According to one survey, 80 percent of the business owners are reluctant to move. Mikio Wachi, 73, who has run a tuna wholesaler for 48 years in Tsukiji, has vowed not to move to Toyosu. Instead, he said, he would transfer to another market in Ota ward in Tokyo. Two protest posters hung on the awning above his stall. ""Tsukiji market relocation: absolutely opposed!"" As he scraped fine bits of tuna meat from fragile bones with a tiny wood-handled knife, he said he believed chemicals remained in the groundwater in Toyosu. ""It is as if we were to spray chemicals on the fish before selling it,"" he said. Mr. Wachi's son, Akihiro, 41, said moving to Toyosu would be like opening a fish stall in Chernobyl. ""People won't buy,"" he said. A July survey by The Asahi Shimbun, a left-leaning daily newspaper, found that 40 percent of Tokyo residents did not believe Toyosu was safe enough. Many stall owners expressed fears that they might lose customers in the move, although they cited higher parking fees and more difficult access. Outside the wholesale section of the market, merchants selling nuts, cheese, knives, beer, spices, kitchenware and souvenirs continued to hawk their inventory while packing boxes. Crowds lined up at sushi restaurants for hours, waiting to eat one final meal before the move. Azusa Ushikubo, 45, a recruitment company employee who has been coming to Tsukiji for lunch every Saturday for the past 20 years, decided to get a jump on the closing by coming a day early, on Friday. Still, she waited three hours for lunch at Sushidai, one of the most popular restaurants in the market. On Saturday, some Tokyoites who had never managed to visit Tsukiji before made a pilgrimage for the final day. Yumi Kondo, 46, who works as a clerk in a passport agency, came with her daughter, Miyabi, 18. By 9:30 a.m., they had stood in line for two hours at Nakaya, a sushi restaurant they had found online, and still had at least an hour to go. ""The reviews said it always has long lines,"" said the senior Ms. Kondo. ""We figured it would be worth it."" The Tsukiji wholesale market will be razed in the coming months, and the city plans to build a transit hub for buses to be used during the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. A retail section next door, with sushi restaurants and shops, will remain open for tourists. One of the biggest worries is an estimated 10,000 rats that could be unleashed during the wrecking period and new construction. Reiko Horiuchi, 39, who was visiting the market with her 9-year-old son for the first time on its final day, said it was a shame to tear it down. ""There are not so many places like this left in Tokyo,"" she said. ""Everything else is new. But I don't think new things are necessarily better."""
News,2018-10-06,"SÃO PAULO, Brazil — There has been no lack of drama in the lead-up to Brazil’s presidential election on Sunday. One candidate was jailed, another was stabbed and a week before the voting, women organized nationwide protests against the front-runner.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/world/americas/brazil-president-election-jair-bolsonaro.html,820," SÃO PAULO, Brazil — There has been no lack of drama in the lead-up to Brazil's presidential election on Sunday. One candidate was jailed, another was stabbed and a week before the voting, women organized nationwide protests against the front-runner. The presidential contest, the most splintered and divisive race since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s, has for many Brazilians come down to who is the least bad option. The front-runner by a wide margin is the far-right former army captain, Jair Bolsonaro, according to the polls. A member of Congress since 1991, he was long a marginal figure best known for incendiary comments defending Brazil's military dictatorship and attacking women, gays and blacks. In addition to electing the next president from a field of 13 candidates, voters will also choose 27 governors and more than 1,600 state and federal lawmakers. In Brazil, there are 147.3 million eligible voters, and voting is obligatory. As anger and frustration with entrenched political corruption has grown, Mr. Bolsonaro has presented himself as an anti-establishment maverick who could effectively combat corruption and rein in soaring violence and crime. His main rival, former São Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, entered the race only last month. He was selected to represent the left-wing Workers' Party after the former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was sentenced to prison on corruption charges and barred from running as the party's candidate. Until the courts ruled him out, Mr. da Silva had been leading in the polls. But it appears that the Workers' Party has been unable to transfer Mr. da Silva's broad support among impoverished Brazilians to the less charismatic Mr. Haddad. The crowded field also includes Marina Silva, the daughter of Amazon rubber tappers; Geraldo Alckmin, the pragmatic and market-friendly former governor of São Paulo; and a candidate, Cabo Daciolo, who describes himself as a messenger from heaven. The final polls before Election Day showed Mr. Bolsonaro's lead widening as the evangelical and agribusiness lobbies rallied to his side. But he still appeared likely to fall short of the 50 percent-plus-one needed to avoid a runoff. Surveys project him competing in a second round of voting on Oct. 28 against Mr. Haddad. Still, some analysts think that Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, could defy the projections and emerge victorious on Sunday night despite — or perhaps because of — his lack of support from a major political party and a shoestring budget that relied on social media to build a base. Brazil uses an electronic ballot system and is expected to tally results within a couple of hours after polling stations close in the westernmost state of Acre at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Soaring crime, the worst recession on record and institutionalized political corruption have been the three main issues in the campaign. Despite accomplishing little of note during his seven terms as a lawmaker, Mr. Bolsonaro gained prominence when a massive corruption investigation known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash, engulfed all of Brazil's major political parties. He cultivated an image as an abrasive, but honest politician with a clean record. This was in contrast with the Workers' Party, which has been largely blamed for the vast bribery schemes of the past decade and a half. For many voters, the biggest concern has been violent crime. This past year, Brazil averaged 175 murders a day, surpassing its previous macabre record. Mr. Bolsonaro, who insists that he is the only candidate tough enough to stop criminals, has posed often for photos with his fingers pointed like loaded pistols. With his unfiltered comments and amateur videos on social media, he offered ready solutions for the country's problems: He wants to make it easier for citizens to own guns and for the police to shoot criminals. Critics worry, however, that Mr. Bolsonaro would undermine democratic institutions, and they point to outbursts like a congressional speech in 1993 when he declared, ""I am in favor of dictatorship."" As his standing in the polls has improved, opponents rallied behind the motto #EleNão, or #NotHim, taking to the streets and the internet to encourage voters to elect anyone but Mr. Bolsonaro. Brazil's sputtering economy has also divided voters. Many of the country's poorest people, who benefited from expanded social programs during Mr. da Silva's two terms as president, have embraced his stand-in, Mr. Haddad. The Workers' Party insisted that Mr. Haddad ""would make Brazil happy again."" But many other voters blame the Workers' Party for the deep recession that started on its watch. Every time the polls show Mr. Bolsonaro's popularity growing, the markets rally on the hope that he will curtail social spending and make fiscal changes. Mr. Bolsonaro's supporters also worry that a victory for Mr. Haddad would deal a blow to the Car Wash investigation, which might lead to Mr. da Silva being freed from prison, despite his corruption conviction."
Op-Ed,2018-10-06,"Belgrade Lakes, Me. — My wife and I gathered around the television on Friday to listen to our senior senator, Susan Collins, announce her final decision on the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/opinion/susan-collins-maverick-kavanaugh-trump.html,988," Belgrade Lakes, Me. — My wife and I gathered around the television on Friday to listen to our senior senator, Susan Collins, announce her final decision on the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Four sentences in, she began denouncing ""special interest groups"" who'd opposed him for the court, as if the only entities to weigh in on the nomination had been forces on the left. Six sentences in, she was decrying the groups who'd ""whipped their followers into a frenzy by spreading misrepresentations and outright falsehoods."" We were in the first minute of a speech that would go on for 44 more. ""Uh-oh,"" said my wife. ""She's going to cave."" I nodded, although what I thought in my heart was — had there ever been any doubt? Ms. Collins, our senator since 1996, has a reputation for being an independent; a moderate; even — what was the term? — oh yes, a maverick. But if Ms. Collins is a maverick, then I'm an appaloosa. Yes, she's shown herself willing to buck her party now and again. FiveThirtyEight reports that she votes in line with Donald Trump 79 percent of the time; only Rand Paul of Kentucky, at 74 percent, has a lower score among Senate Republicans. She's opposed the president on immigration and abortion restrictions, net neutrality and his policies toward Russia, Iran and North Korea. But on many key votes, her record is about as moderate as Ted Cruz's. In January, she provided the Republicans with the crucial 51st vote for the tax bill. She set three conditions: the additional passage of two separate bills to shore up insurance markets for individuals who weren't covered through their work, along with a promise for Congress to undo the cuts to Medicare automatically triggered by the deficit increase from the tax cut. After that bill was passed, Ms. Collins said the promises to her were ironclad, and that if her conditions were not met, ""there would be consequences."" But the additional bills never got a vote, and a follow-up attempt to add her provisions to the omnibus spending bill in March was defeated, by other Republicans. Of course they were. As a voter in Maine for the last 30 years, I've been represented by a broad spectrum of independent statesmen and women. During my first year living here, we had dinner in a Skowhegan restaurant called the Heritage House, and at the table next to ours was Margaret Chase Smith, who, of course, stood up against the tactics of Joseph McCarthy in 1950 with her ""Declaration of Conscience"" speech. We stood up to shake her hand. I still remember that moment, the sparkle in her fierce eyes. It was like looking directly into history. We've been represented by other mavericks in the last half-century. Senator William Cohen, another Republican, served as the secretary of defense for a Democratic president, Bill Clinton. George Mitchell, a former Senate majority leader, helped to bring about the Good Friday peace accords in Ireland, and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. For eight years we had an independent governor, Angus King, who has gone on to represent our state as an independent in the Senate. (My wife and I are public supporters of, and have a long friendship with, the Kings.) Being independently minded is a tradition in Maine, as much a part of who we are as lobsters, moose hunting and whoopie pies. But there are different ways of being a maverick. For Smith, it meant taking a stand, opposing McCarthy at the apex of his power. For Arizonan John McCain, it meant voting against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, at least when no provisions had been made for the 20 million Americans who would have suddenly found themselves without health care. There's another kind of ""maverick,"" though — the kind of centrist who wants to please everyone. For Ms. Collins, it's often meant voting with the most right-wing members of her party, even while attempting to occupy some imaginary moral high ground. It's hard to see what our senator got for her vote supporting the tax cut last fall. It's just as hard for me to see her vote for Judge Kavanaugh as anything other than a warm embrace of Donald Trump and everything he stands for, her 45-minute speech notwithstanding. Two years ago, in an op-ed in The Washington Post, she said she would not be voting for him: ""I revere the history of my party, most particularly the value it has always placed on the worth and dignity of the individual, and I will continue to work across the country for Republican candidates. It is because of Mr. Trump's inability and unwillingness to honor that legacy that I am unable to support his candidacy."" And yet, at some of the most crucial moments of Mr. Trump's presidency, she has voted to empower him. In giving him a victory on Judge Kavanaugh, she has emboldened Mr. Trump to continue down the very path she claims to detest: denigrating women, bullying opponents, choosing the most combative approach to every disagreement. Based on the judge's snarling, partisan, bullying demeanor at his hearing, Judge Kavanaugh seems determined to be the kind of justice who is exactly the opposite of that legacy she once spoke of preserving. In so doing, she has proved herself, in the end, to stand for nothing. In her Declaration of Conscience speech, Margaret Chase Smith said that Joe McCarthy had debased the Senate to ""the level of a forum of hate and character assassination."" Last week, Donald Trump ridiculed the suffering of Christine Blasey Ford before a jeering, laughing crowd. Three days later, Ms. Collins voted to confirm his nominee, a man who has pledged to bring exactly the same variety of partisan venom to the Supreme Court. One can only wonder what Margaret Chase Smith would think of Ms. Collins now.

Op-Ed,2018-10-06,"There are too many depressing aspects of Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation on Saturday to enumerate, chief among them what it means for the women of America.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/06/opinion/jocks-high-school-popularity-kavanaugh.html,773," There are too many depressing aspects of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation on Saturday to enumerate, chief among them what it means for the women of America. But Kavanaugh's confirmation also proves something that every former high school freak, floater or orchestra nerd has secretly known all along: The overlords of the cafeteria really do inherit the earth. For those who lived at the margins during high school — and I was one of them, an adolescent made of nerve endings and giant hair and an outsize desire to ingratiate — this is a bitter pill to swallow. The fantasy in most of our imaginations (and Hollywood's: See ""Heathers"" or ""Mean Girls"") is that this gang gets its comeuppance once it's disgorged into the real world. But it doesn't. The academic literature about the fate of the high school in crowd is quite clear. The Renate alumni do very, very well. The future has a name, and it is Squi. Perhaps the most imaginative paper to support this idea was published in 2001. The psychologist Jacquelynne Eccles and two colleagues asked 900 10th graders in Michigan to determine which of the ""Breakfast Club"" characters they identified with the most: the Jock, the Brain, the Princess, the Basket Case or the Criminal. (A tad crude? Sure. But find me another study involving John Hughes that survived peer review.) Roughly a decade later, the researchers checked in. The male Jocks still had the highest self-esteem. They also drank more than any other group, even the Criminals. The Brains were next. (""I liked beer. I still like beer."") In 2012, a group of economists published an intriguing paper showing that popular boys in adolescence earned 10 percent more than those with low status — 35 years later. High school popularity had consequences, including lucrative ones, in the labor market. ""Whether you're looking at popularity, athletic status or attractiveness — all of the data tell you the same thing,"" the sociologist Robert Crosnoe, president of the Society for Research on Adolescence, told me. ""You carry forward into adulthood this legacy of how you operated when you were in high school. What better training ground to learn that you have power and wield it? And why wouldn't you think you're good enough to yell at senators on live television and be a Supreme Court justice 40 years later? You've had 40 years of confirming evidence!"" Crosnoe himself published a book in 2013 about the enduring effects of high school, noting that men and women who were rated good-looking as teenagers made more money than their peers who were merely rated average, even 15 years later, regardless of how they looked in their 30s. He used a sample of thousands of people. (You might reasonably wonder how he knew if these kids were attractive. The answer, I learned, is that people who gather information for the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health actually rate the looks of participating teenagers. At least they were doing so in the name of science, not yearbook trolling.) Does this mean that former geeks and outsiders don't stand a fighting chance in adult life? Of course not. The tech world is teeming with triumphant nerds, and in 2008 we saw the brilliant ascent of an outsider in politics.  Barack Obama felt betwixt and between throughout his adolescence, at loose ends about his racial identity and his place in the world. It was only when he began working as a community organizer that he began to see the many points of commonality he had with his fellow humans. ""They'd offer a story to match or confound mine, a knot to bind our experiences together — a lost father, an adolescent brush with crime, a wandering heart, a moment of simple grace,"" he wrote in ""Dreams From My Father."" ""As time passed, I found that these stories, taken together, had helped me bind my world together, that they gave me the sense of place and purpose I'd been looking for."" Politics became a means for him to reduce the distances between people, and therefore to reduce their sense of shame.  Whereas insiders, members of an exclusive club, tend to induce shame, not reduce it. Which may explain why this moment has surfaced so many ancient feelings of teenage dread. Kavanaugh reads as a very particular type to those who never enjoyed a secure place in adolescence, who never walked the high school halls with the majestic ego of the self-assured.  Kavanaugh and his defenders say his success is proof that he's outgrown his younger self. But the truth is, the data suggests just the opposite. That self predicted exactly who he'd be.

News,2018-10-07,HONG KONG — China is signaling that it is worried about its economy.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/business/china-lending-trade-war.html,1071," HONG KONG — China is signaling that it is worried about its economy. Troubled by slowing growth, persistent debt problems and President Trump's trade war, the Chinese government has taken steps in recent months to shore up its economy. It has pared back a high-profile campaign to tackle debt. It has restarted big infrastructure projects, a traditional economic engine. It has even censored bad economic news. On Sunday, Beijing went one step further. The People's Bank of China, the central bank, pulled a financial lever that will effectively pump $175 billion into the economy. The government is aiming to help small and midsize businesses in particular, which have had trouble obtaining loans and face other rising pressures. The move signals that China's economy ""is really not doing well,"" Chen Shouhong, the founder of the investment information platform Gelonghui, wrote on WeChat, a popular Chinese social media service. The growing trade war with the United States has been the most visible threat. In September, the United States imposed tariffs on $200 billion in goods from China. President Trump has shown little inclination to back off and relations between the two countries have cooled, suggesting the trade war could worsen before it gets better. So far, the trade war has had only a minor impact on China's $12 trillion economy. Trade isn't as important to China as it once was, thanks in part to the rise of a middle class that has been a ready buyer of Chinese goods at home. Still, tariffs could hurt the economy the longer they last. In September, new export orders — one indicator of China's manufacturing — fell to the lowest level since 2016. But China has bigger problems than the trade war. Consumers are spending less. Retail sales this year have grown at the slowest rate in a decade. Wage growth is plodding. Infrastructure investment — a pillar of the Chinese economy — slowed significantly in the first half of the year. The pace at which companies are defaulting on their bonds has quickened. China also has to contend with a stock market that has fallen by around 15 percent this year and a currency that has lost 10 percent of its value against the dollar. Some Chinese entrepreneurs also say the business environment is souring. The government could soon require companies to pay more in taxes and benefits. Government officials in recent months have scurried to counter the broader economic slowdown. They pledged to pump billions of dollars into infrastructure projects, shored up the value of the currency and moved to backstop the falling stock market. China has used these methods for years to spur growth, but they represent a retreat from more recent government efforts to pare back debt. China unleashed a wave of spending and lending beginning a decade ago that rescued its economy from the global economic downturn but left many of its companies and local governments heavily burdened with debt. Economists have warned that China must address its debt problems if it hopes to keep its economy humming. Beijing appeared to be listening. Earlier this year Liu He, a trusted economic adviser to Xi Jinping, the country's top leader, promised to rein in China's debt over the next three years. Mr. Liu's appointment in March as vice premier overseeing financial and industrial policy was seen as a commitment by Chinese officials to crack down on lending. Now, Beijing has changed its tune. In August, the People's Bank of China said it would ensure that money flowed from its state-controlled banking sector to companies that needed it, in particular exporters and small and medium enterprises. The National Development and Reform Commission also flagged concerns about the financing difficulties of private companies in June. The government has promoted rail and other infrastructure projects that were previously stalled or blocked because of concerns about ballooning debt. If it wasn't clear before last week that Chinese officials were concerned about a slowing economy, a move by the government on Sept. 28 to censor negative economic news made it clear. Among the items on a list of forbidden topics on a government directive sent to journalists in China were any economic data that showed a slowing economy, local government debt and risks, and signs of declining consumer confidence. On Sunday, the People's Bank of China said that it would cut the amount of money that some lenders are required to hold in reserve — called the reserve ratio — by one percentage point. The move essentially frees up more money for China's state-controlled banks to lend out. About $65.5 billion of that cash injection will be directed to banks to repay debts that are due in coming weeks, while the rest will be pushed into the financial market. The central bank made the move to ensure ""reasonable and sufficient liquidity"" in China's economy, it said. This is the fourth time this year that the central bank has cut the reserve ratio. But this time, the reserve ratio cut, which is set to go into effect on Oct. 15, was unusually big and broad. While the central bank cut the reserve ratio by a similar amount earlier this year, it put more conditions on how banks could use the extra money. The bank has shied away from making such stark moves in recent years, as it has found more subtle ways to adjust the amount of money in China's financial system depending on its needs. The announcement on Sunday suggests the central bank felt it had to do more than that. The size and breadth of the move, wrote Mr. Chen, the Gelonghui founder, shows ""there are fewer and fewer tools in the P.B.O.C. toolbox."" The move was in direct response to the slowing growth, Zhang Ming, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said on Sunday. Mr. Zhang predicted that China's third-quarter gross domestic product would drop to 6.6 percent growth compared with 6.8 percent a year ago and that its fourth-quarter figure could be as low as 6.4 percent. China posted economic growth of 6.7 percent in the quarter that ended in June, though China's official figures are widely doubted. ""Sino-U.S. trade frictions will further reduce the contribution of imports and exports to economy growth,"" Mr. Zhang, who is also chief economist at Ping An Securities, wrote on WeChat. ""If export growth slows down due to trade frictions, it will influence manufacturing investment growth,"" he added."

News,2018-10-07,"INDIANAPOLIS — The convicted men and women who visit Room B2 of Indianapolis’s courthouse cannot find jobs, or want better ones. Or they wish they could join their children for school field trips. Or they are simply seeking a measure of societal forgiveness.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/us/expungement-criminal-justice.html,1342," INDIANAPOLIS — The convicted men and women who visit Room B2 of Indianapolis's courthouse cannot find jobs, or want better ones. Or they wish they could join their children for school field trips. Or they are simply seeking a measure of societal forgiveness. They all arrive with the same aspiration: expungements intended to ease the burdens of old criminal records. ""I had to talk my way into a lot of places because of my background,"" said a woman named Fernell, who stopped by the subbasement room on a recent morning to discuss a conviction for resisting law enforcement when she was 19. ""I want to put it behind me."" What she and most visitors to Room B2 are finding is that the people who helped get them convicted in the first place now want to help make the black marks less perilous. Bolstered by a renewed focus, from the Trump administration on down, on helping people with criminal histories participate in society successfully, at least 20 states have created or broadened expungement and sealing laws since the beginning of 2017, according to the Collateral Consequences Resource Center, a nonprofit group. And although law enforcement officials have traditionally opposed such measures for an array of reasons — including accountability, a belief that records are vital to public safety, and unstinting support for crime victims — a growing number of them have begun to recognize that criminal records can be enduring obstacles to self-sufficiency and even help trap people in cycles of crime. Increasingly, they are overtly endorsing mercy through record suppression. ""It's just a matter of trying to remove obstacles that would make it more difficult for someone to become a productive member of the community,"" said Terry Curry, the elected prosecutor in Marion County, which includes Indianapolis and has a population approaching 1 million residents. ""If an individual has stayed out of the criminal justice system, then why should they continue to have that stain forever?"" Though in most places the paperwork burden for expungements has fallen on private lawyers and nonprofit legal clinics, South Florida prosecutors now routinely hold events intended to help people wipe away records of arrests but not convictions. A district attorney in rural Louisiana leads information sessions about expungements for some felony convictions after a 10-year waiting period; a Vermont prosecutor recently held a record-clearing clinic; and the authorities near Fort Bragg, N.C., attracted about 500 people to an expungement event last year. Last month, the Brooklyn district attorney promoted ""Begin Again"" events, where, one advertisement said, people were invited to ""clear your record of a misdemeanor marijuana conviction or warrant."" But there is still a national patchwork of policies and terminologies, from destroying records to sealing them to simply noting that a conviction is effectively vacated. States have imposed various waiting periods, conditions and fees. Some places have made their processes deliberately simple, while others have complicated approaches that may require legal assistance or court hearings. The proliferation of new laws, and newfound enthusiasm on the part of some prosecutors, has hardly erased all doubts about the wisdom of suppressing records. Many prosecutors, especially in rural areas, remain skeptical of any action to show mercy for a person's past, and some judges engage in measured resistance, holding hearings more to complain about an expungement law than to weigh an application's merits. ""You have prosecutors and judges who just think it's wrong: 'You've caused trouble in this county, you're a wrongdoer and you shouldn't get a blank slate,'"" said Bernice Corley, the executive director of the Indiana Public Defender Council. But Margaret Love, the executive director of the Collateral Consequences Resource Center and a former United States pardon attorney, said that clemency and expungements are part of the criminal justice process for a reason. ""It ought to be something that prosecutors welcome and use to their advantage to create criminal justice success stories, to advertise criminal justice success stories,"" she said. The nuanced approach in Indiana, where officials hoped that expungements would improve people's job prospects, is increasingly seen as a model. Under its so-called Second Chance law, the state has a tiered system in which the offense, and the outcome of the case, determines the waiting period and the exact relief. Indiana does not destroy records, but can limit access to them and mark them as expunged, and crime victims are permitted to express their views before any decision is made. ""Indiana should be the worst place in America to commit a serious crime and the best place, once you've done your time, to get a second chance,"" Gov. Mike Pence, now the vice president, said when he signed the records measure into law in 2013. There have been misgivings. Steven P. Sonnega, the prosecutor in a county just southwest of Indianapolis, unsuccessfully challenged Indiana's law in court. He declined to be interviewed but, in an email in September, said that ""expungement is now part of the law in Indiana, and it's our legal duty to follow the law."" Other prosecutors, like Mr. Curry, proved more enthusiastic, backed by local law clinics and nonprofit organizations. Since the law went into effect in July 2013, his prosecutors have reviewed about 11,500 petitions, encompassing about 45,000 criminal cases. According to the prosecutor's office, about 60 percent have focused on convictions, not just records of arrests. Many cases concerned relatively minor offenses like prostitution and driving with a suspended license, lawyers involved in the process said. ""The key is you protect the public, and protecting the public means a whole lot of options,"" said Andrew J. Fogle, the deputy prosecutor Mr. Curry assigned to handle expungement petitions, including one for an arrest in the late 1950s. ""To tail them, nail them, jail them is not a totally acceptable option."" And so down Market Street from the Capitol, past the nearly 285-foot-tall Soldiers and Sailors Monument, the local courthouse has become one of the state's busiest proving grounds for the law. In Room B2, an Expungement Help Desk, operated by a local nonprofit in space lent by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, offers information and assistance with paperwork but not explicit legal advice. From time to time, Mr. Fogle shows people the way to the help desk, which is on pace to work on more than 1,500 petitions this year, up from 986 in 2017. ""We try to make it a friendly place and not intimidating,"" said Julie Mennel, the paralegal who leads the help desk and, using brightly colored posters and paintings, has tried to set it apart from the adversarial justice system operating upstairs. ""We're here to help people, not judge people. They've already had judgment passed."" On a recent Thursday, an elderly African-American couple sat at a desk, talking with a law student about an old conviction for marijuana possession. A far younger white man named Fred with a long record announced, laughing, that he would need to return the next day to finish his paperwork with Ms. Mennel. Fernell, the woman with the conviction for resisting law enforcement, sat anxiously in a chair along a wall and waited to talk with someone. She asked that her last name not be used to avoid undoing what she hopes will come with an expungement: better employment and educational prospects. Before she became eligible for expungement, three fast-food restaurants, she said, had rejected her for jobs because of her teenage behavior. ""A new beginning for me means I can grow with my business, my own interests,"" said Fernell, 24. ""I knew I wanted it done, but I was waiting it out for five years."" Perhaps her greatest ally had left the room only minutes before: Mr. Fogle, the deputy prosecutor who sometimes escorts people to the help desk and, speaking generally, said he was typically looking for a reason to support cleaning up a record. ""We're not just doing lip service to this,"" he said.

Review,2018-10-07,"LOS ANGELES — Until now, it has been possible to talk about “the Andrew Norman style” as though that were some settled thing.

Several of this young composer's major pieces — bearing active titles like ""Play,"" ""Try"" and ""Switch"" — have hurtled, from their opening minutes, with volleys of intensity that rival the kinetic climaxes of other artists. And then, with that established, he can really go to town. Given this creative profile, the title of Mr. Norman's latest orchestral work, ""Sustain,"" hinted at an intriguing about-face. Steadiness and stasis have not been his calling cards. And in a recent interview with Joshua Barone of The New York Times, Mr. Norman described a desire to ""relearn my language"" when fulfilling this Los Angeles Philharmonic co-commission. That was not idle talk. Saturday night's performance by the Philharmonic and its music director, Gustavo Dudamel, here at their Walt Disney Concert Hall home underlined just how willingly Mr. Norman has inverted his established practices. Instead of quickly fostering a riot of competing rhythms and motifs, this composition deals in repetitive material for long stretches over its approximately 45-minute length. Percussive interjections and unpredictable collisions of melody are the exception, rather than the rule. During the opening minutes, the composer asks individual strings to play select tones from attractively mystic modes — and then hold each one for a spell. (This ""sustain"" is one aspect of the title.) The staggered approach made the steady ascents and descents through the pitches seem less like composer-directed themes and more like seesawing laws of nature, perfectly in balance. Initially, the effect was sublime, in addition to being a compelling realization of the ecological concerns the composer detailed in his program note. (Ideas regarding environmental sustainability — and its all-too-probable opposite — give the title additional weight.) Still, during the first third of ""Sustain,"" the lack of much rhythmic thrust occasionally threatened to make the work seem aimless. At one point, I noticed myself breathing a sigh of relief when an exciting new dance for flute and vibraphone rose up from the well-trod ground. (It was the first time I'd ever been anxious for the next change when listening to Mr. Norman's music.) Yet gradually, I came to love the consequences of this pacing. Whereas many of his past works have been all about focusing on each new improbable element as it stomps to the fore, here, Mr. Norman's complexity has a lighter footprint. As the strings are painting with those long tones, a smaller group of wind instruments might divebomb through the frame, without causing a commotion. Minimalist motors can possess the trumpets, for a few moments, without scrambling the overall narrative. Over the final third of ""Sustain,"" this unusual merger between restraint and hyperactivity could hypnotize. When reading that the score calls for two pianos, tuned a quarter-tone apart, you might reasonably expect some microtonal fireworks. But the dissonances between the pianos are only ever highlighted gently, at hinge points when both are clearly audible. At other junctures, the pianos seemed content to let their collective resonance slip mysteriously into the background. Even when the dynamic level increases to an undeniable roar, there is a smoothness to the piece. Bringing all this across requires an orchestra of considerable dexterity (and patience). The Los Angeles players seemed to savor the material, even when it did not seem obviously virtuosic in nature. Mr. Dudamel succeeded in channeling the slyness of Mr. Norman's writing, too. Taking the transitions in too showy a manner might prove deadly to its overall designs; wisely, Mr. Dudamel built to the passages of pandemonium with a gratifying steeliness of purpose. Perhaps the musicians felt secure in these choices, thanks to the inclusion of another piece on the program (which was to repeat on Sunday) that allowed them to strut more ecstatically. The 1996 composition ""LA Variations,"" by the former Los Angeles Philharmonic music director Esa-Pekka Salonen, was designed as a showcase for this orchestra, and it continues to sound marvelous in its hands. The work's varied instrumental colors are still Technicolor in their projected brilliance. The balance — even in thickly orchestrated passages — still has a punchy vibrancy worthy of a surround-sound theater mix. And its final minutes may have gained some rhythmic buoyancy under Mr. Dudamel's watch. Somewhat less dazzling was the orchestra's trip through Beethoven's Op. 56 (known as the ""Triple Concerto""). The piano, violin and cello soloists — all drawn from the Philharmonic's regular cast — carried a brisk energy throughout the demanding work. Yet they could also sound taxed during some of its toughest slaloms. Mr. Dudamel pushed out some effervescent, courtly pulses, though this sometimes necessitated speeding past the work's most captivating harmonic turns. Though as it happens, this orchestra has not planned or marketed its centennial season around the standard repertory. With more than 50 commissions planned for this year — and mini-festivals devoted both to the Harlem Renaissance and to the composers associated with the Fluxus movement — the Los Angeles Philharmonic is going big on modern and contemporary items. During this first weekend of its season, the orchestra's skill in works written over the past three decades amounted to a thrilling omen for the coming year."
News,2018-10-07,"GENEVA — Up in the convention center balcony on Day 1 of the World Health Organization’s tobacco treaty negotiations last week, two men posted invitations to a party on the lake.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/health/tobacco-e-cigarettes-treaty.html,1539," GENEVA — Up in the convention center balcony on Day 1 of the World Health Organization's tobacco treaty negotiations last week, two men posted invitations to a party on the lake. The event, called the ""Nicotine Is Not Your Enemy Soirée,"" was held at La Potinière, a posh restaurant with views of the city's soaring Jet d'Eau fountain and the Alps beyond. There, guests enjoyed tapas and an open bar, passed around e-cigarette samples and listened to an industry advocate, Bernhard-Michael Mayer, scorn antivaping activists for insisting on proof that e-cigarettes aren't harmful. It's impossible, he said, to prove that even a piece of fruit is entirely harmless. To Dr. Mayer and the party sponsor — the Consumer Choice Center, which is partly funded by the tobacco industry — the message was urgent. Down the road, delegates from 137 countries were debating whether to crack down on e-cigarettes and other nicotine delivery devices — or embrace them as safer alternatives to traditional cigarettes. The delegates were there for the regular biannual session to update the health organization's world tobacco treaty, formally known as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Since it took effect in 2005, the treaty has had an enormous impact on public health. It is credited with reducing tobacco use in many countries through advertising bans, graphic package warnings, smoke-free workplaces, and tobacco taxes, among other controls. But this year the delegates, along with public health regulators around the world, are facing a new, pressing question: what to do about the explosive growth of alternatives to combustible cigarettes. Among the devices being grappled with are e-cigarettes, through which users inhale flavored nicotine vapor; so-called heat-not-burn devices, which warm tobacco sticks but do not release carcinogens by igniting them; and new electronic products like Juul, a flash drive look-alike whose popularity has made it a scourge in American secondary schools. All boast to be safer than traditional cigarettes because they do not create the toxic smoke that comes from burning tobacco. But there are unanswered questions about the health effects of the chemicals that users do inhale, and public health officials worry that the devices are luring too many nonsmokers, creating new generation of nicotine addicts. ""Every jurisdiction in the world is struggling with e-cigarettes,"" said Dr. Judith Mackay, a longtime tobacco industry expert and senior adviser to Vital Strategies, the global health advocacy group, at the event. ""Do they encourage young people to start smoking, and do they actually encourage smokers to quit? It will be a few years before we know the answer."" The stakes are high for the big tobacco companies, which have increasingly bought up small vaping companies, and launched new alternative nicotine products in the face of declining smoking rates and threats to impose ceilings on nicotine in traditional cigarettes to reduce it to levels that don't create addiction. Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco and other traditional tobacco companies now sell alternative nicotine delivery devices. And so, though the negotiations were closed to corporate interests, the prospect of reaching 137 countries that control their fate brought industry representatives to this city in swarms. ""Ousting one group of companies from giving their views and sharing their expertise contradicts basic democratic principles,"" said Michiel Reerink, a vice president of Japan Tobacco International, a funder of the group that held the ""Nicotine Is Not Your Enemy"" party. Two of the party organizers, Fred Roeder and Yaël Ossowski, registered as journalists to get access to sessions and walked freely around the conference center wearing press badges. Later, the bureau overseeing the negotiations suspended their badges, citing ""misrepresentation."" Philip Morris International set up a ""PMI Science Engagement Hub"" to explain the company's transformation from maker of Marlboro cigarettes to maker of Marlboro HeatSticks, and watch a machine compare cigarette smoke and heatstick vapor. A group of people stood outside the convention hall handing out a glossy report titled ""No Fire, No Smoke: Global State of Tobacco Harm Reduction."" It was written by Knowledge-Action-Change, an organization that receives funding from the Philip Morris Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. Its message: There is ""a third way beyond quit or die."" The W.H.O. maintains that the current wording of the treaty covers all forms of tobacco, including heat-not-burn devices, not just traditional cigarettes. The treaty does not officially cover e-cigarettes, however, because officials don't define them as tobacco products. During the session, the industry advocates, along with some public health experts, were pushing for the delegates to officially embrace all types of alternative devices as harm-reduction tools to help smokers quit — and to exempt heat-not-burn and others from the treaty's restrictions. While countries have been generally unified in their approach to regulating traditional cigarettes since the treaty took effect, regulation of alternative nicotine devices including e-cigarettes varies widely around the world. Australia has banned the sale and marketing of liquid nicotine used in e-cigarettes. Israel has banned Juul's highest-concentration nicotine pod, but allows a less intense one. . In Japan the IQOS, the heat-not-burn device from Philip Morris International, has a 15 percent tobacco market share, the company says. But in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has not yet allowed the IQOS on the market. The F.D.A. is also in the midst of a crackdown on e-cigarette makers and retailers for not keeping the products away from minors. It has demanded that Juul and other makers turn over troves of marketing and research documents. In September it conducted a surprise inspection of Juul headquarters in San Francisco and carted away more records. The agency also recently gave Juul 60 days to prove it could keep its devices away from youths, or risk a ban on its products. Despite drops in smoking rates around the world, seven million people still die each year from tobacco-related diseases. In a letter to the W.H.O. director general on the first day of the negotiations, 72 academics and public health specialists urged the delegates to give more weight to the benefits of new, noncombustible devices, and added that ""uncertainty about long-term effects should not be a reason for paralysis."" ""We believe it is time for tobacco control to embrace tobacco harm reduction,"" the group wrote. ""We propose that W.H.O. and related stakeholders adopt a more positive approach to new technologies and innovations that have the potential to bring the epidemic of smoking-caused disease to a more rapid conclusion."" David B. Abrams, a New York University addiction specialist who has discussed the issue with Juul and others, said tobacco control advocates were overlooking the benefits of alternatives to traditional cigarettes. ""I believe history will prove them wrong as the whole truth and the strongest science will emerge in the long run, as it always does,"" Dr. Abrams said. Others, among them Francis Thompson, executive director of the Framework Convention Alliance, a coalition of roughly 500 organizations devoted to supporting treaty implementation, asked members not to let the e-cigarette debate divert them from the larger issue of industry interference in carrying out the treaty. ""We have a really good treaty,"" Mr. Thompson said. ""The problem is when you actually look at the implementation level, you realize it's maybe one-fifth implemented."" ""The urgent issue,"" he said, ""is that millions of people are dying from tobacco products already on the market."" Down the street from the convention center, at the N'vY Hotel, Philip Morris International was trying to reinforce that message to anyone venturing into its Science Hub, with a touch screen that told the company's story of moving into the harm-reduction business. Plates of colorful macarons were positioned at the entry. Moira Gilchrist, a vice president of Philip Morris International, said the company was trying to promote the business's new policy of transparency to the delegates and anyone else at the meeting. ""Anyone who is interested in alternatives to cigarettes that can be offered to the world's billion smokers is invited here to see the science we have, which we believe is really promising,"" Ms. Gilchrist said. ""Part of why we are here today is encouraging policymakers not to treat every single tobacco product as the same."" Addressing lingering suspicions about the role of Big Tobacco, Ms. Gilchrist said: ""We are absolutely not asking people to believe us. We're asking people to replicate our science, to review our science and come to their own conclusions."" ""We're not asking for forgiveness,"" she added. But many delegates interviewed at the convention remained wary of electronic nicotine delivery devices, and as the session wrapped up on Saturday, they approved a directive affirming that heat-not-burn products should continue to be subject to the same restrictions as other tobacco products, like cigarettes. They declined to offer an endorsement or special treatment to any alternate nicotine delivery systems. ""It's not a victory for vaping,"" said Matthew L. Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, who took part in the long debate Thursday night. ""They would like to be treated differently in every respect."" So the debate will continue. ""We believe there is room for these alternative products and believe it has to be well studied and well investigated,"" said Dr. Ghazi Zaatari, a delegate and medical school professor in Lebanon, who oversaw some of the conference's research. ""We have been fooled before."""

In recent years, the Nobel committee has tended to honor economists who focus on the mechanics of individual behavior, rather than the authors of grand macroeconomic theories. Last year's winner was the behavioral economist Richard Thaler, who was recognized for his work demonstrating that people are predictably irrational — that human behavior defies economic theory in ways that are both consistent and foreseeable. — Binyamin Appelbaum TECHNOLOGY Google continues its uphill battle in the consumer hardware business. The company on Tuesday is expected to unveil an array of products, including its third-generation Pixel smartphones, at an event in New York. Though the Pixel phones have received glowing reviews, they are still small sellers compared with Apple iPhones and Samsung devices. — Brian X. Chen ECONOMY On Thursday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will announce its reading of the Consumer Price Index for September. Inflation has been tame lately, despite a strong economy, and the C.P.I. is expected to reflect that. The overall index and the core components are both expected to rise 0.2 percent. On the other hand, a stronger-than-expected figure could unnerve investors already concerned about rising interest rates. — Nelson D. Schwartz ECONOMY The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund gather for their annual meetings this week on the Indonesian island of Bali. The gatherings come as politicians in countries like the United States have rebuked multilateralism and openly questioned the value of international institutions like the World Bank and I.M.F. Officials gathered in Bali will probably address the rising tensions between the United States and China. Christine Lagarde, the head of the I.M.F., is expected to address how trade can be an engine of growth for all nations. Also on the agenda: how the global economy is at risk of another economic crisis, something that the I.M.F. warned about in its recent Global Financial Stability Report.  — Alexandra Stevenson BANKING  Bank earnings season begins this week with the first three megabanks revealing their third-quarter results on Friday. Reports are due from JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup before the stock market opens. Investors will be looking at their loan growth, which could be stronger than it was in last year's third quarter thanks to a better overall economy. Their trading businesses may have suffered again. — Emily Flitter"
News,2018-10-07,"In the final months of President Obama’s administration, the government’s top consumer regulator was negotiating a large settlement with the student loan collector Navient, which it said had misled borrowers and made mistakes that added billions of dollars to their bills.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/business/student-loans-navient.html,1350," In the final months of President Obama's administration, the government's top consumer regulator was negotiating a large settlement with the student loan collector Navient, which it said had misled borrowers and made mistakes that added billions of dollars to their bills. But after President Trump's victory, the talks between the company and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau broke down. Two days before his inauguration, the bureau sued Navient, accusing it of ""systematically and illegally failing borrowers at every stage of repayment."" Two states, Illinois and Washington, simultaneously filed their own suits in state courts. As the bureau has taken a softer approach toward industries, including payday lending, and had its own acting director say it too often exceeds its authority, the possibility that the Trump administration will ease up on Navient has prompted more states to join the legal fray. Five have now sued Navient, two of them within the past four months. ""There is growing concern among myself and state attorneys general that the federal government is not only losing interest in holding student loan servicers like Navient accountable, but that the federal government is actively looking for ways to shut down state enforcement actions against Navient and other student loan servicers,"" said Jim Hood, the Mississippi attorney general, who sued Navient in July. ""The timing of filing our lawsuit reflects that concern."" Two years ago, Navient was willing to reach a settlement to end the bureau's three-year investigation. It would adjust how it serviced loans and write off some private loans it owned that were considered predatory, according to three people familiar with the talks. But after Election Day, there was a greater sense of urgency from officials at the bureau — a frequent target for criticism by Republicans. The bureau and a group of state attorneys general, who were conducting their own investigation, aimed high: fines and debt relief that together would have topped $1 billion, the people said. The talks fell apart, prompting suits against Navient alleging that the company had harmed hundreds of thousands of borrowers by failing to steer them toward the loan repayment options that would have been best for them. Borrowers incurred nearly $4 billion in additional interest charges that could have been avoided, the plaintiffs argued in legal filings. Among the other claims: Navient repeatedly misallocated payments and incorrectly reported to credit bureaus that some disabled borrowers — including military veterans — had defaulted when their loans had actually been forgiven. Navient has denied any wrongdoing. ""We have helped millions of borrowers enroll in income-driven repayment and successfully repay their loans,"" said Nikki Lavoie, a company spokeswoman. If Navient loses in court, the company could be required to pay billions of dollars in damages and overhaul the way it handles the accounts of some six million borrowers. A defeat could also prompt other servicers to change their policies: Navient is one of eight companies paid by the Education Department to handle the $1.4 trillion owed by 42 million federal loan borrowers. ""These problems are not just limited to Navient; these are practices we have seen at many different servicers,"" said Persis Yu, the director of the National Consumer Law Center's Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project. ""It's critical to finally have a federal agency acknowledge the problems and hold a company accountable for them."" In public, Navient promotes its commitment to guiding borrowers. ""We are here to help you successfully navigate paying your student loans,"" it says on its website. But in court, Navient has said those assurances are strictly marketing hype. ""It's friendly talk, it's puffery, but it is not the stuff of a legal obligation to now become your financial counselor,"" Navient's lawyer told a federal judge in Pennsylvania as part of a request to dismiss the bureau's lawsuit. Judge Robert D. Mariani denied the request. It is reasonable for borrowers to assume that their loan servicer will act in their best interests, and Navient's ""active conduct created a duty to act in accordance with their own statements,"" he wrote. Judges overseeing the Illinois and Washington cases have also rejected dismissal requests. With the state and federal cases progressing, Navient has stepped up its efforts to personally connect with the government officials leading the enforcement efforts against it. The company has met with leaders at the federal consumer bureau, hired two former Democratic attorneys general as advisers and begun donating to networking groups that help state attorneys general raise campaign cash. The states' lawsuits will take on increased importance if the consumer bureau drops its case against Navient. Such concerns were obliquely alluded to in a scathing resignation letter sent in August by the agency's student loan ombudsman, Seth Frotman. Mr. Frotman stepped down while criticizing the bureau's interim director, Mick Mulvaney, for putting the interests of powerful businesses ahead of consumers ""harmed by the company that dominates this market."" In an interview last month with CNBC, Mr. Mulvaney said he worried about the consequences, ""from a financial standpoint and a moral standpoint,"" of the growing number of student borrowers who fail to pay off their debts. Navient has openly sought to have the bureau's lawsuit dropped. ""There is no evidence to date to support their case,"" John F. Remondi, Navient's chief executive, told analysts on Navient's most recent earnings call. ""Our arguments here are, you've had five years to look for your evidence, you found none, it's time to move on."" Navient also made that argument privately to Mr. Mulvaney, who is also Mr. Trump's budget director, in February in an email requesting a meeting. The email was obtained through a public records request. Mr. Remondi called the lawsuit against his company ""a prime example of what was wrong with the bureau"" under Mr. Mulvaney's predecessor. He also repeated a number of Mr. Mulvaney's own talking points, accusing the bureau of trying ""to make law through enforcement actions."" Four months later, Mr. Remondi met with a group of the bureau's lawyers and one of Mr. Mulvaney's top aides, Eric Blankenstein, the political appointee in charge of the bureau's enforcement division, who has lately faced criticism for past racial comments. According to the two people familiar with the agency's internal discussions, Mr. Blankenstein has particularly scrutinized the claims at the heart of the lawsuit: that Navient steered borrowers into more costly repayment options that were administratively simpler for the company. A spokesman for the bureau declined to comment. Navient is also ensuring that it directly reaches those who have authority to decide whether the state cases go forward. Last year, the company retained two former attorneys general — Douglas F. Gansler of Maryland and Martha Coakley of Massachusetts, both Democrats — to help it communicate with their peers. Ms. Coakley said her Navient work was focused on helping state officials better understand the company. Mr. Gansler said he was helping Navient ""get its narrative out there."" And in March, Navient joined the Republican and Democratic Attorneys General Associations, paying $15,000 to each to do so. It was the company's first such contribution to the groups. Three months later, Mr. Remondi spoke at the Democratic association's summer policy conference in Seattle, joining a panel discussion about how to help borrowers avoid a lifetime of debt. For about 15 minutes — until Ellen Rosenblum, the Oregon attorney general, who moderated the panel discussion, cut him off — Mr. Remondi spoke about Navient's efforts to help federal loan borrowers navigate their repayment options and avoid falling behind, according to meeting attendees. His pitch failed to sway Xavier Becerra, California's attorney general, who had one of his top aides on the panel with Mr. Remondi. Three weeks later, his office sued Navient. Right after the lawsuit was announced, Senya Merchant, a program manager at the Center for American Progress, a progressive advocacy group, sent a message to one of Mr. Becerra's advisers. ""Do you think this would supplant the C.F.P.B. suit in case that one gets dropped?"" Ms. Merchant wrote in an email, which was obtained through a public records request. ""I can't speculate,"" replied the adviser, Sarah Lovenheim, ""but that's a good question."""
