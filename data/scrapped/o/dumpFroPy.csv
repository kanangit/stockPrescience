News,2007-01-13,STOCKHOLM,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/13/world/europe/13profile.html,1237," STOCKHOLM NYAMKO SABUNI would stand out anyway, being tiny, dark-skinned and obviously foreign in a place where those things are still anomalies. But as the recently appointed minister for integration and gender equality, she tends to draw more attention for her unusually blunt pronouncements about the place of immigrants in Swedish society. As an opposition politician, Ms. Sabuni proposed banning the veil for girls under the age of 15. She proposed that schoolgirls undergo compulsory medical examinations to check for evidence of genital mutilation. She denounced what she called the ""honor culture"" of some immigrant groups, proposed outlawing arranged marriages and called for an end to state financing of religious schools. Even as furious immigrant and minority groups demand that she be removed from her post, Ms. Sabuni, 37, insists that she is not as extreme as people make her out to be. Given that Sweden is governed by a coalition in which parliamentary votes cannot always be counted on, it is unlikely, anyway, that most of her ideas could plausibly translate into actual law. Nonetheless, she stands by her basic premise: that immigrants must try harder to fit in to their adopted country. ""A lot of people misread their rights,"" she said recently. ""They think that freedom of religion means that they can do anything in the name of religion, or that human rights means that they can act however they want against others."" Not true, she said. ""If they want to live here, have kids, have grandchildren, they must make an effort to adapt to the society where they live."" Ms. Sabuni comes across as a dervish, all business and kinetic energy. Barely taller than five feet,  she strode to lunch in a private dining room in Sweden's handsome main government office building. She was interviewed in English and answered back in rapid, precisely enunciated Swedish, explaining in perfect English that ""I would prefer to speak in a language that I speak fluently."" The daughter of a frequently jailed opposition politician in Congo, then Zaire,  who fled to Sweden as a political refugee, Ms. Sabuni has a past so singular for Sweden that she arguably represents a minority of one. The story of how she arrived here with her parents and five of her siblings at the age of 12, learned Swedish, thrived in school and in college and ultimately got elected to Parliament and elevated to the cabinet is almost American in its can-do trajectory. IF there is such a thing as a Swedish dream, Ms. Sabuni embodies it. Never, she says, has she let herself feel like a victim or felt anything but accepted. Even putting aside her native French and Swahili for Swedish proved fairly easy, she insists. She holds firm to that view even though, before entering Parliament, she was regularly turned away from the jobs for which she applied, she said, getting work only through contacts or by being recruited. But she refuses to dwell on it. ""You can end up in a negative spiral where you attribute everything that goes wrong to discrimination,"" she said. Ms. Sabuni has certainly been helped in her career by the Scandinavian-style feminism of her husband, Carl Bergquist, whom she began dating when she was 24 and he was 47. His regular hours at a travel agency allow him to devote himself to the housework and their children, 5-year-old twins, leaving Ms. Sabuni free to train her disciplined mind on her work. The path of a migrant to Sweden is not so easy and clear as it was when the Sabunis arrived in 1981, their relocation arranged by Amnesty International. About 12 percent of the population of nine million is now foreign-born; Muslims account for some 450,000. Swedes are far less likely to welcome new arrivals now. Newcomers, who often live in rundown immigrant neighborhoods, are less likely to learn Swedish and more likely to go to all-immigrant schools and to remain unemployed and poor. Sweden's experience has been mirrored across Europe, where governments with histories of tolerance are struggling to find a way to absorb growing immigrant populations, particularly Muslims. Some countries, like Denmark, have passed tough anti-immigrant laws; others, like Britain, are rethinking the live-and-let-live policies they now believe have failed. Luciano Astudillo, a member of Parliament and the spokesman for immigration issues for the opposition Social Democrats here, said Sweden must move quickly to address its problems. Even though he believes that Ms. Sabuni's fiery statements while in the opposition were delivered more for political consumption than as serious propositions, Mr. Astudillo said that she had proved nothing but divisive. ""She has used very simplistic and general language when talking about problems,"" he said. ""She has often been the person who stressed the divisions instead of finding what brings us together."" But Ms. Sabuni, who grew up nonreligious although her mother is Muslim and her father Christian, says that on the contrary, she is eager to start a coherent dialogue. Muslims in particular have marginalized themselves by conveying an impression of intolerance and aversion to change, she said. ""Practicing Muslims who live by the word of the Koran and the Koranic books — of course they limit their own opportunities,"" she said. ""A lot of people who live like me, or practicing Muslims who respect that religion is a private matter, have had it easier than those who think religion should be part of a larger society. Ms. Subuni said many say, "" 'I need to pray five times a day because my religion says so.' "" But she  added: ""Which employer will accept that? Or, 'My child shouldn't take part in music class, because my religion questions this.' O.K., then we have a problem."" AS the minister for gender equality, she is particularly troubled at evidence that young Muslim girls are wearing the veil. ""I would like to know what is happening in our society that makes families want to put a veil"" on our children, she said. ""Maybe we don't need a law. Maybe we need something else so that people don't feel so insecure that they need to manifest their religion by using their children."" Such talk infuriates Sweden's Muslim groups, who say that Ms. Sabuni is unfairly singling them out while avoiding pressing issues like unemployment. And, they say, she has essentially betrayed her past. ""I'm happy that she's a foreigner, and I'm happy about the color of her skin, but I think maybe she has lost the connection to the immigrant communities,"" said Helena Benaouda, chairwoman of the Muslim Council of Sweden, the country's largest Muslim group. ""Maybe she has thought too much about herself and her political career, and she should try to remember that she's not representing just herself."" But Ms. Sabuni said that she was indeed sympathetic and that she fully understood that both sides — Sweden, and its immigrants — had to change. ""We have a society that has failed to adapt to new times,"" she said. ""We don't offer people their rights, but we are also unclear about their obligations. So people end up in a kind of no man's land, where they are neither Swedes, nor Turks nor Congolese."" She said she would identify herself as ""Afro-Swedish, maybe."" But, she added, ""I feel cosmopolitan. As long as I have my parents, my siblings, my family with me, I think I could fit in almost anywhere."""
News,2007-01-16," SODERTALJE, Sweden — Former residents of Baghdad living in this calm Swedish town know why they left. “Iraq is finished,” said Taghreed Ewas, 34, a chemical engineer who fled last year after she received several death threats and narrowly escaped a kidnapping. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/16/world/europe/16sweden.html,862," SODERTALJE, Sweden — Former residents of Baghdad living in this calm Swedish town know why they left. ""Iraq is finished,"" said Taghreed Ewas, 34, a chemical engineer who fled last year after she received several death threats and narrowly escaped a kidnapping. As they flee the mayhem of their homeland, Iraqis have swarmed into neighboring countries in the Middle East by the hundreds of thousands. But they are also increasingly coming to Europe, especially Sweden, one indication of how the war in Iraq is now beginning to have serious consequences for countries far beyond its borders. Last year, 8,951 Iraqis applied for asylum in Sweden, up from 2,330 in 2005. Of those, almost 3,000 arrived in November and December. Those choosing this relatively small country of nine million people represent nearly half of the Iraqi refugees arriving in Europe and surpass by far the number admitted to the United States each year. ""We don't use words like flood, but it's clear that it's a very large increase,"" said Krister Isaksson, a forecast analyst at the Swedish Migration Board. ""We see no reasons why it would slow down. Instead we believe it might continue to increase."" Ms. Ewas, who fled with the help of smugglers through northern Iraq and Turkey, leaving much of her family behind, has little hope of returning to Iraq. ""Every day there is worse than the day before,"" she said at an immigrant reception center here. The mass exodus of Iraqis spawned by the deteriorating security situation at home is having the most extreme effect on Iraq's neighbors. The United Nations refugee agency estimates that 500,000 to 1 million displaced Iraqis are in Syria; up to 700,000 in Jordan; 20,000 to 80,000 in Egypt; and up to 40,000 in Lebanon. But the agency has begun warning that the crisis is spreading beyond the Middle East. In late December, it issued an advisory to governments recommending that asylum seekers from southern and central Iraq ""be favorably considered as refugees under the 1951 Refugee Convention."" ""People have been optimistic, hoping that the situation would get better,"" said Paal Aarsaether, the agency's spokesman for the Nordic countries. ""But now the international community has realized that this has to be dealt with."" Sweden's relatively liberal asylum laws and immigration regulations have made it by far the most attractive destination in Europe for Iraqi refugees, Ms. Isaksson said. Of the 16,261 Iraqis who applied for asylum in Western Europe from January to November last year, about 45 percent came to Sweden. In November, when 1,413 arrived here, only 13 applied in France, 65 in Denmark and 230 in Germany. ""We give Iraqis residence permits to an extent that isn't done in the rest of Europe,"" Ms. Isaksson said. Unlike countries that require language knowledge or economic guarantees, she said, citing Denmark and the Netherlands, ""we don't put many demands on immigrants."" Another factor is that more than 80,000 Iraqis already live in Sweden, forming the country's second largest immigrant group, after Finns. Many refugees come because they have relatives here. Sodertalje, a scenic industrial town about 20 miles southwest of Stockholm, is home not just to the truckmaker Scania, which has its main factory here, but also to a thriving and growing population of Iraqis, most of them Christians. Ms. Ewas chose Sodertalje because her brother lives here. The rapid increase in Iraqi immigrants is having an impact on the communities where they settle. At Sodertalje's immigrant reception center, a converted factory building where refugees and other immigrants come to register with the local authorities, the situation borders on chaotic, said Catharina Helling, the center's director. ""We are feeling the strain,"" Ms. Helling said, noting that the center's staff has increased to 25 from 8 a year ago. She said that the municipality is having problems recruiting Swedish-language teachers. In December, 131 new immigrants registered at the center, all of them Iraqis. ""This doesn't happen without pain,"" Ms. Helling said. Those who arrive also increasingly bring memories of truly harrowing experiences from the chaos in Iraq. The center has hired two staff members to give the refugees counseling, but Ms. Helling admits that this is not enough given the help and understanding many Iraqi refugees need. One woman who stopped in at the center this week was Nooralhuda, 63, who arrived in Sodertalje in late 2005. She declined to give her last name because, she said, she is still ""living in fear."" She left Baghdad after her daughter and three young granddaughters were kidnapped. A few days after their disappearance she was attacked in her home, but survived, and her neighbors persuaded her to flee. She now lives with her son and his family here in Sodertalje. Nooralhuda said she had not given up hope that her daughter and granddaughters might turn up alive. She often calls her neighbors to ask if they have heard something, she said. ""For Iraq, there is no hope,"" she said. ""For me, my wish is that I get word that my daughter and granddaughters are alive, and that I can help them to come here, to Sweden."""
Obituary (Obit),2008-01-04,"Bert Bolin, a pioneering climatologist and the first chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore for their warnings about global warming, died Sunday in Stockholm. He was 82.",https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/04/obituaries/04bolin.html,690," Bert Bolin, a pioneering climatologist and the first chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore for their warnings about global warming, died Sunday in Stockholm. He was 82. The cause was stomach cancer, Henning Rodhe, a chemistry professor and colleague of Dr. Bolin at Stockholm University, told Agence France-Presse. Professor Rodhe said Dr. Bolin (pronounced bo-LEEN) ""was thrilled"" that the United Nations panel had shared the Nobel Peace Prize. ""He was supposed to have gone to Oslo to accept the prize, but was too sick,"" Professor Rodhe said. Last month, while visiting Sweden, Mr. Gore told Dr. Bolin in a written statement: ""Bert, you set up the framework for the I.P.C.C. and without your contributions we would not have come to where we are today. Thank you for starting the process."" Dr. Bolin traveled to Washington in May 1959 and, according to The New York Times, told the National Academy of Sciences that a 25 percent increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere during the 150-year period ending in 2000 could be expected. Carbon dioxide, he said then, was the cause of a warming trend of two to three degrees in the previous 50 years. He was chairman of the United Nations panel from 1988 to 1997 and, with scientific expertise and acquired diplomatic skills, shepherded the panel through the first two of its influential climatological assessment reports. ""You're dealing with people from all countries, all perspectives, all different points of view; people who are strongly attached to particular ideas,"" Dan Reifsnyder, the State Department's deputy assistant secretary for environment and sustainable development, said Thursday. ""Somehow Bert got this group to work together to produce objective scientific and technical reports that come very close to policy."" The panel, created in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization, brought together 3,500 scientists from around the world and set them in three working groups. One examines atmospheric chemistry and greenhouse gas emissions. The second deals with the impacts of various degrees of climate change. The third researches the possibilities for mitigation. The concerns expressed in the first of the two assessments issued during Dr. Bolin's chairmanship, in August 1990, led to the drafting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the first international document bringing nations together to deal with the issue. The framework, first promoted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro 1992, has 192 signatories, including the United States. The second assessment issued during Dr. Bolin's tenure, in 1995, led to the Kyoto Protocol, which called on industrialized countries to collectively limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. The United States signed the protocol in 1998, but the document has never been sent to the Senate for its consent. ""Bert was responsible for helping to assure that the I.P.C.C. remained an objective scientific and technical body,"" said Mr. Reifsnyder, who worked with Dr. Bolin for many years. Bert Richard Johannes Bolin was born in Nykoping, Sweden, on May 15, 1925. He graduated from the Uppsala University in 1946. He earned a master's degree in 1949 and a doctorate in 1956, both in meteorology, at Stockholm University. He was hired as an associate professor there and remained on the faculty until 1990. Dr. Bolin's marriage to Ulla Frykstrand ended in divorce in 1979. His survivors include three children: Dan, Karina and Goran. Early in his career, Dr. Bolin began researching what is called the carbon cycle. ""It's sort of a big Ferris wheel that circulates carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, the oceans and plant life after it is emitted by humans, or naturally,"" said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton. ""Bolin did fundamental work toward modern understanding of the state of carbon dioxide emissions."" He also contributed, Dr. Oppenheimer said, toward determining how much extra carbon dioxide results from deforestation. But his greatest achievement, Dr. Oppenheimer said, may have been ""as a scientific statesman."""
News,2011-01-11,"LONDON  Lawyers for Julian Assange, the founder of the WikiLeaks antisecrecy group, said on Tuesday that they would oppose his extradition to Sweden because he might subsequently face “illegal rendition” to the United States, risking imprisonment at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, or even the death penalty.",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/world/europe/12assange.html,966," LONDON — Lawyers for Julian Assange, the founder of the WikiLeaks antisecrecy group, said on Tuesday that they would oppose his extradition to Sweden because he might subsequently face ""illegal rendition"" to the United States, risking imprisonment at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, or even the death penalty. They made the assertion in defense documents released after Mr. Assange made a brief appearance in a British high-security court for a largely procedural hearing concerning his resistance to demands for his extradition to Sweden, where he has been accused of sexual misconduct. The documents for the first time publicly named the two WikiLeaks volunteers who have accused Mr. Assange of forcing them to have sex with him without a condom in Sweden last August, in one case while the woman was asleep. In keeping with Sweden's policy of anonymity for those involved in such cases, they had been referred to only as Ms. A and Ms. W. Karin Rosander, a spokeswoman for the Swedish prosecutors' office, could not immediately say whether the disclosure of the women's names was a crime, but she said that possibility would be investigated. Jennifer Robinson, one of Mr. Assange's London lawyers, said that the inclusion of the women's names in the defense documents was an oversight that would be corrected. The court scheduled the extradition hearing for Feb. 7-8. The sexual accusations, which Mr. Assange denies, have overlapped with the WikiLeaks publication of about 2,000 State Department documents — from a trove of about 250,000 in its possession — exposing confidential or secret communications to broad scrutiny on its Web site and in publications including The New York Times, The Guardian in Britain, Der Spiegel in Germany, Le Monde in France and El País in Spain. ""Our work with WikiLeaks continues unabated, and we are stepping up our publishing for matters relating to Cablegate and other materials,"" Mr. Assange said after the 10-minute hearing, using his group's term for the State Department documents. ""Those will shortly be appearing through our newspaper partners throughout the world,"" he said, without elaborating on the content. In recent weeks, the flow of documents has slowed to a trickle. Mr. Assange was jailed in Britain in early December after a Swedish prosecutor issued a European arrest warrant seeking his extradition to be questioned about the sexual accusations. He was released on $370,000 bail nine days later, on Dec. 16. In a 35-page outline of their case against extradition, released on the WikiLeaks Web site, Mr. Assange's lawyers said, ""It is submitted that there is a real risk that, if extradited to Sweden, the United States will seek his extradition and/or illegal rendition to the U.S.A., where there will be a real risk of him being detained at Guantánamo Bay or elsewhere."" The document also cited statements by calling for the execution of those who leaked the State Department documents. ""Indeed, if Mr. Assange were rendered to the U.S.A. without assurances that the death penalty would not be carried out, there is a real risk that he could be made subject to the death penalty,"" the lawyers said. Mr. Assange's lawyers released their outline within minutes of the court hearing. They said they would also argue that Swedish law did not permit their client to be extradited on ""the mere suspicion"" that he had committed a crime. The lawyers argued that Swedish prosecutors had said publicly that they were seeking his extradition solely to question him about the sexual misconduct accusations. The defense said Mr. Assange had been ""the victim of a pattern of illegal or corrupt behavior"" by Swedish prosecutors, whom they accused of making a series of procedural and other errors in their handling of the case. Previous hearings have been held in central London courts. But the one on Tuesday was set for the Belmarsh high-security court in the southeast of the city, which often handles terrorism cases. Britain's court service said the move was intended to accommodate reporters and camera crews who had scrimmaged for position at the other courts. Wearing a gray duffle coat over a dark suit and tie, Mr. Assange arrived with his British lawyer, Mark Stephens. Once in court, he gave a thumbs-up to associates in the public gallery. The WikiLeaks disclosures have angered officials in Washington, and Justice Department officials are seeking to determine whether they can bring charges against him. Prosecutors have gone to court to demand Twitter account records of several people linked to WikiLeaks, including Mr. Assange, according to the group and a copy of a subpoena made public on Friday. The subpoena is the first public evidence of a criminal investigation, announced last month by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., that has been urged by members of Congress from both parties but is fraught with legal and political difficulties for the Obama administration. It was denounced by WikiLeaks, which has so far made public only about 1 percent of the quarter-million diplomatic cables in its possession. It has threatened to post them all on the Web if criminal charges are brought. When Mr. Assange, a 39-year-old Australian, was released from jail last month, his bail conditions required him to stay in Ellingham Hall, a luxurious house on a 650-acre estate in eastern England; wear an electronic tag; and report to local police officers every day. He has described the conditions as ""high-tech house arrest."" He recently said he had signed deals to publish an autobiography that, he told a British newspaper, might be worth $1.7 million. On Tuesday, the court agreed to allow him to move to central London for two days during the full extradition hearing next month. He will be staying at the Frontline Club, founded by Vaughan Smith, the owner of Ellingham Hall."
News,2011-01-31,STOCKHOLM  Martin Cervall believes that his grandfather was on the cutting edge of a contemporary trend in Sweden.,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/world/europe/01stockholm.html,1077," STOCKHOLM — Martin Cervall believes that his grandfather was on the cutting edge of a contemporary trend in Sweden. These days, growing numbers of young Swedes about to marry are not only choosing flatware patterns but also picking new names. Sometimes it is an older family name; more often it is one they simply concoct. Sofia Wetterlund, 29, was born Sofia Jönsson, and when she decided to marry last year, she and her spouse-to-be, Karl Andersson, were simply tired of their names. ""We both thought Andersson and Jönsson were very common,"" she said. ""Karl wanted something different, I wanted something different. We just didn't want to be taken for the others."" The couple cast about in their families' past and Ms. Wetterlund discovered, well, Wetterlund, her grandmother's maiden name. ""We thought it was pretty, and it was quite uncommon,"" she said. Additionally, ""Wetterlund"" was in danger of extinction, at least in their family; only one  relative still bore the name. So they asked government officials for permission to be called Wetterlund, and permission was granted. In most cases, couples adopt a new name for the same reasons the Wetterlunds did: to rebel against the hegemony of traditional Swedish surnames ending in ""-son"" — Johansson, Andersson and Karlsson being the most common. And it does not end there. Of the 100 most common names here, 42 end in ""-son."" Sweden abounds in names ending in ""-son"" because of an old Nordic practice, before hereditary surnames were introduced, of using the father's first name, and the suffix ""-son"" for a son, or ""-dotter"" for a daughter. So Lars, the son of Karl, was named Lars Karlsson; a daughter Lisbet became Lisbet Karlsdotter, though she would lose this at marriage. (The  practice still exists in Iceland.) While some Swedes like Ms. Wetterlund rummage through family history for a new name, others simply invent one. Some take names with a Mediterranean flair, like Andriano and Bovino, said Eva Brylla, the director of research at the Institute of Language and Folklore in Uppsala. Others adopt English-sounding names, like Swedenrose or Flowerland; others let their imaginations fly, simply using building blocks common in Swedish names and fashioning tongue twisters like Shirazimohager and Rowshanravan. The government, which must approve all name changes, places certain names off limits. Trademarks, like Coke, are out, as are obscenities. Names of nobility, like Bernadotte, the family name of the Swedish king, are not allowed, nor are names of celebrities. Obama is also off limits, said Jan Ekengren, director of the Patent and Registration Office, which oversees name changes. And Donadoni, the name of an Italian soccer star, was rejected. All of this strikes a familiar chord for Mr. Cervall, 44, a management consultant, though the history of name changes in his family goes way back.  His paternal grandfather was  Bertil Carlsson, and his brother, Vallentin Carlsson. So in 1927 the brothers, wanting to shed the ""-son"" and feeling inventive, took the first syllables of Bertil and Vallentin to form the surname Bervall. That did not sound quite right, so they replaced the B with a C to get Cervall, then  got permission to take it as their surname. So Mr. Cervall and his children are all Cervalls. But his sister married an Olsson, and her son,  chafing under his surname,  received permission at age 18 to be called Cervall, too. ""He wanted to be different,"" Mr. Cervall said. Ms. Brylla of the Language and Folklore Institute, who is a consultant to the Patent and Registration Office, said the practice of changing names had been around for more than a century in Sweden as people sought to escape their ""-son"" names. But in recent years, the trickle of name changing became a flood. Partly, Ms. Brylla said, this was a result of new legislation. Under the old laws, only those with surnames ending in ""-son"" or having embarrassing connotations could change their names. But a law enacted in 1982 permits almost anyone to do so, for almost any reason. ""Since 1982, the number of name changes has increased each year,"" Mr. Ekengren, the patent office director, said. ""The number has doubled since 2002."" Last year, there were 7,257 name changes, a slight drop from 2009, he said, probably because of the  economic crisis and a 20 percent increase in the fee for a name change, which is now $270. ""The reason for most changes is you want to stand out, be individual,"" Mr. Ekengren said. ""Olla Andersson meets Eric Svensson — they want to start something together."" That was pretty much the way it was a decade ago when Magnus Karlsson met Anna Lindstedt, and decided to marry. ""She did not want Karlsson, and I didn't want Lindstedt,"" said the former Mr. Karlsson, who is now Magnus Pantzar. ""When I was born, 7 of 10 people had '-son' names."" The couple rummaged around their families' histories and found the name of Mr. Karlsson's maternal grandmother, Pantzar.  The marriage ended in divorce after 11 months, but the name Pantzar stuck. ""I kind of liked the name,"" said Mr. Pantzar, 43. ""People know me as Pantzar."" With his current partner, Mr. Pantzar has two daughters, who are also Pantzars. Older family members remark how he resembles Great-Grandfather Pantzar. ""They say it's good you took that name Pantzar,"" he said. Still, like some Swedes, he sees a possible downside. One of his brothers took the name Winberg, while the other, Thomas, kept the family name, Karlsson, so the three brothers have three different names. ""Thomas will sometimes wink at my father and say, 'I'm the son that kept your name,' "" Mr. Pantzar said. But he added: ""In this age of globalization, we need to stick with our traditions. In that, it's nice to have Swedish names."" Others share no such qualms. Viggo Johansen, 44, an asset manager, has kept his name but has no objections to the name-changing practice. ""If you want to create something new, why not?"" he said. ""I hope we have more culture and history to rely on than just our names."" Indeed, support for Swedish names is coming from an unexpected quarter. In recent decades, successive waves of immigrants have been coming to Sweden, and many avail themselves of the laws and take Swedish-sounding names to hasten their integration. Mr. Ekengren recalled a case a few years ago in which an immigrant family requested permission to be called Mohammedsson. ""Permission was granted,"" he said."
