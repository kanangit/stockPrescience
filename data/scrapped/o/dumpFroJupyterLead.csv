It will operate under the supreme command of the Finnish General Staff. Otherwise, it will resemble a private army. They are here to fight for a small country with a population about half that of the City of New York, into which a powerful neighbor has sent its armies and air force. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Jan. 17, 1940",https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/16/1940-thousands-join-finnish-army/,186
