Review,2018-11-02,CAPITALISM IN AMERICA A History By Alan Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge Illustrated. 486 pp. Penguin. $35.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/books/review/alan-greenspan-capitalism-in-america-adrian-wooldridge.html,1293," CAPITALISM IN AMERICA A History By Alan Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge Illustrated. 486 pp. Penguin. $35. At age 92, Alan Greenspan remains a towering figure in American finance. He was the second-longest serving chairman of the Federal Reserve (after William McChesney Martin). Dubbed a ""rock star"" by The Economist, Greenspan achieved an unprecedented level of celebrity for a Fed chairman as stocks soared to record levels in the 1990s, and then notoriety, as his legacy was undermined by the Great Recession that began in 2008, less than two years after he left office. Greenspan was appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1987 and reappointed by three successive presidents from both parties. That a lifelong champion of free markets and an early acolyte of the objectivist author and philosopher Ayn Rand could so successfully straddle the political spectrum for so long is a testament to the bipartisan free-market ideology that followed the end of the Cold War. At the time it all seemed like the ultimate triumph of democratic capitalism. Now, 10 years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers provoked a global financial panic and led to what Greenspan refers to as ""the great stagnation,"" the self-congratulation seems to have been premature. Both parties have largely repudiated Greenspan's precepts, with Republicans lurching toward protectionism and a nativist hostility for globalization and Democrats lurching toward something he would surely find equally repugnant: income redistribution, ever-expanding government entitlements and identity politics. Less a conventional history than an extended polemic, ""Capitalism in America: A History,"" by Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge, a columnist and editor for The Economist, explores and ultimately celebrates the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter's concept of ""creative destruction,"" which the authors describe as a ""perennial gale"" that ""uproots businesses — and lives — but that, in the process, creates a more productive economy."" While this approach risks oversimplifying centuries of American economic history, it provides a useful lens for analyzing America's current polarization and for understanding the centrifugal forces that have given rise to a President Trump, on the right, or a Bernie Sanders on the left. Other than a few paragraphs arguing the case that the Fed's easy money policy had little to no impact on the housing bubble that led to the Great Recession, ""Capitalism in America"" has almost nothing to say about Greenspan's own role in recent economic history, and he offers no defense of his tenure as Fed chairman. But that isn't his purpose here. ""Capitalism in America"" is Greenspan and Wooldridge's plea to re-embrace America's long-held capitalist traditions and entrepreneurial culture in order to rescue the country from its current ""fading dynamism."" While ""Capitalism in America"" begins with the colonial era, when Americans were already enjoying ""the world's fastest growth rate,"" Greenspan and Wooldridge hit their narrative stride and ideological sweet spot when they reach the late-19th-century ""Age of Giants,"" a name they prefer to the prevailing ""Robber Barons,"" who may have been rich but, as self-made men, were neither robbers nor hereditary barons. In the authors' approving view, men like the banker John Pierpont Morgan, the oil baron John D. Rockefeller and the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, all born within a few years of one another in the 1830s, were ""giants of energy and ambition"" who ""exercised more power than anybody other than kings or generals had exercised before."" These men (and they were all men) are ""heroes of creative destruction"" because they ""helped to produce a massive improvement in living standards for all."" That they also produced social and economic upheaval for many is a small price to pay, the authors contend. The rise of their great corporations, not to mention the industries they helped build and finance, from railroads to autos to retail chains like Sears, Roebuck, displaced millions of workers and small-business owners who were rendered obsolete. Cyrus McCormack's threshing machine displaced a quarter of the world's agricultural workers. ""People seldom achieve great things without being willing to ride roughshod over the opposition,"" the authors note. Not surprisingly, these ""giants"" attracted popular hostility and resentment — Teddy Roosevelt called them ""malefactors of great wealth."" Their success and attendant wealth unleashed a populist backlash. Williams Jennings Bryan campaigned against Wall Street and its ""cross of gold."" Congress passed the first antitrust laws. The first federal income tax paved the way to income redistribution. History's harsh judgment of the era (which culminated in the 1929 stock market crash and ensuing Great Depression) suggests why creative destruction has had trouble gaining much of a following. Like the Robber Barons, today's drivers of creative destruction, technology and internet entrepreneurs, ""are seldom the easiest of heroes, nor the nicest,"" the authors note. ""They will sacrifice anything, from their own peace of mind to the lives of those around them, to build a business empire and then protect that business empire from destruction."" Such people are prone ""to what the Norwegians call Stormannsgalskap, or the 'madness of great men.'"" Tesla's Elon Musk, who merits several approving mentions, comes to mind. The disruptive forces they unleash generate ""unease: the fiercer the gale the greater the unease."" And not all destruction, it should be said, is creative. In a nod to the exotic derivatives and mortgage-backed securities that led to the Great Recession (and went largely undetected by Greenspan's Fed), Greenspan and Wooldridge acknowledge that ""creative destruction can sometimes be all destruction and no creation."" The popular reaction is typically a well-intentioned but misguided effort to preserve the status quo. ""People link arms to protect threatened jobs and save dying industries. They denounce capitalists for their ruthless greed. The result is stagnation: In trying to tame the creative destruction, for example by preserving jobs or keeping factories open, they end up killing it,"" the authors contend. In their view, America today is already well along that path to stagnation. ""Capitalism in America"" barely mentions Trump beyond condemning his ""dangerous"" trade policies and warning about the fiscal recklessness of his tax cuts. But the entire book is an indictment of Trump's stands on immigration and protectionism and his attempts to resurrect fading mining and industrial concerns — attempts that, as ""Capitalism in America"" shows repeatedly, are almost surely doomed. At the same time, Greenspan's admiration for the rugged individualists who populate the novels of Ayn Rand (who merits a nod in this history) and the frontier spirit that animated America's early development shows no sign of weakening as Greenspan has aged. He and Wooldridge lament that Americans are ""losing the rugged pioneering spirit"" that once defined them and mock the ""trigger warnings"" and ""safe spaces"" that now obsess academia. The authors quote Winston Churchill: ""We have not journeyed across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy."" But now, they conclude, ""sugar candy people are everywhere."" Their prescription for American renewal — reining in entitlements, instituting fiscal responsibility and limited government, deregulating, focusing on education and opportunity, and above all fostering a fierceness in the face of creative destruction — was Republican orthodoxy not so long ago. Before the Great Recession it was embraced by most Democrats as well, and more recently by President Bill Clinton, the recipient of glowing praise in these pages. No longer. ""Capitalism in America,"" in both its interpretation of economic history and its recipe for revival, is likely to offend the dominant Trump wing of the Republican Party and the resurgent left among Democrats. It's not clear who, if anyone, will pick up the Greenspan torch. America is now ""trapped in an iron cage of its own making,"" the authors contend. But ""we have shown that America has all the keys that it needs to open the cage. The great question is whether it has the political will to turn them."""
News,2018-11-02,The last official snapshot of the economy before Americans vote on Tuesday offered another reminder of the labor market’s persistent strength. Hiring is up. Wages are up. The total number of workers and job searchers is up.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/business/economy/jobs-report.html,1378," The last official snapshot of the economy before Americans vote on Tuesday offered another reminder of the labor market's persistent strength. Hiring is up. Wages are up. The total number of workers and job searchers is up. ""It's really the strongest part of the broader economy at the moment,"" Michelle Girard, chief United States economist at NatWest Markets, said of the labor market. A swerving stock market, tariffs and weakening growth in other countries may be causing agita, but they have done little to dent economic momentum in the United States. Employers added 250,000 jobs in October, extending a record streak of growth to 97 months, the Labor Department reported on Friday. The economy has historically not played an outsize role in midterm elections, and this political season, border control, health care and Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court have gobbled up airtime and political ad space. Still, about three-quarters of registered voters say the economy is ""very important"" in determining their vote, according to polls conducted by the Pew Research Center. Among Republicans, that number is even higher at 85 percent. ""Jobs and the economy"" was also cited more frequently than other issues as the most important in a survey conducted in early October for The New York Times by the online research platform SurveyMonkey. A recent string of reports suggests both are in good shape. Last week, the government estimated that the economy grew at a hearty annualized rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter. Confidence remains high among consumers and business leaders. Over the past year, employers have added an average of 210,000 jobs a month. Friday's roundup also offered evidence that sidelined workers are not only feeling optimistic about job prospects but are actually finding work, which is why the jobless rate was unchanged at 3.7 percent even as employers hired more people. An estimated 711,000 people joined the labor force last month. President Trump, on Friday, called the numbers ""tremendous."" A modest monthly wage gain of 0.2 percent nonetheless produced a surprisingly big 3.1 percent jump in annual growth. That was partly because of an unusual drop in pay in October last year after hurricanes. Yet even if the year-over-year increase was somewhat inflated, the underlying trends point to a pickup in wage growth. Some analysts saw warnings of inflation, but others said the pay increase should not bother policymakers at the Federal Reserve. ""I don't think it's something the Fed should worry about,"" Ms. Girard said. ""Productivity growth is picking up, and workers should earn more. It doesn't mean companies have to pass on higher wage costs to consumers. They can afford to pay them more."" The Fed, which has increased rates three times this year from historically low levels, is expected to raise them again to 2.5 percent in December as a hedge against inflation. Mr. Trump has called the Fed ""loco"" and ""out of control"" for raising interest rates, and blamed it for the recent drop in stock prices and for potentially derailing the economy. In a call with reporters, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, cited productivity growth as the explanation for higher wages, and not an overheating economy. He also took the opportunity to say that the president respects the Fed's independence. As always, the monthly jobs report captures only a particular moment; the underlying trend is what's important. That caution is particularly pertinent this time. The back-to-back hurricanes in September and October may have distorted the data in unpredictable ways. ""It looks good, but it's never happened before when you have hurricanes making landfall in successive survey weeks,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Manufacturing jobs — which have traditionally paid well and have been a focus of Mr. Trump's policies — increased by a healthy 32,000. Here, too, Mr. Shepherdson advised skepticism, noting that the Institute for Supply Management reported this week that its manufacturing index had fallen to a six-month low amid worries about tariffs, shortages of parts and a drop in global demand. ""If I were a Republican politician, I would be shouting about it,"" Mr. Shepherdson said, referring to manufacturing. ""But there's no way that growth is going to continue."" Manufacturing sectors in China, in particular, and Europe are weakening sharply. Producers, he said, are worried about ""tariffs, tariffs, tariffs."" October's figures will be revised twice more, and September's once more. Although the unemployment rate has consistently surfed below the levels reached in 2000, at the height of that expansion, wages have been growing at significantly slower rates. Low wages in many sectors have contributed to financial instability. More than a quarter of Americans don't earn enough to cover basic expenses, while more than a third are unable to pay all their bills on time, according to a report released Thursday by the Center for Financial Services Innovation, which is funded by nonprofit foundations and several banks. That shortfall has contributed to mounting credit card debt and loan defaults. October's report, however, is among several recent signs that wage growth is gathering steam. According to a report last week from the research arm of the payroll processing firm ADP, American workers are earning nearly $1 more per hour on average than they were a year ago. Protolabs, a digital manufacturing company based in Minnesota, hired 50 people last month, bringing the year's total to 340, a pace it expects to match in 2019, said Renee Conklin, vice president for human resources. But the competition for workers is becoming stiffer. ""We're seeing more employers making counteroffers to retain people,"" Ms. Conklin said. Since the recession ended, analysts have struggled to understand how many more potential workers are out there. Before the financial crisis, more than 66 percent of the population 16 or older was working or looking for a job. In recent years, that number — the labor-force participation rate — has rarely risen above 63 percent. Many of those missing workers will never rejoin the labor force — some have reached retirement age, others have seen their skills lose value, and a number are too disabled to work. Economists continue to argue about how many more people could be lured back to the labor market. Rising wages are certainly one attraction. Women are coming back into the work force at a much faster rate than men, however. And over the past year, a net total of 1.4 million women have joined compared with 845,000 men. Drawing in even more women would require better child care, paid parental leave and more flexible hours, said Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan. ""We know what to do for women,"" she said. ""We're really at a loss as to what to do to induce more men back."" Job opportunities are also rippling out to groups that were largely bypassed during much of the recovery: African-Americans, Hispanics, less-educated workers and people with disabilities have all seen their unemployment rates drop in recent months. Employers say they are constantly on the hunt for workers. ""I speak to probably a thousand businesspeople a month,"" said Rick Lazio, a former Republican congressman who is a senior vice president at Alliantgroup, a tax-credit consulting firm. Midsize manufacturers are turning down lots of business, he said, ""because they can't find the people and they can't get the equipment fast enough."" Help is not coming from abroad: The number of immigrant visas issued by the government has declined for two years in a row. Worries about fierce competition for holiday hiring have prompted employers to be more aggressive, putting offers out earlier than usual and raising wages, recruiters said. United Parcel Service has said it plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers. Several applicants for packing or delivery positions who showed up at the company's hulking customer center in Manhattan during a recent nationwide hiring drive said they hoped temporary stints would turn into permanent jobs. A company spokesman said holiday positions paid $10.35 to $30 an hour, depending on the location. ""I'm just praying,"" said Chanique Cox, 42, who did not finish high school. She knocked her knuckles on a wooden counter and clicked her blue nails. ""I'm only finding temporary jobs. I would love it if I got a permanent job."""
News,2018-11-02,"SAN FRANCISCO — Over the last year, Charlie Shrem, a 28-year-old Bitcoin investor, has bought two Maseratis, two powerboats — one of them 32 feet long — and a $2 million house in Florida, along with smaller pieces of real estate.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/technology/bitcoin-charlie-shrem-winklevoss-twins.html,1151," SAN FRANCISCO — Over the last year, Charlie Shrem, a 28-year-old Bitcoin investor, has bought two Maseratis, two powerboats — one of them 32 feet long — and a $2 million house in Florida, along with smaller pieces of real estate. In the world of cryptocurrencies, where millions can be made and lost in a day, that might not make Mr. Shrem stand out. But unlike most Bitcoin entrepreneurs, in 2016 Mr. Shrem got out of prison, where he spent a year after pleading guilty to illegally helping people turn dollars into Bitcoin to buy drugs online. Mr. Shrem, who had been the chief executive of Bitinstant, one of the first prominent Bitcoin businesses in the United States, has said in recent interviews that he went to prison with almost no money. So where did the money for the expensive toys come from? That's what two former business partners want to know. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twins who turned money from a settlement with Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg into a Bitcoin fortune, said they suspected Mr. Shrem had actually been spending Bitcoin that he owed them since 2012, according to a lawsuit unsealed in federal court on Thursday. The Bitcoin would be worth around $32 million at current prices. ""Either Shrem has been incredibly lucky and successful since leaving prison, or — more likely — he 'acquired' his six properties, two Maseratis, two powerboats and other holdings with the appreciated value of the 5,000 Bitcoin he stole from"" the Winklevoss twins in 2012, the lawsuit says. The judge who oversaw Mr. Shrem's earlier trial has already agreed to freeze some of Mr. Shrem's financial assets, according to court documents. The lawsuit could blossom into an ever bigger problem for Mr. Shrem because an affidavit filed in court suggests that Mr. Shrem has also not paid the government $950,000 in restitution that he agreed to as part of his 2014 guilty plea. Mr. Shrem's lawyer, Brian Klein, said in a statement that the claims by the Winklevoss brothers were baseless. ""The lawsuit erroneously alleges that about six years ago Charlie essentially misappropriated thousands of Bitcoins,"" he said. ""Nothing could be further from the truth. Charlie plans to vigorously defend himself and quickly clear his name."". The lawsuit from the twins threatens another reversal of fortune for Mr. Shrem, who went from being one of the earliest Bitcoin millionaires to being called Bitcoin's ""first felon."" When he was arrested in 2014, Mr. Shrem was accused by federal authorities of using his company, Bitinstant, to knowingly sell Bitcoin to people who wanted it to buy drugs from the online black market, Silk Road. Since his release in 2016, Mr. Shrem has said in numerous interviews that he recognizes his past mistakes and wants to cut a new and legal path. On the podcast ""Death, Sex and Money,"" Mr. Shrem said that in the first months out of prison, he worked as a dishwasher and didn't look at his email. Over the last year, though, Mr. Shrem has already gotten involved with a number of troubled projects. He was among the leaders of two efforts — one a cryptocurrency credit card and the other an initial coin offering — that had to give money back to investors after various partnerships that Mr. Shrem had promised fell through. But those are likely to be mere headaches compared with what he could face in a confrontation with the Winklevoss twins. Mr. Shrem helped get the brothers interested in Bitcoin in 2012 and became their first adviser in the young industry. The twins asked Mr. Shrem to help them amass the beginnings of what would become an enormous stockpile of cryptocurrencies, giving him $750,000 to buy Bitcoin from other deep-pocketed investors. A few months into this partnership, the twins said, they realized that Mr. Shrem had not given them all the Bitcoin they were due. The brothers gave Mr. Shrem $250,000 in September 2012, but the lawsuit says that a month later, he delivered only around $189,000 worth of Bitcoin at the going price, which was around $12.50. The 5,000 or so missing Bitcoins became a point of tension between the twins and Mr. Shrem. They asked him numerous times for an accounting of the Bitcoins he had purchased and eventually brought in an accountant who documented the missing funds, according to court documents. ""I have been patient, and at this point it's getting a bit absurd,"" Cameron Winklevoss wrote to Mr. Shrem in 2013 in an email quoted in the lawsuit. ""I don't take this lightly."" The missing Bitcoins, which were worth 98 percent less at the time, appeared to have been forgotten in a broader battle between the brothers and Mr. Shrem over an investment in Bitinstant. In 2013, Bitinstant fell apart, and the twins blocked Mr. Shrem's efforts to revive the company with new investors because of their concerns about his management style. By the time Mr. Shrem was arrested in 2014, as a result of activities at Bitinstant that took place before the brothers invested, they had cut off contact with him. The Winklevoss twins' problems with Mr. Shrem have not held them back. They were briefly each cryptocurrency billionaires last year, and they have built one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Gemini. Despite this year's big drop in cryptocurrency prices, their holdings are still worth nearly a billion dollars. Cameron Winklevoss said that he and his brother decided to pursue the missing Bitcoins again after they saw Mr. Shrem's recent spending patterns. ""When he purchased $4 million in real estate, two Maseratis and two powerboats, we decided it was time to get to the bottom of it,"" Mr. Winklevoss told The New York Times. The brothers hired an investigator, who found that 5,000 Bitcoins were transferred in 2013 through addresses associated with Mr. Shrem and onto the Bitcoin wallet services Xapo and Coinbase, according to the complaint. The investigator traced the money on the blockchain, the public ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Jed S. Rakoff, a judge in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, approved an application the twins made in September to freeze any funds that Mr. Shrem holds with those companies. Judge Rakoff wrote in his order that Mr. Shrem had ""evidenced an intent to frustrate the collection efforts of his creditors."" The court fight could cause problems for Mr. Shrem's latest venture, Crypto.IQ. The company, which promises market intelligence to Bitcoin traders, is holding a conference for customers in Las Vegas this month promising ""unparalleled insights from a roster of experts at the very epicenter of the crypto universe."" In an interview with Breaker magazine in September, Mr. Shrem said he was getting used to the ups and downs. ""My personal life goes through bull and bear markets, too,"" he said. ""So the key is how to deal with it when you're in the bear markets."""

News,2018-11-02,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — When a Republican state legislator in Arkansas pushed last year to rename the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport in Little Rock, Clarke Tucker stood up for the former president.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/us/politics/bill-clinton-elections-democrats.html,1634," LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — When a Republican state legislator in Arkansas pushed last year to rename the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport in Little Rock, Clarke Tucker stood up for the former president. ""The argument was that the people of Arkansas don't support the Clintons,"" said Mr. Tucker, a Democratic member of the state House of Representatives. ""My thought at the time was, well, the people of Arkansas voted for Clinton eight times."" But now, as the Democratic nominee in the tightest congressional race in this state, Mr. Tucker is happy for the former president and his wife to remain a plane ride away. Mr. Clinton, who was governor and attorney general of Arkansas, was once a near-ubiquitous presence helping Democrats in tough races back home, but the former president hasn't been asked to appear on the trail for Mr. Tucker. There are no plans for him to do so. Or, for that matter, appear publicly with any Democrat running in the midterm elections. ""Every election is about the future,"" Mr. Tucker said, as he drove to a campaign fund-raiser in Little Rock. As Democrats search for their identity in the Trump era, one aspect has become strikingly clear: Mr. Clinton is not part of it. Just days before the midterm elections, Mr. Clinton finds himself in a kind of political purgatory, unable to overcome past personal and policy choices now considered anathema within the rising liberal wing of his party. The former president, once such a popular political draw that he was nicknamed his party's ""explainer-in-chief,"" has only appeared at a handful of private fund-raisers to benefit midterm candidates, according to people close to him. He added one more last week, headlining a Wednesday evening fund-raiser in New York City last week to benefit the campaign of Mike Espy, Mr. Clinton's former agriculture secretary who is running for Senate in Mississippi. Mr. Espy's campaign declined to comment on the event. The absence of Mr. Clinton is a notable shift both for a man who's boosted Democratic candidates in every election for the past half century and for a party long defined by the former first couple. Hillary Clinton has slowly become a more visible presence in the 2018 election, even seeming to crack open the door to another presidential bid in an interview last week, but she is also a frequent Republican target and a burden to Democrats in some parts of the country. In an election shaped by the #MeToo movement, where female candidates and voters are likely to drive any Democratic gains, Mr. Clinton finds his legacy tarnished by what some in the party see as his inability to reckon with his sexual indiscretions as president with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, as well as with past allegations of sexual assault. (Mr. Clinton has denied those allegations.) Younger and more liberal voters find little appeal in Mr. Clinton's reputation for ideological centrism on issues like financial regulation and crime. ""I'm not sure that with all the issues he has, he could really be that helpful to the candidates,"" said Tamika D. Mallory, an organizer of the Women's March, who's now promoting female candidates across the country. ""It would do the Democratic Party well to have Bill Clinton focus on his humanitarian efforts."" Rebecca Kirszner Katz, a veteran Democratic strategist, says many Democrats have reassessed the party's support for Clinton's behavior in light of changing views about women, power and sexual misconduct. ""It was an abuse of power that shouldn't have happened and if the Clintons can't accept that fact 20 years later, it's hard to see how they can be part of the future of the Democratic Party,"" said Ms. Katz, who worked as a top strategist on Cynthia Nixon's bid to unseat Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York this year. Mr. Clinton, 72, currently chairs the board of the Clinton Foundation, helping to promote and manage the philanthropic organization he founded after leaving the White House. Angel Ureña, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton, said the former president believes ""this election should be about these times and these candidates."" ""President Clinton is encouraged by the large number of impressive Democrats running for office who are personally telling their stories and laying out their vision for how to get America back on track,"" he said. ""They are the people voters need to hear from."" The uneasiness around Mr. Clinton may serve as a warning sign for others considering their political futures in the party. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, has been struggling to address his role leading the 1991 Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings. Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, recently drew criticism for questioning the #MeToo movement. Several party strategists who have been in discussions with Democrats weighing presidential bids suggested that reckoning with Mr. Clinton's legacy could become a litmus test in the 2020 primary race, with candidates being asked whether he should have resigned after the affair became public. The Clintons recently announced a 13-city arena tour, produced by Live Nation, guaranteeing they'll continue to be in the spotlight into the spring. Some Democrats worry the tour will become a distraction just as the party attempts to shape a national message that could effectively challenge President Trump in the presidential election. The couple still has pull, in part because of their decades-long personal relationships with so many strategists, donors and activists. Few Democrats were eager to talk publicly about Mr. Clinton's future role in the party. Though they're reluctant to say it out loud, Mr. Clinton's political exile is an open secret in Democratic circles. At a rare public appearance by Mrs. Clinton last week in South Florida to benefit Donna Shalala's House campaign, Ms. Shalala — a former Clinton administration cabinet secretary — lavished praise on the Democrats' 2016 presidential nominee, calling her ""wonder woman"" and ""one of the great political leaders of our times."" When asked whether she'd invite Mr. Clinton to come campaign for her, Ms. Shalala passed on the idea: ""He has a great political mind. I actually haven't talked to him myself."" Mr. Clinton's absence from the campaign trail is all the more striking given the number of candidates with close ties to the Clinton legacy. Beyond Mr. Espy, there's Ms. Shalala, also a former president of the Clinton Foundation, and Nancy Soderberg, a former ambassador to the United Nations and a White House national security aide under Mr. Clinton. Both are running for House seats in Florida. Former Clinton speechwriter Josh Gottheimer is running for re-election to a House seat in New Jersey. J.B. Pritzker, the Democratic nominee for governor of Illinois, is a family friend and, like a number of other candidates across the country, supported Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign. While people close to Mr. Clinton say candidates have asked for his advice privately, at least a few rejected public help. Mr. Clinton's offers to campaign last year for Ralph Northam, the governor of Virginia, were rebuffed. Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for governor of Florida, did not ask the president to campaign for him, after Mr. Clinton called with congratulations on his primary win. In August, the New Hampshire Democratic Party stripped Mr. Clinton's name from its annual fall dinner, changing it from the ""Kennedy-Clinton Dinner"" to the ""Eleanor Roosevelt Dinner."" The state party chairman, Raymond Buckley, said the new name is aimed at highlighting the party's ""steadfast commitment to electing Democratic women."" Friends of Mr. Clinton say he understands the current climate, even as he misses the campaign trail. ""It's not a time for national Democrats who are not thinking of running for president to be out on the campaign trail,"" said Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and White House aide to Mr. Clinton. ""He never stops or wants to stop but he's a very smart politician and understands the rhythms this cycle."" The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate. Still, many Democrats are mystified by what seems like the Clintons' inability to respond to questions about Mr. Clinton's past that are inevitable in the #MeToo era. Efforts to promote a thriller novel he wrote with author James Patterson were overshadowed after the former president said he would not handle the Monica Lewinsky scandal any differently today. Earlier this month, Mrs. Clinton said in a television interview that her husband's affair was not an abuse of power because Ms. Lewinsky was ""an adult."" Even in his home state, some Democrats are struggling with how to reconcile Mr. Clinton's policy achievements with his personal behavior. ""I'm not a fan of what he's said recently about #MeToo,"" said Claire Brown, 37, a Little Rock real estate agent, as she mingled with other donors at a fund-raiser for Mr. Tucker's campaign. ""But I don't think you understand the economic impact that man has had on the local economy and our state. The gratitude for that will be infinite."" Clinton supporters say concerns about Mr. Clinton's past behavior are unfair, given the numerous sexual assault allegations that have been leveraged against the current president. ""Frankly, everything is relative, so if people are upset with him in connection with the #MeToo movement all they have to do is look at Trump,"" said former Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe, who speaks regularly with Mr. Clinton. Hey, I'm Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I'll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.  As she wrangled her toddler son across the room at the fund-raiser, Jennifer Hopkinson, 35, noted that she was surprised to hear a Little Rock mayoral candidate recently cite Mr. Clinton's life as an inspiration for his political career. ""I thought it was risky,"" she said. ""That might sink his campaign right there."" Mark Baillie, 37, agreed, saying he didn't approve of Mr. Clinton's behavior but believed the allegations paled in comparison to the charges that have dogged Mr. Trump. ""It's all relative,"" he said. ""People probably are just tired of hearing about Clinton around here."""

We held our annual DealBook ""Playing for the Long Term"" conference yesterday, which featured some of the biggest newsmakers in business and policy. Here's what stood out, along with our regular Speed Read news roundup at the bottom. (Want this by email? Sign up here.) Google's C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, issued an apology of sorts as his employees held walkouts around the world to protest how the company had handled accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct. ""It's been a difficult time,"" he said yesterday. ""There's been anger and frustration within the company. We all feel it. I feel it too. At Google, we set a very high bar, and we clearly didn't live up to our expectations."" The company gave male executives accused of sexual misconduct millions of dollars in exit packages, according to an article in the NYT last week. Yesterday, Mr. Pichai said that the company had ""drawn a very hard line"" on inappropriate behavior in recent years, and that Google is now ""a different place."" But, he added, ""moments like this show we didn't always do it right."" He promised that ""there are concrete steps coming up,"" but hesitated to say that Google had a toxic culture. ""Sexual harassment is a societal problem and Google is a large company,"" he said. ""We are definitely doing our best."" The elder son of Rupert Murdoch was named chairman and C.E.O. of his family's new television business shortly after his father sold most of the empire to Walt Disney this year. Making a rare public appearance yesterday at the conference, Mr. Murdoch reflected on the family's latest round of deal making and what it could mean for its other assets. The Disney deal prompted a question about whether his father would ever sell The Wall Street Journal, which Rupert Murdoch bought in 2007 for over $5 billion. ""I never thought we'd sell the TV studio, the film studio, so who knows?"" Mr. Murdoch responded. In the next breath, he said of his father: ""He loves journalism. He loves The Wall Street Journal and what it represents."" He also defended Fox News against criticism that it's a red-state media organization. ""We program to everyone,"" he said. ""It's to the coasts, but also everywhere in between."" Padma Lakshmi believes in redemption for men brought down in the #MeToo era. But that redemption should come from genuine remorse over the impact of one's actions, Ms. Lakshmi, the host and an executive producer of ""Top Chef,"" said yesterday — and shouldn't be driven by a man's being good at a job. ""Their talent is not somehow a pass,"" she said at the conference. ""It does not exempt them from really having to be disgraced, because what they did was disgraceful."" Ms. Lakshmi, who wrote an NYT Op-Ed in September revealing that she had been raped at the age of 16, also said that ""we need to stop equating aggression and masculinity because I think that's a big part of it."" ""I would say that we're pretty compliant,"" Lloyd Blankfein, who stepped down as C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs last month (but is now senior chairman), said yesterday. He was responding to a question about federal criminal charges filed hours earlier against two former Goldman investment bankers over their role in a Malaysian government fund from which about $4 billion went missing. The bank has also been criticized for a workplace culture that could have put deals ahead of proper compliance. ""In this case, at the very least, and this part I know, one of our people lied to us and evaded our systems and our controls,"" Mr. Blankfein said. ""It's not good."" For someone who speaks often and loudly about taking a stand and doing good, Larry Fink of BlackRock spends a lot of time thinking about gray areas. Mr. Fink, the founder, chairman and C.E.O. of the world's largest asset manager, said that dropping out of Saudi Arabia's big investment conference last month was a ""hard decision."" So was the choice earlier this year to offer investment options stripped of stocks in gun manufacturers and retailers. ""These things are not black or white,"" he said yesterday at the conference. But he emphasized that his attention to social responsibility was not a passing fad. ""I certainly never did this to be in vogue,"" he said. ""We're doing this because we're being asked."" Mary Barra, the C.E.O. of General Motors, said at the conference that the company planned to roll out a ride-sharing service that would rely on autonomous vehicles next year, a development that would advance the already-heated race to bring self-driving cars to market. ""We're on track, with our rate of learning, to be able to do that next year,"" Ms. Barra said. The vehicles can currently run safely at speeds of up to about 30 miles per hour, and the service will be limited to a small geographical area, she added. Ms. Barra did not say where the service would operate, but noted that the company had been testing in San Francisco. How often does a tweet, a policy action or a statement by President Trump leave Peter Thiel in disbelief? ""It doesn't happen very often,"" he said yesterday. By many measures, Mr. Thiel has impeccable Silicon Valley credentials. But his frequent defense of Mr. Trump has set him apart from much of the tech industry. At the conference yesterday, he acknowledged that the current political environment was ""not healthy,"" but said that the country had been ""polarized since the late '60s"" and that Mr. Trump was ""not the main cause."" Mark Frissora will step down as C.E.O. of Caesars Entertainment next year. Barclays named Nigel Higgins of Rothschild as the successor to its chairman, John McFarlane. John Hammergren will retire as McKesson's C.E.O. next year. Bill McNabb will step down as Vanguard's chairman at the end of the year. He'll be replaced by the investment firm's C.E.O., Tim Buckley.

Op-Ed,2018-11-02,"Corey Lewandowski managed Donald Trump’s presidential campaign for a year, co-wrote a book about it and keeps in close touch with Trump, as we were reminded last month, when The Times reported on a physical altercation between him and John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, just outside the Oval Office.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/opinion/midterms-democrats-trump-2020.html,2165," Corey Lewandowski managed Donald Trump's presidential campaign for a year, co-wrote a book about it and keeps in close touch with Trump, as we were reminded last month, when The Times reported on a physical altercation between him and John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, just outside the Oval Office. So I figured that his thoughts about the best Democrat to take on Trump in 2020 were as germane as anybody's.  He told me that Mike Bloomberg worried him, because Bloomberg's personal wealth would spare him the distraction of fund-raising, and that Joe Biden had the right instinct when he said that if he and Trump had gone to high school together, he would have ""beat the hell out of him."" He noted that Beto O'Rourke, the Senate candidate in Texas, had impressively crossed the threshold of celebrity. Andrew Gillum, the candidate for governor in Florida, had caught lightning, too. The right Democrat would need a talent for attention and an appetite for aggression, Lewandowski said: He or she must ""be willing to go toe-to-toe with someone who I believe to be the greatest counterpuncher that politics has ever seen.""  The midterms are on Tuesday, but by Thursday they'll be ancient history. We'll turn to the next presidential election, using the Nov. 6 results as grist for arguments about who can topple Trump and how. A moderate or a progressive? An old-timer or a newcomer? A woman or a man? That part of the drill is familiar, but it will have an unfamiliar urgency, because Trump ratchets up everything, especially the stakes.  [Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni's candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.] And this time around, assuming that nothing interrupts the president's bid for a second term, there will be a host of additional questions and concerns. They're peculiar to his intentionally abrasive personality, his deliberately provocative tactics and his almost mystical domination of the media. Should his opponent join him in the mud, which is the approach that the lawyer Michael Avenatti not only recommends but models? Is it even possible to avoid such a descent? Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton apparently think not, to judge by recent public comments of theirs (""When they go low, we kick 'em,""  Holder said).  But plenty of other prominent Democrats told me that the smartest strategy is to float above the muck, because campaigns are about contrasts and many Americans are desperate for something cleaner and calmer. ""There are a lot of people who are exhausted by the daily rancor that Trump has treated the country to and by this kind of tribal politics,"" said David Axelrod, an architect of Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. He told me that O'Rourke had raised such an unprecedented sum of money and drawn such big, adoring crowds because of his insistently upbeat style. ""When there's so much cynicism and so much vitriol out there and a guy comes along and he's relentlessly the other way — earnest and positive and open — I think that's disarming, and I think that there's a lesson in that. It suggests that there's a market out there for a more unifying figure."" I happened to reconnect with O'Rourke recently in Fort Worth, Tex., and I asked him about the optimal tone for a Democrat at this juncture and about Avenatti's and Holder's repudiations of Michelle Obama's ""they go low, we go high"" credo. ""Avenatti does not represent us,"" O'Rourke told me, meaning most Democrats. ""Eric Holder — what he said — that's not where we're at."" He added that among American voters, ""there is a real concern about civility — not for the sake of manners but for the sake of the country working."" Some Democrats even believe that an eloquent summons to civility and exhortation to move beyond rank partisanship could be the winning message, because Americans increasingly grasp the peril that we're in — the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre was only the latest bloody illustration — and because Trump can't ever claim to be an agent of healing. ""It's about confronting him where he's weakest,"" said Bob Kerrey, the former senator and former Nebraska governor. ""You have to say to the audience: This country is dangerously divided and it's on the edge of something awful.""  Kerrey said that in a perfect world, a Democratic candidate would go even further than that in the primary and tell voters: ""You're going to get angry at me, because I'm going to embrace a Republican idea if it feels good. Don't expect me to be 100 percent — 100 percent may make you happy, but it won't pull this country together.""  I love the sound of that. I also suspect it's a doomed fantasy. Trump's eventual adversary confronts a daunting balancing act: He or she must be tougher than usual without being callous, mingle the right measure of pugilism with optimism, and avoid the self-examination and self-recrimination that never trap Trump. Philippe Reines, a longtime spokesman for Hillary Clinton, made that point funnily in an op-ed essay in The Washington Post in March, counseling Trump's would-be challengers: ""Don't apologize. Ever. Not over money you took from Harvey Weinstein. Not even for attacking the pope. In fact, proactively attack the pope. Your kid is a shoplifter? You're proud of them for exposing inadequate security."" But for starters, Trump's Democratic opponent must emerge. And that will be tricky in a field of prospective candidates that's about three-dozen-people large at present. ""Nobody's ever seen anything like this,"" said Jim Jordan, who initially managed John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. ""The field is so big it's duplicative. We have multiple candidates from Massachusetts. Multiple from California. Multiple Western governors. Multiple women. Multiple billionaires."" At the first debates, Jordan added, ""There's going to be a kids' table for the kids' table."" Standing out will require one nonnegotiable quality: the vividness to loosen Trump's stranglehold on the media. To that end, any serious challenger has to figure out how to tell his or her story in a riveting way. ""High emotion"" was how Naomi Burton described what a candidate should reach for. She and Nick Hayes run the Detroit firm Means of Production, which helped with the viral biographical video at the center of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's stunning rise. Hayes told me that candidates should be wary of relying on ""traditional commercials, which people are bombarded with on a daily basis."" Trump tweets to bold if bilious effect. His opponent must also bend social media to his or her will. Many Democratic politicians have been trying to do that, with varying success. O'Rourke's defense of football players who kneel during the national anthem went as viral as imaginable, and his live streaming of everyday minutiae on Facebook has been the perfect complement to his folksy, hyper-accessible brand. But Senator Cory Booker's self-described Spartacus moment during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings didn't quite pan out — his rebellion was more transparently stagy and less audacious than advertised. There's no exaggerating the hell of jostling for space at the media trough where Trump gorges to the point of bursting. He has shamelessness on his side. Look at last Tuesday: His claim that he might end birthright citizenship through an executive order became the main news story, even though he can do no such thing, almost certainly knows that and was engaged in a political stunt meant to energize the base for the midterms. Some morsels are just too delicious for journalists and pundits not to sup on. So there's pressure on a Democratic challenger not just to communicate memorably but to say memorable things — i.e., new ones. ""Candidacies need to have a level of originality and ambition,"" said Pete Buttigieg, the young mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a rising star in the Democratic Party. He stressed the policy side of this and possible discussions about ""whether guaranteed income is now right — a more novel idea like that. I think you're going to hear more people talking about constitutional amendments in a way that we really haven't since the E.R.A."" Those amendments might touch on the Electoral College, on campaign financing, on voting rights. His point — a vital one — was that mere tinkering with the tax code or amorphous job-training proposals are yawners for duller times. They pale beside a border wall and a Muslim ban. As much as possible, Trump's adversary needs to set the terms of the conversation, not react to his incessant provocations, which is what Senator Elizabeth Warren was doing with her clumsy reveal of a DNA test that suggested some Native American blood in her. I don't see eye-to-eye with the California billionaire Tom Steyer on the timing and timbre of his Need to Impeach effort, but I found myself nodding hard enough for a neck injury when he recently told me his version of the Michelle Maxim: ""When they go low, we play our game. When they go high, we play our game. When they bluster, we play our game."" It just better be a damned good game. And it better not sneer at Trump and condescend to his supporters. No baskets, please, and no deplorables. Midwesterners who voted for him won't be lured back into the Democratic fold if they're made to feel ashamed about their decision and told that they were duped. ""That would be fatal,"" said Beth Myers, a prominent Republican consultant and longtime senior adviser to Mitt Romney. She wasn't speaking as someone who wanted a strategy to dislodge Trump; she was just sizing up the situation. She noted that most of the Democrats signaling possible candidacies ""are from blue states and don't really understand the Trump phenomenon — and that is a disadvantage. In my little liberal Democratic world in Massachusetts, people seriously can't comprehend how this guy got elected president. But when you travel around the country, it's very clear."" Her liberal friends, she added, will ask her, ""How can we have let this happen?"" And she has to explain to them that ""there are a lot of people in the country who have views different from you. This is their guy. And you need to understand that before you run someone against him. Hillary Clinton couldn't even understand how this guy could be considered. That was a huge problem for her."" Axelrod made the same general point to me, and I think it's the crucial counsel. ""If Democrats are going to win in 2020, it can't be with the careless presumption that everyone who voted for Trump is a toothless, ignorant racist,"" he said, adding that voters who were still reeling from the 2008 financial collapse and voters disgusted by the paralysis on Capitol Hill ""viewed Trump as the kick in the ass that Washington needed. There has to be room for these voters, but if they're shunned and belittled for having supported him in the first place, they will just be driven further into his column."" Lewandowski and I didn't get into that, but we got into plenty else. He said that politicians with fewer years in office and shorter records often have an advantage over those with more years and longer ones: There's less to defend and explain. Obama, he noted, wasn't even midway through his first term in the Senate when he announced his presidential bid. He reminded me of how much traction Trump got by portraying himself as an outsider to Washington. A Democratic nominee who's a governor, mayor or business owner may be the way to seize that mantle. What came through most clearly in talking with him and with others — and what I've come to believe more firmly — is that if you want to beat Trump, learn from him. Heed his smartest strategic decisions. Acknowledge and incorporate a few of the qualities that admirers attribute to him and were attracted by. Be direct, blunt and consistent. ""He has the same message today that he did the day he came down the elevator at Trump Tower,"" Myers observed. ""The message discipline is incredible. He has never wavered. It's very real and very powerful."" Convey strength. More than ever voters seem to crave that, and many see it in Trump — in the steadiness that Myers mentioned, in the way he confronts cultural headwinds, in his sustained advocacy for Kavanaugh. ""The American people like a fighter,"" Lewandowski said. ""Donald Trump proved that."" Plant yourself in the Rust Belt. ""I've given this advice to two or three people who've thought about running — don't think about anything other than what you're going to say in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan,"" Kerrey told me. ""Why should people who hunt, fish and go to church trust you? What is your answer to globalism?"" Too many Democrats spend too much time trumpeting Clinton's popular-vote victory, blaming the Russians or combing the shadows for anything that absolves them of error. They dismiss Trump as an accident, a freak or a fad. It's consoling, sure. It's also an invitation to his next inauguration. I invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter.

News,2018-11-02,"SHANGHAI — China’s biggest e-commerce company is expecting rockier times ahead, a troubling sign for a vast economy that is one of the world’s most important engines of growth.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/technology/alibaba-quarterly-earnings.html,822," SHANGHAI — China's biggest e-commerce company is expecting rockier times ahead, a troubling sign for a vast economy that is one of the world's most important engines of growth. The flagging pace of economic expansion in China and the country's trade war with the United States led the Alibaba Group to cut its estimate of revenue growth for the current fiscal year, which ends in March, by around 5 percent, the shopping giant said on Friday. For the quarter that ended in September, revenue came in at $12.4 billion, a 54 percent increase from a year earlier but less than analysts had expected. ""The global economy is in a state of uncertainty,"" Daniel Zhang, Alibaba's chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. ""The U.S.-China trade tensions create increased risk of instability."" The decision to lower sales expectations was made only recently, the company's chief financial officer, Maggie Wu, said. Economic conditions deteriorated noticeably in just the past month, she said. ""Merchants are facing challenging times,"" she said. There is mounting evidence that China's economy, the world's second-largest after the United States', is slowing. But Alibaba's trimming of its sales outlook suggests the downturn is starting to affect more parts of the economy, including China's growing middle class. The Chinese government reported last month that economic output grew 6.5 percent in the latest quarter compared with the previous year, its slowest pace in nearly a decade. The country's stock markets have tumbled, and its currency has slid. Beijing has pushed to add more money to the economy and had prodded local governments to increase spending. But the mountains of debt the country accumulated to fuel past growth are tying the authorities' hands. China's shoppers have generally been able to buoy the economy through its past ups and downs, as hundreds of millions of people rose into the middle class and spent their increased earnings on cars, appliances and better-quality food. Lately, though, consumers say they are tightening their purse strings and saving more of their income. Alibaba's sales of electronics and other big-ticket items have been affected, executives said during the conference call on Friday. Shawn Yang, 27, works in finance in Shanghai. He said that distress being felt in his industry had him thinking twice about buying nonessential items like gadgets and video games. Singles Day, the annual online shopping bonanza in China, comes on Nov. 11. Last year, Mr. Yang spent nearly $600 on workout clothes, shoes, a yoga mat and a coffee machine. This year? He plans to spend less than half that amount, on jeans from Zara, two shirts for work and a bottle of moisturizer. The other dark cloud hovering over the Chinese economy has drifted in from overseas. The quarter that ended in September was the first since the Trump administration began its trade war with China. Alibaba executives have sought to reassure investors by pointing out that even if tariffs on imports make American goods more expensive, Chinese customers can still use Alibaba's platforms to buy more products made domestically or in other countries. But the effects of the tariffs are only beginning to be felt across China's $12 trillion economy. Factory activity is slowing, which could eventually result in job losses and a drop in retail spending. Washington and Beijing seem to be hunkering down for a protracted conflict, one in which disagreements about trade seem inextricable from broader questions involving geopolitical and technological dominance. For Alibaba, the timing is inopportune. Investors have already been selling off shares in technology companies on both sides of the Pacific this year. Alibaba stock, which trades in the United States, has lost around 30 percent of its value since June. Other major Chinese internet companies have fared even worse, as fears spread over a frostier regulatory environment for the country's most vibrant enterprises. Alibaba has long enjoyed an unmatched grip on how Chinese consumers shop on their phones and computers. Lately, the company has said its future depends on extending its consumer empire into the wider, nondigital world. The company now has nearly 80 of its lavish, full-service Hema supermarkets, up from 20 a year ago. Alibaba's logistics arm, Cainiao, recently opened what it called the ""largest robotic smart warehouse in China,"" in which 700 boxy droids wheel around rearranging giant shelves laden with goods. Expanding its operations offline has helped raise Alibaba's sales growth. Revenue from retail experiments like Hema jumped 151 percent in the latest quarter from a year earlier. Sales in the company's cloud-computing division, the market leader in China, soared 90 percent. But spending on developing the new ventures has squeezed the company's bottom line. Asked on Friday whether the more pessimistic outlook for this year might lead Alibaba to scale back on such projects, Ms. Wu, the chief financial officer, said the company evaluated them not on their financial return, but according to other metrics, such as the number of users they attract."

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Greetings from sunny San Francisco. I'm Nathaniel Popper, a Times reporter covering financial technology and strange things like Bitcoin and the blockchain. I wrote a story this week about a crazy scheme to build a blockchain-based community in the Nevada desert. But I couldn't help spending much of the week riveted by the work my colleagues were doing. A few years ago, an Apple product introduction, which was covered this week by Jack Nicas, or the quarterly earnings announcements of the big companies, might have been the thing everyone was talking about. And in more ordinary times, the biggest news in Silicon Valley would have been the fallout from the article that my colleagues Daisuke Wakabayashi and Katie Benner published last week about Google and its handling of sexual harassment. Thousands of Google employees walked out of work on Thursday to protest the company's policies and decision-making. Earlier in the week, one of the executives named in the Times article, Richard DeVaul, resigned. Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said that his initial response and apology had not been forceful enough. He promised to support and work with internal critics. But all of this happened at a time when Silicon Valley was fixated on the role technology might have played in the deadly synagogue shooting last Saturday, not far from where I grew up in Pittsburgh, and the package bombs that were intercepted last week. In the days after those events, Kevin Roose looked at how Cesar Sayoc Jr., the man who was accused of sending the pipe bombs, had fallen into a maelstrom of right-wing conspiracy theories on Facebook and Twitter. These theories appear to have stoked Mr. Sayoc's anger toward the people, mostly Democratic politicians, who received the pipe bombs. Kevin followed that up by examining the online postings of Robert Bowers, the man accused in the slaughter in Pittsburgh, who had used the fringe online network Gab to voice his hatred of Jews and immigrants. Kevin also hosted two fascinating episodes of The Daily podcast, where he examined the rise of anger-stoking websites and Russian propaganda aimed at creating discord. The big social networks have, of course, been trying to confront the spread of divisive news and misinformation on their platforms. Facebook's quarterly financial results, which it announced on Tuesday, showed a slowdown in revenue that appears to have been caused, at least in part, by the company's efforts to rein in bad actors. But a flurry of reports this week underscored how ineffective these measures have been. A Vice reporter, William Turton, found that despite Facebook's new efforts at advertising transparency, he was able to get approval for ads that he posted in the name of fake political groups and sitting senators. When Twitter unveiled a page dedicated to capturing news on the midterm elections, BuzzFeed quickly noticed that the page was spotlighting disinformation. Even when one social network manages to drive away bad actors, those bad actors are generally able to find other online outlets for their activities. Sheera Frenkel, Mike Isaac and Kate Conger shined a spotlight on how Instagram has become the latest hot spot for anti-Semitic material. A few days after the synagogue shooting, a social network that began as a place to post happy vacation photos was found to be hosting over 11,000 posts with a hashtag that blamed Jews for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Kara Swisher, who has been covering the tech world for decades, wrote a column for The Times this week where she described how the internet, which promised to promote global harmony, has instead become a tool of hate. All in all, it was enough to make at least this reporter long for a time when a new iPad was the thing everything was talking about. Some other tech stories of note this week: ■ Nellie Bowles wrote a powerful trio of stories about our troubled relationship with the screens that dominate our lives. Her first story looked at how many people in Silicon Valley do everything in their power to keep their children away from screens. Some parents have gone so far as to bar the people taking care of their children from ever using a phone or other electronic device in front of the kids. Not long ago, people were worried about poor children missing out on the digital revolution. Now, Nellie reported, there is more concern that poor children are getting too much of the revolution, in the form of screen time, while wealthier parents keep their children away from addictive digital devices. ■ Most Americans have probably not heard of Bytedance, the Chinese company Raymond Zhong profiled this week. But the company has risen into an unlikely Goliath of the internet — with a value of around $75 billion — by serving up lots and lots of fluff. In China, the company has a bunch of different applications that allow young users to share everything from news to their latest break-dancing moves. Outside China, the company's video platform, TikTok, has gained popularity as a place to broadcast short, personal videos. ■ Thomas Fuller and Cade Metz explained that scientists are getting better at understanding earthquakes and potentially providing early warnings, thanks to artificial intelligence. Earthquake predictions have been notoriously bad, but some people in the field said their experiments had been helped by the kind of neural networks that are used to program talking digital assistants and driverless cars.

News,2018-11-02,"DAKAR, Senegal — The Nigerian Army, part of a military criticized for rampant human rights abuses, on Friday used the words of President Trump to justify its fatal shootings of rock-throwing protesters.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/world/africa/nigeria-trump-rocks.html,1312," DAKAR, Senegal — The Nigerian Army, part of a military criticized for rampant human rights abuses, on Friday used the words of President Trump to justify its fatal shootings of rock-throwing protesters. Soldiers fired this Monday on a march of about 1,000 Islamic Shiite activists who had blocked traffic on the outskirts of the capital, Abuja. Videos that circulated on social media showed several protesters hurling rocks at heavily armed soldiers who then shot fleeing demonstrators in the back. The Nigerian military said three protesters were killed, but the toll appears to have been much higher. Amnesty International and leaders of the protest said more than 40 people were killed at the march and two smaller marches, with more than 100 wounded by bullets. A Reuters reporter counted 20 bodies at the main march. Human rights activists and many Nigerians were outraged at the military's response, which echoed a similar confrontation in 2015, when soldiers killed nearly 350 protesters from the same group, the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, the largest and most recognizable face of Shiite Islam in the country. The group organizes frequent protest marches. Early Friday morning, the military responded to the criticism. The army's official Twitter account posted a video, ""Please Watch and Make Your Deductions,"" showing Mr. Trump's speech on Thursday in which he said rocks would be considered firearms if thrown toward the American military at the nation's borders. ""We're not going to put up with that,"" Mr. Trump said in the clip. ""They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back."" [Read how Trump's vulgar remarks about Africa didn't keep him and Nigeria's president from meeting.] The army deleted the post hours later without explanation after it had caused an uproar on social media. Mr. Trump is popular among groups in Nigeria's mostly Christian south that admire his tough talk against Islamic extremism. Though a polarizing figure, some people praise what they regard as his straightforwardness and frank talk, despite his reported insult last year when he said Nigerians in the United States would never ""go back to their huts"" in Africa. Earlier this year after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, during which Mr. Trump praised the Nigerian leader's fight against the Islamic State in West Africa, Mr. Trump said he never again wanted to meet someone so lifeless as Mr. Buhari, The Financial Times reported. On Friday, John Agim, a spokesman for the Nigerian Army, said the initial posting of the video was a response to Amnesty International, which had criticized what it called the military's use of excessive force. ""We released that video to say if President Trump can say that rocks are as good as a rifle, who is Amnesty International?"" he said. ""What are they then saying? What did David use to kill Goliath? So a stone is a weapon."" ""Our soldiers sustained injuries,"" he continued. ""The Shiites even burnt one of our vehicles, so what are Amnesty International saying?"" The army has said as many as six soldiers were wounded during the protest after ""thousands"" of members of the sect overran a police checkpoint and blocked traffic along a highway. Soldiers had arrived to assist the police, a news release said, and were met with protesters who threw canisters of fuel, ""large stones, catapults with dangerous objects and other dangerous items."" The military posted photos of six slingshots and one pocketknife on its Facebook page as evidence. ""They wanted to take over the checkpoint with their weapons,"" Mr. Agim said. ""They knew it was there. We responded to them."" Ibrahim Musa, a spokesman for the Shiite group, said that on Monday security forces refused to let protesters, who numbered about 1,000, pass the checkpoint as they marched toward their destination. He said 13 protesters were killed during two other marches this week, one before and one after Monday's deadly march. ""Rocks are not equal to bullets,"" he said. ""The use of force is disproportionate. I don't think President Trump is a good example — even in America many are critical of him. I am surprised that the army will use Trump as a role model."" There was no immediate comment from the White House on the Nigerian Army's posting. But asked on Friday about whether he condoned American soldiers' firing on migrants in a Mexico caravan if they attempted to cross the United States border, Mr. Trump said: ""They won't have to fire. What I don't want is, I don't want these people throwing rocks."" A State Department official in Washington, responding to the Nigerian shootings, said in a statement that the United States ""supports regional efforts to fight terrorism and protect civilians, employing our full tool kit — including diplomacy, foreign assistance, senior military engagement, and security assistance."" The statement was a reiteration of a Twitter posting on Thursday by Tibor Nagy, assistant secretary for the State Department's Bureau of African Affairs, in which he called for restraint on both sides and an investigation to hold all lawbreakers accountable. There was a conspicuous lack of comment on both the killings and the Nigerian Army's response from President Buhari and Atitku Abubakar, his main challenger in elections scheduled for next February. Their silence may partly reflect the antipathy toward the Islamic Movement of Nigeria in their own bases of support. There were also social-media expressions of support for the military's response. ""If the military in my country doesn't shoot back at a group of people who chose to block the highway and throw rocks at them, how would I trust them if they had to go toe-to-toe with a foreign enemy?!"" wrote a senior aide to the governor of Kogi State in central Nigeria. ""Please, use bullets to cure those fanatics of their madness!! Despite its history of massacring innocent civilians in the war with the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram, detaining innocent citizens and raping women and girls fleeing war-torn communities, the Nigerian military has been the recipient of warplane sales and other gear from the United States. American officials are particularly worried about a branch of Boko Haram operating in Nigeria that says it has ties to the Islamic State. A recent report mandated by Congress on the American strategy to improve security in Nigeria played down Nigerian military abuses, said Matthew Page, a former State Department expert on the region who is now an associate fellow in the Africa program of Chatham House, a British research group. Mr. Page said that even under the Obama administration, Washington sent mixed signals to Nigeria on human rights, adding that diplomats and policymakers have been ""house-trained by the Nigerian government to avoid public condemnation."" ""Such concerns are now voiced in private, if at all. Detainee deaths and child imprisonment continues, and extrajudicial killings by Nigerian soldiers are not even covered up anymore,"" he said. ""Under the Trump administration, any senior-level squeamishness about Nigerian military abuses has evaporated."" Almost 20 years after the end of military rule in Nigeria, protests are still viewed by many as a public disturbance and threat to the authorities. Additionally, the Islamic Movement of Nigeria is seen as a threat by some Nigerians to the Sunni form of Islam that is dominant in Nigeria's north. The group does not recognize the Nigerian Constitution, claiming it excludes protections for minorities. Many Nigerian authorities say the group has the larger aim of creating an Islamic republic inspired by Iran. In his meeting with President Buhari at the White House this year, Mr. Trump commented on the killings of Christians in Nigeria's Middle Belt, where clashes over land use have broken out between mostly Christian farmers and mostly Muslim herdsmen. ""We have had very serious problems with Christians who are being murdered in Nigeria,"" Mr. Trump told the Nigerian president, who is Muslim. While many farmers have died, the clashes also have killed scores of Muslim herders."
News,2018-11-03,"INDIANAPOLIS — When President Trump said Thursday he held a “long and very good conversation” on trade with President Xi Jinping of China, it kicked off a brief rally in financial markets and a flurry of questions about why the tensions between Washington and Beijing had suddenly eased.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/us/politics/trump-xi-trade.html,1313," INDIANAPOLIS — When President Trump said Thursday he held a ""long and very good conversation"" on trade with President Xi Jinping of China, it kicked off a brief rally in financial markets and a flurry of questions about why the tensions between Washington and Beijing had suddenly eased. The answer is, they haven't really. The explanation for Mr. Trump's newly soothing tone lies less in the state of trade negotiations — which remain on hold — than in the president's domestic political calculations, particularly in states heavily dependent on trade, like Indiana. Four days before a midterm election that features a nip-and-tuck Senate race in this state, Mr. Trump is trying to quell fears of a protracted trade war with China. His reassuring message may resonate in Indiana, the United States' largest producer of steel but also home to soybean farmers who have been hurt by China's retaliatory tariffs on American agriculture. ""We've had very good discussions with China,"" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House, as he left for a pair of political rallies in Indianapolis and Huntington, W.Va. ""We're getting much closer to doing something. They very much want to make a deal."" The president's enthusiasm was at odds with his advisers, who said nothing much had changed with Beijing. But it cheered investors in a market increasingly depressed by worries about a trade war. And analysts said it would pacify farmers and factory workers across the Midwest. Mr. Trump came to Indiana to campaign for Mike Braun, a Republican who is trying to unseat the Democratic incumbent, Senator Joe Donnelly. Mr. Donnelly has a slim lead in the polls, but Mr. Braun has made inroads lately, in part by challenging his opponent on trade. ""I spoke to President Xi today,"" Mr. Trump told a raucous crowd at a high school here. ""They want to make a deal, but we have to have a fair deal. We have to have a deal that's fair for the United States."" The president took credit for the recently revised North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which he called a ""giant victory for Indiana farmers, manufacturers and dairy producers."" The trade showdown with China, however, has whipsawed Indiana, benefiting it in some ways while hurting it in others. Steel mills in the industrial north are prospering because of Mr. Trump's tariffs on China and other steel exporters. But soybean farmers are suffering because of the retaliatory tariffs China imposed on agricultural exports. Companies that make auto parts are able to charge higher prices because of a loss of competition from China. But the recreational vehicle industry, one of Indiana's manufacturing pillars, worries that sales will be hurt if it passes along those higher prices to customers. ""The R. V. industry could be in a period of transition,"" said Richard Curtin, an economist at the University of Michigan, who studies the industry. A deal with China ""would be widely welcomed,"" he said. ""The closer you are to these industries, the more it would be welcomed."" Mr. Trump's phone call to Mr. Xi, however, did not appear to be linked to any progress in trade negotiations. Those talks have been on hiatus for weeks, and officials said they did not expect any progress at least until the two presidents meet, which is likely to be at the Group of 20 meeting of industrialized nations in Buenos Aires early next month. Mr. Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, dismissed reports that Mr. Trump asked his cabinet to draft a trade deal with China and said ""there's no massive movement"" to get something done quickly. ""We're doing a normal, routine run-through of things that we've already put together and normal preparation,"" Mr. Kudlow said on Friday on CNBC. ""We're not on the cusp of a deal."" Still, after warning for weeks that China was not ready to negotiate on trade with the United States, Mr. Trump took an uncharacteristically conciliatory tone after his call with Mr. Xi, which was both unusually long — 56 minutes — and initiated by him. ""We talked about many subjects, with a heavy emphasis on Trade,"" Mr. Trump said on Twitter. ""Those discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina."" Mr. Xi issued a similarly warm statement on Friday, reaffirming the importance of his personal relationship with Mr. Trump and predicting that the two sides could reach a deal. Chinese officials have been taken aback by the vehemence of Mr. Trump's language against them, and Mr. Xi's response suggested he was eager to lower the temperature. Administration officials caution that the gulf between the two countries remained wide over issues like market access and China's alleged purloining of technology from American companies. Any deal, they said, would require specific pledges on the part of the Chinese. In a sign of the administration's determination to keep up the pressure, the Justice Department took legal action this week against two companies based in China and Taiwan, accusing them of stealing trade secrets from Micron Technology, an American technology company. The Trump administration remains divided internally between officials who want to take an uncompromising approach toward China — allying the European Union and other trading partners in a united front — and those who favor cutting some kind of deal. In recent months, Mr. Trump has sided with the hard-liners, though he remains unpredictable, particularly when there are other considerations at play, as his most recent about-face demonstrates. Mr. Trump, people who know him said, was also motivated by a desire to give the markets a tonic, days before voters go to the polls. The president has regularly boasted about rising stock prices since he took office, but the markets have given up those gains in recent weeks. The Chinese are also seeking to defuse the situation at a time when their own economy and currency are showing signs of weakening. Still, they remain confounded by Mr. Trump — especially his recent claims that they are attempting to interfere in the midterm elections — and they still feel burned by the president's rejection of a steel deal negotiated last year by his commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross. Craig Allen, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents 200 American companies that do business with China, said Chinese nationalism would make it ""difficult for any Chinese leader to accept anything that is a less than equal agreement."" Trade concerns have dominated the Senate race in Indiana, with Mr. Donnelly and Mr. Braun, both of whom have business ties, accusing each other of selling out American workers. ""I voted against every bad trade deal that hurts Hoosiers,"" Mr. Donnelly said in one recent campaign ad, in which he stands next to a pickup truck loaded with boxes of auto parts sold by Mr. Braun's company — each bearing a sticker that says, ""Made in China."" ""Mike Braun has used those same deals to outsource Hoosier jobs to China."" Some analysts here said they were dubious that Mr. Trump's shifting tone on trade would drastically change the outcome in Indiana, a state he won by 19 points in 2016 and in which he remains popular. ""I have been amazed by the steadfast support of farmers for the president,"" said Mike Yoder, a Republican who is the commissioner of Elkhart County. ""They have been willing to stick by this president, and if there is some plan for an endgame on tariffs, it has escaped me."" But Mr. Yoder said he welcomed Mr. Trump's softer tone. Elkhart County is a manufacturing hub, with assembly lines that produce recreational vehicles, as well as trucks and buses. Tariffs on steel and aluminum are driving up the cost of parts for these manufacturers. ""It is a good message,"" Mr. Yoder said, ""because for Indiana — and especially Elkhart County — these tariffs need to go away."""
News,2018-11-03,"Six years ago, the University of Maryland announced with great fanfare that it had made a leap to one of the nation’s most powerful athletic conferences, a move that carried the promise of riches and prestige.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/sports/maryland-football-durkin.html,1280," Six years ago, the University of Maryland announced with great fanfare that it had made a leap to one of the nation's most powerful athletic conferences, a move that carried the promise of riches and prestige. This week, the gambit blew up in spectacular fashion over three tumultuous days during which the president announced his retirement, the football coach was fired and the chairman of the university's governing board resigned. The trigger was the death of a 19-year-old football player named Jordan McNair, who collapsed from heatstroke after practice in the sweltering heat in May and died two weeks later. The resulting controversy became a power struggle fed by enormous financial and political pressures. And hovering over it all was the question of who at the University of Maryland would be held responsible for the McNair tragedy. Ultimately, the week's turbulence brought to the fore tensions among those trying to protect a big-time college athletic program and those who feared that the handling of Mr. McNair's death was severely damaging the university's image and a $1.5 billion fund-raising campaign aimed at elevating the school's academic standing. ""We have got politicians involved, students upset and the public wondering what's going on,"" said Mike Freiman, a former president of the Terrapin Club, an athletic donors' organization.  A three-way battle was waged among the university president, Wallace D. Loh; the football coach, D.J. Durkin; and the politically connected chairman of the Board of Regents, James T. Brady. By the end of the week, Mr. Durkin and Mr. Brady were out, and Mr. Loh was headed into retirement at the end of the academic year. The governor, Larry Hogan, a Republican seeking re-election in a blue state, also entered the fray. As public pressure mounted, with university donors growing upset and his Democratic challenger denouncing his inaction, Governor Hogan voiced his displeasure about how the board was handling the crisis. The trouble grew on Tuesday after the board announced, as Mr. Loh looked on visibly upset, that Mr. Durkin would remain as the school's coach, despite a report highly critical of the football program's culture. Mr. Loh, who had pushed for the 2014 move to the football-oriented Big Ten Conference, wanted to dismiss Mr. Durkin but was overruled by the Brady-led board. The resulting public furor emboldened Mr. Loh to buck the board's wishes and fire Mr. Durkin on Wednesday. Mr. Brady stepped down the next day, having lost the support of Governor Hogan, whose campaign he ran in 2014. This account of the last week of maneuvering is based on interviews with more than a dozen people close to the process, most of whom declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. Through representatives, Mr. Loh and Mr. Durkin declined to comment. Late last week, the 17-member board met at the University System of Maryland headquarters in Baltimore. It received Mr. Loh, Damon Evans, the athletic director, and Mr. Durkin one by one. The meeting was intended to resolve a crisis that started with Mr. McNair's death and snowballed after an ESPN article in August portrayed the program as one in which staff members humiliated and bullied players in a way that has fallen out of favor in big-time college football. After that ESPN report, the university suspended two athletic trainers and reached an agreement for the resignation of the strength coach, Rick Court — who was depicted in the article as the ringleader of a ""toxic culture."" Mr. Durkin was hired after the university left the basketball-oriented Atlantic Coast Conference for the Big Ten, which could eventually net tens of millions of dollars more in revenue for Maryland. The ESPN report noted that some players had taken issue with Mr. Durkin's intense style and the fact that Mr. Court was one of his first hires. The university's inquiry into the football program was formally released this week. But the board had it in hand last week as it met Mr. Loh, Mr. Durkin and Mr. Evans. The report partly blamed Mr. Durkin, but it also partly absolved him, characterizing the first-time head coach — who was hired after the 2015 season, when he was just 37 — as overmatched in his new job. It also said he had not received sufficient support from the athletic department or the university, given Maryland's lofty ambitions in its new conference. ""Mr. Durkin was hired under high-pressure circumstances and tasked with turning a struggling football program into a Big Ten contender, with less funding and fan support than other conference programs,"" the report said. After reading the report, the majority of the board advocated ending Mr. Loh's tenure as president. Word of the board's plans got back to Mr. Loh, who requested a chance to make his case. When he spoke to the board last week, Mr. Loh cautioned that abruptly changing leadership would destabilize the university. He also argued that he could help carry out changes recommended in the report. Finally, he warned that retaining Mr. Durkin would send the campus into turmoil. Mr. Durkin spoke later, and by several accounts was persuasive. He is an acolyte of two of college football's premier coaches, Urban Meyer of Ohio State and Jim Harbaugh of Michigan. After he spoke to the board, it decided not to fire him. By Monday, the board had decided that both Mr. Durkin and Mr. Evans would stay. But the board does not have the authority to hire or fire university personnel other than the president. So Mr. Loh, whom a majority still wanted to terminate, had to be the one to retain Mr. Durkin and Mr. Evans. Instead of immediately being dismissed, Mr. Loh was permitted to retire in June, at the end of the academic year. On Wednesday, Mr. Loh had several meetings with campus department heads and deans, undergraduate student government leaders and the faculty senate's executive committee. Mr. Durkin oversaw his first practice in nearly three months, though a clamor was growing on campus over his staying and Mr. Loh's leaving. Statements from deans and distinguished professors warned of what they characterized as inappropriate board interference. Students held a rally, while political leaders and even the chief of the university's foundation, an important fund-raising arm, spoke out with disapproval. When Governor Hogan — who appointed many regents, and, if the polls are correct, stands to win re-election and appoint more — joined in the opposition to Mr. Durkin's staying, the situation seemed untenable. Mr. Hogan was not privy to the regents' deliberations, according to a spokeswoman. Benjamin Jealous, his Democratic opponent, had called on him to fire board members, though Mr. Hogan lacks the authority to directly do so in the absence of extreme misconduct. But Mr. Loh had already planned his move. On Halloween evening, he announced that he was defying the board and firing Mr. Durkin. ""The chair of the Board of Regents has publicly acknowledged that I had previously raised serious concerns about Coach Durkin's return,"" Mr. Loh said, adding, ""However, a departure is in the best interest of the university."" The politics of the moment — campus anger, national opprobrium, the disdain of donors — seemed at once to compel and vindicate Mr. Loh's decision. As it turned out, Mr. Loh outlasted not only Mr. Durkin but also Mr. Brady, who resigned Thursday evening. ""I respect the many people — including elected leaders, members of the public and members of the board — who disagreed with the recommendations a majority of this board ultimately made,"" he said. The Maryland football team, under its interim head coach, Matt Canada, takes the field against Michigan State at home Saturday."
News,2018-11-03,"To promote his administration’s decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran, President Trump turned Friday to the wildly popular television show “Game of Thrones.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/us/hbo-trump-game-of-thrones.html,533," To promote his administration's decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran, President Trump turned Friday to the wildly popular television show ""Game of Thrones."" In a tweet that featured a cinematic poster with a steely depiction of the president, he included the words ""Sanctions Are Coming."" That phrase mimicked one from the show, ""Winter Is Coming,"" a foreboding line that warns of a deep freeze that will herald an army of the undead from the north to conquer other lands. HBO responded to Mr. Trump with a message of its own: Keep us out of it. ""We were not aware of this messaging and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes,"" an HBO spokesman, Quentin Schaffer, said in a statement. pic.twitter.com/nk2vKvHuaL HBO's official statement came after a dose of snark on Twitter in response to Mr. Trump's tweet. ""How do you say trademark misuse in Dothraki?"" the company wrote. (Dothraki is a language spoken by a group of nomadic warriors, also called Dothraki, in ""Game of Thrones."") Two members of the ""Thrones"" cast gave personal reactions of distaste. Sophie Turner, the English actress who plays Sansa Stark in the show, replied to Mr. Trump's tweet with a blunt ""Ew."" And Maisie Williams, an English actress who plays Sansa's sister, Arya Stark, responded, ""Not today.""  The White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday evening. Politicians have referred to the trademark phrase before. In 2015, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, tweeted ""Big News Is Coming"" to foreshadow the expected announcement that he was running for president. Mr. Schaffer, the HBO spokesman, said that apart from Mr. Trump using the phrase, the company prefers that others don't use it to ""promote their own agendas."" Several years ago, in a series of tweets, Mr. Trump repeatedly called for television viewers to cancel their HBO accounts because the network carried the late-night host Bill Maher's talk show. Mr. Trump had a  feud with Mr. Maher at the time. Musical artists including R.E.M. and Aerosmith have previously asked Mr. Trump to stop using their songs at his rallies. Elton John, whose music Mr. Trump has played consistently at his rallies, told The Guardian in 2016 that he didn't want his music involved in American politics. Mr. Trump's play on the ""Thrones"" phrase on Friday had a clearly partisan angle. On Friday, his administration reaffirmed sanctions on Iran days before the midterm elections. On Saturday, a news site tweeted what it said was a response on Instagram from Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian leader of the elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The general's poster also used the ""Game of Thrones"" font, and his message in Farsi read: ""Come! We are waiting, I will stand against you. Quds Force will stand against you. You start this war, but we will finish it."" The sanctions, promised in May, will target more than 700 businesses, individuals and other entities involved in Iran's oil, banking, shipping, shipbuilding and insurance sectors. The Trump administration also announced on Friday that it was exempting eight countries from the Nov. 5 deadline for nations to cease importing Iranian goods or face financial penalties."
News,2018-11-03,"PARIS — A few days before Paris St.-Germain traveled to Liverpool in September to begin its latest quest to win the Champions League, Dani Alves and Kylian Mbappé stood on a stage in a starkly lit room in the basement of the Parc des Princes.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/sports/psg-jordan-brand-fashion.html,1449," PARIS — A few days before Paris St.-Germain traveled to Liverpool in September to begin its latest quest to win the Champions League, Dani Alves and Kylian Mbappé stood on a stage in a starkly lit room in the basement of the Parc des Princes. In front of them, a crowd of dozens of journalists, social-media influencers and fashion bloggers milled around, watching freestyle soccer players run through their dazzling array of tricks. The décor was industrial chic. Exposed pipes ran along the ceiling. Goal posts and basketball hoops had been arranged to create a replica of an urban ball court. Alves and Mbappé — alongside Wang Shuang and Marie-Antoinette Katoto, members of P.S.G.'s women's team — were not there to play, though. They were there to stand, to pose, to model. For once, inside their home stadium, they were not the star attractions. All anyone cared about, really, was what they were wearing. This was the launch of the latest in a line of ambitious collaborations between P.S.G., the perennial champion of France, and a fashion brand. Alves and Mbappé were there to showcase Nike's new P.S.G. jersey: a sleek, black number designed by the company's Jordan Brand, with the club's crest redesigned to incorporate the famed Jumpman logo. The team is wearing the new kit in the Champions League this season — a uniform for the conquest of Europe — but it exists because P.S.G.'s horizons have shifted far from the old world, onto soccer's emerging markets of Asia and North America, and the wealth that awaits within them. ""We go,"" the P.S.G. merchandising executive Fabien Allègre said, ""where other clubs don't."" The connection between P.S.G. — the French capital's only top-flight soccer team — and the city's fashion houses is a longstanding one. The designer Daniel Hechter served as the club's president for five years in the 1970s, and is regarded as one of the driving forces behind the team's foundation. It was Hechter who designed P.S.G.'s traditional look — a red vertical stripe, bordered with white, on a blue background — during his reign. The story goes that he based his creation on the red-and-white jersey worn by Ajax, the Dutch champion dominating European competition at the time. Increasingly, though, P.S.G. is using both that bond and Paris's reputation as a global fashion hub to forge its 21st-century identity. The ambition of the club's owner — Qatar Sports Investments, an investment arm of the Qatari state — to turn its team into a soccer superpower is well known. It has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in players in recent years, including the $222 million deal that made Neymar the most expensive signing in history in 2017. Its vision does not stop there, however. Even if it is aware that P.S.G. as a club might never have the same allure or history as Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich on the field, it believes it can overtake anyone off it. ""Paris means fashion, style, creativity and energy,"" Nasser al-Khelaifi, the P.S.G. president, said. ""We want P.S.G. to embrace those values that make the city so unique. Not everyone else can do this."" In plainer terms, Qatar Sports Investments has set out to make Paris St.-Germain cool. The partnership with Nike, and Jordan, is hardly the first step on the way. The club also has sponsorship deals with the likes of Levi Strauss and Beats. And last year, P.S.G. worked with the Rolling Stones and Nike to produce exclusive merchandise to celebrate the arrival of the rock band in the French capital. The clothes were sold at Colette, one of Paris's trendiest boutiques. In 2017, the club was featured at Paris Fashion Week, thanks to a capsule collection by the fashion house Koché. In it, the company's creative designer, Christelle Kocher, used the team's jersey in a range of outfits lined with crystals, silk and muslin. ""Paris rhymes with style, with fashion, with glamour, and P.S.G. has the Eiffel Tower on its logo, so playing with these concepts makes so much sense for them as a brand,"" Kocher said. ""It is kind of obvious now, but it wasn't before P.S.G. made these partnerships,"" This year, a collection by the Indian designer Manish Arora produced with the Chinese and Indian markets in mind incorporated colorful, heavily stylized portraits of players, including Mbappé, Thiago Silva and Edinson Cavani on T-shirts, jackets and dresses. Cameos on the catwalk, though, are only one element of P.S.G.'s attempts to infiltrate the fashion world. The club has a team of four employees, managed by Allègre, working full time on brand diversification, searching for ways to help P.S.G. become something more than just a soccer team. The club has established collaborations with more than a dozen designers and artists: brands like Afterhomework, Maison Labiche and Blume, as well as Nick Fouquet, a hatmaker based in Los Angeles, and Georges Esquivel, a shoemaker. The partnerships, Allègre said, are aimed largely at ""American fans that may not know P.S.G. as a club but adhere to our project as a lifestyle brand.""  That reputation has been created, in part, by the frequent sightings of famous faces like Naomi Campbell, Leonardo DiCaprio, Rihanna and the Kardashians — in the V.I.P. boxes at the Parc des Princes. Virgil Abloh, Louis Vuitton's artistic director, is a regular at matches. Taking in a P.S.G. game has become fashionable, it seems, for any Hollywood star or prominent athlete visiting Paris. But the club's jersey and crest have become something of a fashion statement for the A-list, too: Beyoncé and the British singer Rita Ora have worn pieces by Koché. Justin Timberlake wore a jacket emblazoned with the then-unreleased Jumpman logo at a concert in Paris in July, and LeBron James turned up for a Los Angeles Lakers game in a P.S.G. shirt last month.  P.S.G. insists all of that interest is entirely organic. ""Some stars want to come,"" Allègre said. ""Others are invited."" To the deeply cynical soccer world, though, there is a fine line between Hollywood sheen and public-relations artifice. P.S.G.'s celebrity following has served simply to accentuate its reputation as somehow inauthentic, a plaything for the rich and famous, a passionately supported team turned into a high-end tourist destination. For all that fans of the team worry that its soul has been lost, there is a sporting purpose behind the club owner's approach. The fashion collaborations and the celebrity appearances, the club believes, can have a genuine impact on its fortunes. ""Since we bought the club, we have tried to be even more different, more unique, more creative,"" Khelaifi said in an interview at the launch of the Air Jordan event. ""This partnership is going to bring us more fans around the world: fans who love basketball and soccer, who love fashion, who love Michael Jordan and who love Paris."" It is an approach that Kocher, at least, contends is working. Her collection, she said, helped the club ""raise the prestige of the brand"" and would convince those inclined to be scornful of soccer that the worlds could commingle. ""I have had fashion fans who have told me that they would never have worn a soccer outfit, but this is kind of hip and almost desirable,"" she said. When she visited a luxury boutique P.S.G. opened in Tokyo this fall, she said, she noted that many of the lifestyle items had sold out. Much the same happened with the Jordan Brand collection. The club's website had to be recalibrated to cope with a surge in demand once it went on sale, and snaking lines of fans eager to buy the gear formed outside P.S.G.'s store in central Paris. Not everyone has been so positive. Many of the club's most ardent supporters were unhappy when Hechter's classic jersey design was jettisoned this summer in favor of a reimagined Nike design, worn in domestic games, that no longer boasts a plain red stripe on a blue background. The forays into high fashion are unlikely to appease them. Qatar Sports Investments, though, will point to the end game. P.S.G. cannot rely on infusions of Qatari cash forever — it has twice flirted with severe punishment under UEFA's Financial Fair Play legislation, and disclosures on Friday raised new questions about its efforts to skirt the rules. So it has to find whatever way it can of closing both a financial and reputational gap on those clubs it believes to be its peers. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern have the advantage of history, of multiple Champions League titles, of galleries of former star players. P.S.G. is still playing catch-up, and must look to eke out whatever advantage it can. By conquering the world of fashion, by becoming a chic, aspirational brand, by appearing on the catwalk and the sidewalk, by seeing its players as models, it hopes it can begin to do that."
News,2018-11-03,"When Gabi Stack imagines herself at 75, she pictures a life that ideally includes a move to Germany, lots of travel and ample time for lingering at cafes with friends.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/business/saving-retirement-games.html,1417," When Gabi Stack imagines herself at 75, she pictures a life that ideally includes a move to Germany, lots of travel and ample time for lingering at cafes with friends. So she was startled last week when she received a digitally ""aged"" photo of herself that didn't match her self-image of an active, independent person. ""I truly hope I don't look like the picture,"" she said, noting extra wrinkles creasing her forehead and a ""fatter"" face. ""I'll find out in 20 years if I look like that."" The image was created at an employee benefits fair on Maui, in Hawaii, using an app called AgingBooth. The idea is to get employees to think more concretely about their future, older selves — and motivate them to make financial plans. Mrs. Stack, now a 55-year-old mental health care coordinator for the State of Hawaii, volunteered as a lark with Prudential Financial, her retirement plan administrator. Despite the shock of the photo, Mrs. Stack still thought taking it was fun. And that reaction is precisely what many employers and retirement plan sponsors are aiming for, with new tactics to entice workers into planning for retirement — a task almost universally acknowledged as unpleasant. Employers are luring their workers with new techniques like applying computer programs to artificially age photos and using games and quizzes to engage them on retirement and financial topics. Brian Moto, chairman of the board for the State of Hawaii Deferred Compensation Plan, which helped organize the benefits fair, said AgingBooth could be off-putting, but useful even for those who watched from a distance. ""Some of them cautiously say, as I did, 'Oh, no, thank you, I really don't want to see myself,'"" Mr. Moto said. ""For a lot of people aging is something serious — it's not always easy either to accept or deal with, but at least we got them to think and pause."" Some employers are reporting greater success at reaching their workers using games and quizzes rather than more traditional brochures and spreadsheets. With this in mind, the retirement plan provider and investment firm TIAA created a competition for its clients, Square Up Your Savings and Financial IQ, held at more than 7,000 plan participant offices around the country. For one game in particular, men and millennial players appeared especially motivated by competition, with men logging 40 percent and millennials 50 percent more clicks on their rankings than other demographic groups, according to TIAA. Millennial employees, too, showed greater interest in the games than older workers did — in one instance, employees 24 to 34 years old represented the highest number of repeat users, logging eight quizzes per player, the company said. Stephanie Maksymiw is one of those avid players. Among the first to take TIAA's quiz, she understood the difference between stocks and bonds and was confident her knowledge about investing would help her ace the financial questions in the online competition held at her workplace, SRC Inc. But to her surprise, when she took the quiz for the first time, the results revealed big gaps in her understanding, like the definitions of bear and bull markets. Determined to improve her score, Ms. Maksymiw played every day for three weeks, ultimately getting an ""above average"" ranking compared with her colleagues. ""It was competitive,"" recalled Ms. Maksymiw, 37, a quality systems analyst SRC, a military research nonprofit based in Syracuse, about how she and her co-workers tracked their rankings on their retirement plan sponsor TIAA's public scoreboard. SRC is just one of thousands of companies turning to online games to engage employees about money and retirement topics. Prudential created the Procrastinator Quiz to help people better identify why they delay making important decisions about their investments and retirement. The firm Voya Financial, formerly ING, presents its retirement planning quizzes, tools and information on a  virtual game board that a ""player"" advances along. Mr. Moto described another visualization exercise in which attendees of benefits fairs are asked to mark the age of the oldest person they know on a large vertical panel to emphasize the importance of planning for long lives. The stakes of these efforts are high. A report published in May by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system showed that under two-fifths of non-retired American adults described their retirement savings as on track, and one-quarter had no retirement savings or pension at all. Preparing for retirement can be a confusing and overwhelming task, and three-fifths of non-retirees reported ""little or no comfort in managing their investments"" in self-directed retirement savings accounts, according to the Fed report, in which 12,246 people were surveyed. On average, those surveyed answered fewer than three of five basic financial literacy questions correctly. While there is some question about the efficacy of education alone to improve financial decision-making, investment firms behind the efforts say games can bring more people into a conversation about retirement planning, making it less stressful and dull. David Ray, a TIAA senior managing director, said the games' competitive aspect helped draw people in. ""It's just human nature"" to compare yourself with others, he said. ""The fact that we maintain a leader board stokes those competitive fires even more — you can move along the scale from a more novice rating to an expert rating — everyone wants to be an expert."" Despite the apparent interest in games among both investors and investment firms, some research has cast doubt on long-term improvements in financial literacy. One study — conducted by Shawn Cole at Harvard Business School, Anna Paulson at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Gauri Kartini Shastry at Wellesley College — examined the results of mandatory financial literacy courses in schools and found ""no effect"" on savings and investment behavior. ""What worries me is people have this intuition that it's all about information,"" according to Dan Ariely, the James B. Duke Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University. ""Information alone is very unlikely to help,"" he said. Other organizations, such as the nonprofit Commonwealth based in Boston, are aiming to bridge the gap between thinking and doing. With support from the Treasury Department, Commonwealth tested an app aimed at helping lower-income high school students, called Ramp It Up, in which players complete college and career-readiness projects like creating a financial aid account, or searching for scholarships, in order to advance in the game. Ms. Maksymiw, for one, said the games helped her decide to double her contribution to her company's retirement plan, and she now reads her quarterly statements. After yielding much of the responsibility for managing her savings and investments to her father — ""he's been doing that since before I was born,"" she said — she now says her goal is to take over more of the decisions for her own money outside her retirement plan. But when it comes to retirement planning, some persistent negative perceptions of aging may be one of the biggest obstacles, said Tamara Sims, a research scientist with Stanford's Center on Longevity. Her latest research, conducted with Jeanne Tsai, a professor in Stanford's psychology department, demonstrates that people who focus more on what they lose than what they gain show a greater reluctance to think and plan for their later years. Her survey included the questions: ""What do you look forward to about being 75 and older?"" and ""What do you dread?"" Those with more negative perceptions tended to focus on physical and cognitive limitations while those who looked forward to aging emphasized more lifestyle benefits, like social connections, family, enjoying nature or leisure, she said. ""Your future self is an abstract concept,"" Dr. Sims said. Even a simple writing exercise focusing on the ways you would like to take care of an older you can help people perceive their future more clearly. This could help spur planning for retirement, shifting a discussion away from the downsides of aging to, ""This isn't a scary, frightening thing but this is something I look forward to,"" she said. It was this idea of an exciting new chapter that motivated Mrs. Stack to move up her target retirement age a few years ago, to 58 from 62, and prompted her to take a hard look at her expenses and income in retirement. ""Of course you can always have more money, but how much do you really need?"" she asked. ""And what is more important, to enjoy your life or to amass these large amounts of savings but you have nothing to show for it?"""
News,2018-11-03,"The United States economy is the strongest it has been in ages. Growth has been robust, and the unemployment rate is at generational lows, as new data Friday affirmed.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/upshot/how-the-economic-lives-of-the-middle-class-have-changed-since-2016-by-the-numbers.html,1535," The United States economy is the strongest it has been in ages. Growth has been robust, and the unemployment rate is at generational lows, as new data Friday affirmed. Yet the Republican Party, which controls the White House and Congress, trails Democrats substantially in polling on which party is preferred. It helps to look beyond the overall economic data to understand this disconnect. After all, you can't eat G.D.P., and good jobs numbers aren't the same as a place to live. If you look instead at the actual financial lives of average middle-income families from 2016 — their incomes, spending, assets and debt — and how shifts since Election Day in 2016 would have been likely to affect them, you get a more mixed picture. Wages haven't risen much. Inflation has been low, helping keep the price of most staple goods down, though with gasoline prices a costly exception. The tax cut has left more money in most middle-class families' pockets, but only a bit.  In terms of assets, the typical middle-income family has either zero or minimal holdings in the stock market, meaning the surge since November 2016 hasn't paid direct benefits. But a majority of households in this income bracket do carry some credit card debt, which has become more expensive amid rising interest rates. And in terms of housing costs, rents haven't risen much — but a sharp rise in mortgage rates has made homes less affordable for anyone looking to buy. Add it all up, and while the benefits of a surging economy, tax cuts and the rising stock market are real, they net out to a less favorable economic reality for a family in the middle of the income scale than the economic headlines might imply.  This math is oversimplified — it doesn't reflect how families may have changed their spending and saving patterns in the last two years, and conflates different definitions of middle income. But the back-of-the-envelope results are revealing: If you take the benefits of higher wages and the lower taxes, subtracting higher costs for consumer goods and higher interest rates on credit card debt — it works out to a gain of $122 a month. A lower unemployment rate may benefit workers by making it easier for someone who loses a job to find a new one. But a defining feature of the expansion for years has been relatively tepid growth in wages. The median pay for a full-time worker in the United States — now $893 a week — has risen enough since late 2016 to generate an extra $204 a month in pretax earnings for a household with a single earner, a 5.6 percent gain. Subtract payroll taxes and federal income taxes on that raise, and that family is looking at $158 a month in additional earnings.  The tax cuts enacted at the start of 2018 should mean most middle-income Americans keep a bit more of their earnings. Analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that of the 91 percent of middle-income tax filers who received a tax cut, the reduction averages $910, or about $76 a month.  Wages may not be growing very fast for middle-income people, but the good news is that prices of most of the things they buy have been rising even more slowly. The Consumer Price Index excluding housing costs is up only 3.2 percent since November 2016, adding about $101 to the monthly expenses of a family with spending patterns that match those of an average family in the middle 20 percent of the income distribution that year. When you look at individual items that compose a large portion of family budgets, the relatively low inflation comes through. Grocery prices — ""food at home"" in the Labor Department's terminology — are up only 1.1 percent in the nearly two years since November 2016, adding $3.33 to the monthly grocery bill for an average family in the middle 20 percent of income. Outside of food, the pattern mostly recurs. Electricity bills are up 0.42 percent, a mere 50 cents a month of additional expense. Apparel is slightly less expensive than it was in November 2016, saving a middle-class family $1.22 a month. An 11 percent drop in the price of cellphone service saves that family $10.48 each month. The big exception is gasoline; its price has been marching steadily higher since late 2016. The 23.5 percent run-up in the price of motor fuels adds $37.38 to the typical family's monthly expenses. When it comes to housing, it matters a lot whether you're renting and planning to continue renting; renting but seeking to buy a home; or already own one. For renters who plan to stay renters, costs are rising modestly, just like overall inflation — 3 percent since November 2016, tacking an extra $26.54 onto monthly costs for the average renter. Homeowners typically have their monthly mortgage costs already set. Their wealth — the value of their home — has risen a bit in two years. The median sale price for a home in the United States was $214,000 in November 2016, according to data from Zillow, and the national appreciation rate since then implies such a house would now be worth $230,000. Things are trickier for a renter looking to buy a home, because of rising mortgage rates. A side effect of the surging economy and deficit-increasing tax cuts has been higher rates, which means that even though home prices aren't up all that much in the last two years, the cost for a buyer needing credit is considerably higher. The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.5 percent at election time two years ago, and is now 4.83 percent. Combined with the rise in the price of the median home, a middle-income American family looking to buy with 20 percent down would be looking at a monthly mortgage payment that is $196 a month higher now than in November 2016, wiping out gains from higher wages and lower taxes. The Trump administration has pointed to the booming stock market as evidence of success: The Standard & Poor's 500 index has returned about 29 percent, including reinvested dividends, since November 2016. But middle-income families typically have minimal direct exposure to the stock market. Their financial holdings tend to be modest at best, meaning that rising stock prices create only a small wealth increase. Among middle-income families in 2016, only 52 percent held stocks either directly or indirectly, such as through a mutual fund. And of those 52 percent, median stock holdings were only $15,000. (That would be up to around $19,000 now if they left the money in an S.&P. 500 index fund since then without making further contributions.) Stock investments are much more a feature of upper-income brackets. The same survey showed that 94.7 percent of families in the top 10 percent of income held stocks, with a median value of $363,400. Many middle-income Americans, 84.3 percent of them, do tend to hold some form of debt. And rising interest rates in the Trump economy — a consequence of strong economic growth and Federal Reserve actions meant to prevent the economy from overheating — are making that debt more costly. In 2016, 53 percent of middle-income households had credit card debt, with an average debt balance of $4,400. The average rate on such debt has risen to 16.5 percent today from 13.6 percent in November 2016, implying an extra $10.50 a month in interest cost for a family carrying that balance. In other words, debtors — and the average middle-class American fits that description — are paying a price for the surging economy even as they enjoy the benefits of higher pay and low inflation. Given the limitations in the data on which these calculations are based, it's best to think of this analysis as an impressionistic painting rather than a high-resolution photograph of the economic lives of the middle class. But it is a telling one, and helps explains the limits of a political message built on what seems to be a booming economy. It booms for some people more than others. To develop this portrait, we started with two government surveys from 2016: the Labor Department's Consumer Expenditure Survey, which provides details of household spending patterns broken down by income bracket, and the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, which details assets and debt. Then, we simply extrapolated forward to the fall of 2018. If those patterns among middle-class families held steady as they were buffeted by economywide forces, would they be better or worse off in the days before the midterms? This is assuming that they had no radical changes to their financial lives like getting a lucrative new job or winning the lottery, and that their wages, costs and investment performances plugged along at average rates over the last 23 months. Because of limitations in the data available for the recent past, we had to combine data sources that aren't really meant to be combined. We had to switch between different definitions of middle income, and we made some simplifying assumptions. (For example, we calculated how higher gasoline prices would increase people's spending without adjusting for how they might react to higher prices by driving less.)"

Chloe Brown, a Universal Life minister and a friend of the couple, officiated at a ceremony that incorporated Hindu wedding traditions. The bride, who is 33 and works in Mexico City, is the regional manager for ethics and compliance at Goldcorp, a gold mining company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, with operations across Canada and Latin America. She graduated from Middlebury College and received a master's degree in global affairs at the University of Toronto. She is a daughter of Barbara E. Jordan and Allan L. Morrison of Toronto. The bride's father is the principal and founder of a Toronto-based international and commercial law firm that bears his name. Her mother, who is retired, was a consultant in Toronto for Toronto Children's Services. The groom, also 33, is the senior adviser to the under secretary for International Affairs at the Department of the Treasury in Washington. He previously served as the Treasury Department's financial attaché to Mexico and Central America, and was based in Mexico City. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University, from which he also received a master's degree in international finance and a Ph.D. in international political economy. He is the author of ""Social Finance: Shadow Banking During the Global Financial Crisis"" (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018). He is the son of Shaila K. Shenai and Kamalakar P. Shenai of Orlando, Fla. The groom's mother, who is retired, was the vice president for marketing production at the Xerox Corporation in Rochester. His father, also retired, was the chief client officer of Sutherland Global Services, a business process outsourcing firm in Rochester. When Ms. Morrison booked a one-way ticket to Mexico City in September 2014, leaving behind a good job in Toronto, ""everyone thought I was crazy,"" she said. ""But Mexico was undergoing fiscal and financial reform, which opened up many new opportunities."" She soon found work there as a senior associate in the investigations and dispute practice at Kroll, a corporate investigations and risk consulting firm based in New York. In December 2016, she found Mr. Shenai, whom she was introduced to through a mutual friend at a bar in Mexico City. He had arrived three months earlier, just after being appointed the Treasury Department's representative to Mexico and Central America. ""I had broken up with the woman I was seeing prior to moving because neither of us wanted to date long distance,"" he said. ""So when I moved to Mexico, I was single and a little bit lonely, and decided to throw myself into my work."" Then he met Ms. Morrison, who threw him for a loop. ""I thought she was just this incredibly dynamic, intelligent woman,"" Mr. Shenai said. ""We clicked immediately, and spoke as if we had known each other all of our lives."" They learned they had grown up about 100 miles away from each other on opposite sides of Lake Ontario, she in Toronto and he in Rochester. They also lived a block apart in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Washington, and had several friends in common. Mr. Shenai told Ms. Morrison he thought her move to Mexico City, ""was courageous, not crazy."" ""Anyone willing to leave behind a cushy life in a developed world and move to a more uncertain place, well, there's a certain level of adventure there, a willingness to roll the dice,"" he said, ""and I found that very attractive about her."" Ms. Morrison, who would start at Goldcorp in March 2017, knew she had found someone special in Mr. Shenai. ""He was a very handsome and extremely positive person,"" she said. ""He was also very easy to talk to, someone I just wanted to be around."" When they returned to the States for a few weeks to enjoy the holidays with their families, he was all she could think about. ""I was counting the days until I saw him again,"" she said."

Dan Stout that law enforcement's handling of white supremacy was broken came in September 2017, as he was sitting in an emergency-operations center in Gainesville, Fla., preparing for the onslaught of Hurricane Irma and watching what felt like his thousandth YouTube video of the recent violence in Charlottesville, Va. Jesus Christ, he thought, studying the footage in which crowds of angry men, who had gathered to attend or protest the Unite the Right rally, set upon one another with sticks and flagpole spears and flame throwers and God knows what else. A black man held an aerosol can, igniting the spray, and in retaliation, a white man picked up his gun, pointed it toward the black man and fired it at the ground. The Virginia state troopers, inexplicably, stood by and watched. Stout fixated on this image, wondering what kind of organizational failure had led to the debacle. He had one month to ensure that the same thing didn't happen in Gainesville. Before that August, Stout, a 24-year veteran of the Gainesville police force, had never heard of Richard Spencer and knew next to nothing about his self-declared alt-right movement, or of their ""anti-fascist"" archnemesis known as Antifa. Then, on the Monday after deadly violence in Charlottesville, in which a protester was killed when a driver plowed his car into the crowd, Stout learned to his horror that Spencer was planning a speech at the University of Florida. He spent weeks frantically trying to get up to speed, scouring far-right and anti-fascist websites and videos, each click driving him further into despair. Aside from the few white nationalists who had been identified by the media or on Twitter, Stout had no clue who most of these people were, and neither, it seemed, did anyone else in law enforcement. There were no current intelligence reports he could find on the alt-right, the sometimes-violent fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist positions. The state police couldn't offer much insight. Things were equally bleak at the federal level. Whatever the F.B.I. knew (which wasn't a lot, Stout suspected), they weren't sharing. The Department of Homeland Security, which produced regular intelligence and threat assessments for local law enforcement, had only scant material on white supremacists, all of it vague and ultimately not much help. Local politicians, including the governor, were also in the dark. This is like a Bermuda Triangle of intelligence, Stout thought, incredulous. He reached out to their state partners. ""So you're telling us that there's nothing? No names we can plug into the automatic license-plate readers? No players with a propensity for violence? No one you have in the system? Nothing?'' One of those coming to Gainesville was William Fears, a 31-year-old from Houston. Fears, who online went by variations of the handle Antagonizer, was one of the most dedicated foot soldiers of the alt-right. Countless YouTube videos had captured his progress over the past year as he made his way from protest to protest across several states, flinging Nazi salutes, setting off smoke bombs and, from time to time, attacking people. Fears was also a felon. He had spent six years in prison for aggravated kidnapping in a case involving his ex-girlfriend, and now he had an active warrant for his arrest, after his new girlfriend accused him of assault less than two weeks earlier. On Oct. 18, the night before the event, Fears and a few others from Houston's white-nationalist scene got in Fears's silver Jeep Patriot for the 14-hour drive. Fears's friend Tyler TenBrink, who pleaded guilty to assault in 2014, posted video from their trip on his Facebook page. There were four men, two of them felons, and two nine-millimeter handguns. ""Texans always carry,"" Fears said later. Gainesville would be Spencer's first major public appearance since the violence of the Unite the Right rally two months before, and the city, a progressive enclave in the heart of deep-red north Florida, was on edge. Anticipating chaos, Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency — prompting Spencer to tweet out an image of his head making its way across the Atlantic toward Florida: ""Hurricane Spencer."" A few days before the event, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement sent out a small, bound ""threat book"" of about 20 or so figures, most of them openly affiliated with Spencer or with anti-fascist groups, which Stout knew from his own research meant they weren't the people to worry about. Anonymous online chatter on sites like 4chan, meanwhile, described armed right-wing militants coming to Gainesville to test Florida's Stand Your Ground law. Stout envisioned 20 white supremacists with long guns. We're screwed, he thought. By the morning of Oct. 19, a fortress of security, costing the University of Florida and police forces roughly half a million dollars, had been built around the western edge of the 2,000-acre campus and the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, where Spencer and his entourage arrived that afternoon. More than 1,100 state troopers and local cops stood on alert, with another 500 on standby. There were officers posted on rooftops. Police helicopters buzzed the skies. The Florida National Guard had been activated off-site, and a line of armored vehicles sat in reserve. Hundreds of journalists from around the United States and abroad were in attendance, anticipating another Charlottesville. Some 2,500 protesters had descended on the small area cordoned off for the event, where they confronted a handful of white supremacists, most of them Spencer groupies like Fears and his friends. ""Basically, I'm just fed up with the fact that I'm cisgendered, I'm a white male and I lean right, toward the Republican side, and I get demonized,"" Colton Fears, Will's 28-year-old brother, who was wearing an SS pin, told HuffPost. TenBrink, also 28, told The Washington Post that he had come to support Spencer because after Charlottesville, where he was seen and photographed, he had been threatened by the ""radical left."" He seemed agitated by the thousands of protesters. ""This is a mess,"" he told The Gainesville Sun. ""It appears that the only answer left is violence, and nobody wants that."" But Will Fears told reporters he came to Gainesville to intimidate the protesters. ""It's always been socially acceptable to punch a Nazi, to attack people if they have right-wing political leanings,"" he said. ""We're starting to push back."" He went on: ""We want to show our teeth a little bit because, you know, we're not to be taken lightly."" The Spencer speech turned out to be a bust, thanks to an audience so determined to drown him out that at one point they erupted in a chant of ""Orange! Blue! Orange! Blue!"" as if at a Gators football game. Afterward, the crowd left the auditorium and flooded back onto Hull Road, the long avenue leading toward the center of campus. Thousands of protesters surrounded the small group of Spencer acolytes. TenBrink, a sinewy young man wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, was particularly overwhelmed and jumped a barricade to escape the angry crowd. The police put him in handcuffs and escorted him into a parking garage. Then, for reasons that remain unclear, they uncuffed TenBrink and walked him out of the garage and toward the parking lot, and let him go. Neither TenBrink nor his friends were in the threat book. There are several versions of what happened after TenBrink was released. It was about 5:15 p.m. The Texans drove down Archer Avenue, the broad street bordering the south edge of campus, about a mile from the secured area. A group of protesters were sitting at a bus stop. The men in the Jeep started shouting ""Heil Hitler!"" according to the police report and several witness statements. ""Do you know my friend Heil? Heil Hitler? Get it?"" The men started throwing Nazi salutes. One of the protesters had come to Gainesville armed with a retractable baton. When the Texans began to harass them, he grabbed his baton and struck a window of the S.U.V. ""My life and the lives of those around me was at risk,"" he told the police. Will Fears jumped out. ""I'm about to beat this dude up with his own fricking expandable baton,"" he later recalled. Suddenly, witnesses said, a man later identified as TenBrink jumped from the vehicle holding a handgun. ""Shoot them!"" the Texans were heard yelling. TenBrink pointed the gun at the protester. White supremacists and other far-right extremists have killed far more people since Sept. 11, 2001, than any other category of domestic extremist. The Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism has reported that 71 percent of the extremist-related fatalities in the United States between 2008 and 2017 were committed by members of the far right or white-supremacist movements. Islamic extremists were responsible for just 26 percent. Data compiled by the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database shows that the number of terror-related incidents has more than tripled in the United States since 2013, and the number of those killed has quadrupled. In 2017, there were 65 incidents totaling 95 deaths. In a recent analysis of the data by the news site Quartz, roughly 60 percent of those incidents were driven by racist, anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, antigovernment or other right-wing ideologies. Left-wing ideologies, like radical environmentalism, were responsible for 11 attacks. Muslim extremists committed just seven attacks. These statistics belie the strident rhetoric around ""foreign-born"" terrorists that the Trump administration has used to drive its anti-immigration agenda. They also raise questions about the United States' counterterrorism strategy, which for nearly two decades has been focused almost exclusively on American and foreign-born jihadists, overshadowing right-wing extremism as a legitimate national-security threat. According to a recent report by the nonpartisan Stimson Center, between 2002 and 2017, the United States spent $2.8 trillion — 15 percent of discretionary spending — on counterterrorism. Terrorist attacks by Muslim extremists killed 100 people in the United States during that time. Between 2008 and 2017, domestic extremists killed 387 in the United States, according to the 2018 Anti-Defamation League report. ""We're actually seeing all the same phenomena of what was happening with groups like ISIS, same tactics, but no one talks about it because it's far-right extremism,"" says the national-security strategist P. W. Singer, a senior fellow at the New America think tank. During the first year of the Trump administration, Singer and a colleague met with a group of senior administration officials about building a counterterrorism strategy that encompassed a wider range of threats. ""They only wanted to talk about Muslim extremism,"" he says. But even before the Trump administration, he says, ""we willingly turned the other way on white supremacy because there were real political costs to talking about white supremacy."" In March 2018, a 20-year-old white evangelical Christian named Mark Anthony Conditt laid a series of homemade I.E.D.s around Austin, Tex., in largely minority communities. The bombs killed two African-Americans and injured at least four others over the course of several weeks, terrorizing the city, yet the local authorities preferred to describe Conditt, who committed suicide, as a ""very challenged young man."" Also last spring, another white man, 28-year-old Benjamin Morrow, blew himself up in his apartment in Beaver Dam, Wis., while apparently constructing a bomb. Federal investigators said Morrow's apartment doubled as a ""homemade explosives laboratory."" There was a trove of white-supremacist literature in Morrow's home, according to the F.B.I. But local cops, citing Morrow's clean-cut demeanor and standout record as a quality-control manager at a local food-processing plant, made sure to note that just because he had this material didn't mean he was a white supremacist. ""He could have been an individual that was doing research,"" the local police chief said. In this atmosphere of apparent indifference on the part of government officials and law enforcement, a virulent, and violent, far-right movement has grown and metastasized. To combat it, some officials have suggested prosecuting related crimes through expansion of the government's counterterrorism powers — creating a special ""domestic terrorism"" statute, for instance, which currently doesn't exist. But a report released on Oct. 31 by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School argues that the creation of such a statute could easily be abused to target ""protesters and political dissidents instead of terrorists,"" and that law enforcement already has ample authority to prosecute domestic terrorism: ""Congress must require that counterterrorism resource decisions be based on objective evaluations of the physical harm different groups pose to human life, rather than on political considerations that prioritize the safety of some communities over others."" The report also calls out the Justice Department for its ""blind spot"" when it comes to domestic terrorism and hate crimes, which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein conceded earlier in the week. During a conference on Oct. 29, Rosenstein said that according to the latest F.B.I. crime report, ""88 percent of agencies that provide hate-crimes data to the F.B.I. reported zero hate crimes in 2016."" The Justice Department was reviewing the accuracy of the reports, he noted. ""Simply because hate crimes are not reported does not mean they are not happening."" In 2016, the latest full year of data available from the F.B.I., more than 6,100 hate-crime incidents were reported, 4,270 of them crimes against people (as opposed to, say, defacing property). And yet only 27 federal hate-crime defendants were prosecuted that year. ""The F.B.I. knows how many bank robberies there were last year,"" says Michael German, an author of the Brennan Center report and a former F.B.I. agent, ""but it doesn't know how many white supremacists attacked people, how many they injured or killed."" More concerning to German, though, is that law enforcement seems uninterested in policing the violent far right. During the first year after Donald Trump's election, protests and riots erupted across the country, often involving men with criminal histories who, by definition, were on the law-enforcement radar. During the so-called Battle of Berkeley in March 2017, for instance, a far-right agitator named Kyle Chapman became a hero to the alt-right after he reportedly pummeled an anti-fascist counterprotester with a billy club. Chapman was a 41-year-old who had two previous felony convictions. He proceeded to travel around the country, engaging in violence at other protests, now under the online moniker Based Stickman — a cheerful reference to the Berkeley attacks. Chapman was one of a number of known white supremacists to align with the Proud Boys, a nationalist men's movement founded in 2016 by the anti-immigrant ""Western chauvinist"" Gavin McInnes, a founder of Vice Media. There was also the Rise Above Movement (RAM), an alt-right group composed largely of ex-cons, many with ties to Southern California's racist skinhead movement. Over the past two years, each group engaged in violent confrontations with their ideological enemies — a lengthy list including African-Americans, Jews, Muslims, nonwhite immigrants, members of the L.G.B.T. community and the progressive left — and generally escaped punishment. This changed to a degree over the past few weeks when, after a yearlong campaign by journalists at ProPublica and other media outlets, federal prosecutors filed charges against eight members of RAM, including two of its leaders. Similarly, after a pressure campaign on social media, the New York Police Department arrested and charged six members of the Proud Boys in connection with an assault after a speech by McInnes at a Republican club in Manhattan on Oct. 12. On his podcast, McInnes noted that he has ""a lot of support"" in the N.Y.P.D. (The police commissioner denies this.) In at least one instance, the police have in fact coordinated with far-right groups. In 2017, a law-enforcement official stationed at a rally in downtown Portland, Ore., turned to a member of a far-right militia group and asked for his assistance in cuffing a left-wing counterprotester, who had been tackled by a Proud Boy. ""This is what public demonstration looks like in an era when white nationalism isn't on the fringes, but on the inside of the political mainstream,"" says Brian Levin, a former New York City police officer who now leads the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino. During the run-up to some of last year's major events in places like Charlottesville or Berkeley, he notes, ""there was an unending stream of violent themed chatter and an almost choreographed exchange of web threats between antagonists across wide geographic expanses"" that earned barely a nod from law enforcement. During a congressional hearing in the wake of Charlottesville, Christopher Wray, director of the F.B.I., told lawmakers last September that the bureau had ""about 1,000"" open domestic-terror investigations, roughly the same number of investigations the bureau had open on ISIS. The bureau has not provided information on how many of those investigations pertained to white nationalists or other far-right extremists, as opposed to left-wing or ""black-identity extremist"" groups, nor whether they are full-blown investigations, preliminary inquiries or ""assessments."" The F.B.I. has also responded to criticism that it has failed to address hateful or threatening messages on social media. The F.B.I. said in a statement: ""The F.B.I. does not and cannot police ideologies under the First Amendment."" But looking at prosecutions, German says, ""it's clear that many of the people targeted for investigation for allegedly supporting the Islamic State were initially identified because of something they said online."" There are serious civil liberties concerns with any broad surveillance of social media, German says. What's also true, he notes, is that the volume of white-supremacist-related content is overwhelmingly high. ""There are relatively few Americans voicing their support for ISIS online. But there are millions of racists, anti-Semites, Islamophobes, homophobes and xenophobes who engage in eliminationist rhetoric about the communities of people they fear and hate every day on social media and radio talk shows. Even if the F.B.I. wanted to monitor this hate speech, they wouldn't have the resources, or any way to distinguish between those who talk and those who act."" Levin believes that the Justice Department could be more flexible in pursuing these groups without violating First Amendment concerns. Just as they do with ISIS supporters, law-enforcement agencies would be within their legal rights to monitor, analyze and share any of the publicly available intelligence on white supremacists or hate groups that suggests violent confrontations. ""The problem is not that we rightly scrutinize violent Salafist extremism,"" Levin says, ""but that we do so while materially ignoring domestic white nationalists or those on their fringes who also represent a violent threat."" When we first spoke this August, Levin noted the continued ascendance of the far right, even after many of its members went underground after Charlottesville. ""The rocket ship is still twirling,"" he said. Levin predicted that the next big wave of activity wouldn't be around mega-rallies but around what he calls ""aggressive maneuvers"" by loners or small cells. A series of violent outbursts in a single week in October made his prediction seem prescient. In just seven days, a Florida man who lived out of a van plastered with stickers, including one of Hillary Clinton's face in cross hairs, is reported to have sent a series of pipe bombs to at least a dozen of Trump's critics. Two days after the first package appeared, a middle-aged white man, having tried unsuccessfully to break into a black church near Louisville, Ky., reportedly shot and killed two elderly African-Americans at a Kroger. ""Whites don't kill whites,"" the man reportedly told an armed white man who confronted him. Then, at week's end, a man who posted on Gab, the alt-right's preferred social-media site, about a ""kike infestation"" interrupted services at the Tree of Life synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and several handguns; he was charged with murdering 11 people and injuring several more, including police officers. The Anti-Defamation League believed it to be the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history. Law enforcement's inability to reckon with the far right is a problem that goes back generations in this country, and the roots of this current crisis can be traced back more than a decade. With violent political messaging emanating from the White House and echoed throughout the conservative media and social-media landscapes, Levin only expects more attacks. ""What we need to worry about is the guy who is riled up by this rhetoric and decides to go out and do something on his own,"" he told me in August. ""We have people who are ticking time bombs."" In April 2009, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis issued a report warning of a rise in ""right-wing extremism."" The department is the country's largest law-enforcement body, created after Sept. 11 to prevent and respond to various threats, most specifically those connected to terrorism. While most of its counterterrorism focus has been on preventing Islamist terrorist attacks, the department is also supposed to examine domestic threats, like those coming from violent white supremacists, antigovernment militants and single-issue hate groups, like radical anti-abortion activists. The author of the report was a senior intelligence analyst named Daryl Johnson, who ran a small Homeland Security domestic-terrorism unit. Two years earlier, in January 2007, Johnson was sitting in his bland second-floor office when he received a call from a contact at the Capitol Police. A first-term Illinois senator named Barack Obama was planning to announce that he was running for president. ""Curious if you've heard any threatening chatter,"" the officer said. This was the first time Johnson had heard of Obama, and he didn't know about any threats, but that didn't mean there wouldn't be any. Though white-extremist groups had been fairly quiet in the years since Sept. 11, Johnson saw this as a temporary lull. These people never truly went away, he thought; they just needed the right motivation to energize them. ""What do you think's going to happen when the Ku Klux Klan and the neo-Nazis and other white supremacists get wind of this?"" the officer asked. Johnson didn't skip a beat: ""I think it's going to be the perfect recruiting and radicalization tool for white supremacy."" At 38, Johnson spoke with the earnestness of an Eagle Scout, which he was. He was also a registered Republican who grew up in a small Mormon community in rural Virginia where millennialism, or end-times theology, was a core concept. During the 1980s, when Johnson was still in high school, far-right separatists took to the Ozarks or to strongholds in rural Idaho, where they stockpiled food and weapons and conducted paramilitary training in preparation for the biblical ""last days."" Some, like the Aryan Nations, whose members embraced the racist Christian Identity philosophy, spawned domestic terror cells like the Order, which waged a brutal campaign of bombings, armed robberies and murder, culminating with the June 1984 assassination of Alan Berg, the prominent Jewish radio talk-show host who frequently spoke of flushing out the latent anti-Semitism in Denver's conservative community. Years of law-enforcement investigation and infiltration of right-wing terror groups commenced, and by the early 1990s, many of the movement's most violent members were dead or in jail. But the government standoffs at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Tex., energized a new generation of separatists, Patriot militias — the forerunners of today's antigovernment militia groups — as well as individuals like Timothy McVeigh, who made his way through various antigovernment and racist ideologies and organizations under the radar of law enforcement, before the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. The deaths of 168 people, including 19 children, at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building brought the threat of domestic terrorism by white Americans into stark relief. In the aftermath, the F.B.I. added many more agents to work domestic terrorism cases, and Attorney General Janet Reno created a special task force to investigate domestic terrorism. But by the end of 2001, the dominant business of the F.B.I., as well as every other federal law enforcement body, was international terrorism. Years after the Sept. 11 attacks, the supposed threat posed by Al Qaeda and other Muslim groups continued to drive policy, notably at the Department of Homeland Security, which Johnson, who started his career in Army intelligence, joined in 2005. At the time, he later recalled, he was the only analyst exclusively working on non-Islamic domestic threats. By 2007, he had put together a small team of analysts who began to scour extremist websites and message boards. What they found alarmed them. The militant far right was enjoying a renaissance, thanks to the internet. Hundreds of militia recruitment and paramilitary training videos had sprung up on YouTube, along with promotions for weapons training and, to Johnson's horror, bomb-making manuals. Between October 2007 and March 2008, Johnson and his unit documented the formation of 45 new antigovernment militia groups, which he saw as highly significant given that before fall 2007, these sorts of groups had been on the decline. Some white-supremacist groups, seizing upon the anti-immigration rhetoric that was then fomenting, created violent video games aimed at exploiting public fear of ""illegals"" streaming over the border. By the spring of 2008, Obama's candidacy, just as Johnson predicted, had become a lightning rod for white supremacists and other hate groups. As the campaign moved into its final months, law-enforcement agencies intercepted at least two assassination plots against Obama. Other threats and racist posts flooded the internet, where Johnson's team noticed a sharp increase in membership on Stormfront, the first major white-nationalist website. The site added 32,000 new users within the first three months after Obama's inauguration, nearly double the number it added in 2008. Johnson and his team compiled their findings into a report, which they were still working on when Obama tapped Janet Napolitano, formerly the governor of Arizona, as the new secretary of Homeland Security. Napolitano ""got it"" when it came to white supremacy, says Juliette Kayyem, who served as the department's assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs in 2009 and 2010. While serving as Arizona's attorney general, Napolitano coordinated the investigation of one of Timothy McVeigh's accomplices. Now, concerned that a reinvigorated white-supremacist movement could pose a threat to the country's first African-American president and to citizens, Napolitano began asking her intelligence analysts about a rise in lone-wolf ""right-wing extremism,"" a term commonly used in the counterterrorism world to refer to the radical beliefs of fringe players on the right of the political spectrum. In March 2009, Johnson says he and a few colleagues from the F.B.I. briefed Napolitano on their findings, theorizing that heightened stress because of the continuing financial crisis, coupled with the election of the first black president, created a ""unique driver"" for individual radicalization and antigovernment and white-supremacist recruitment. Military veterans, including those returning after multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, might be particularly susceptible candidates, they noted, a prediction based on a 2008 F.B.I. assessment that found 203 individuals with military experience who had joined white-supremacist groups since Sept. 11, 2001. It was a tiny number given the overall United States veteran population, which at the time was close to 24 million. It was also a small percentage of the thousands of white supremacists the F.B.I. estimated were active. But the ""prestige"" that those with military or tactical skills held within white-supremacist groups made their influence much greater, the F.B.I. argued. Johnson remembers Napolitano, sitting at the conference table, soberly flipping through the PowerPoint slides and thanking the analysts for the presentation. A few days later, the Department of Homeland Security released its report, ""Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment,"" which was distributed across the government and local law-enforcement agencies. On April 11, 2009, four days after his report was released, Johnson was at home in West Virginia when a PDF of the document was posted on the website of the syndicated conservative radio host Roger Hedgecock. A link to the PDF was also posted on a blog maintained by the Oath Keepers, the antigovernment group composed of numerous law-enforcement officials. ""FORWARD THIS TO EVERY AMERICAN!"" read the post, which Johnson suspected had been written by a member of the law-enforcement community. ""YOU are now a dangerous terrorist according to the Obama administration."" By the next day, news of a ""chilling"" report from the department was making its way through far-right message boards and the blogosphere, where it was picked apart by conspiracy sites like Infowars, which deemed it evidence of a deep-state plot. More mainstream right-wing pundits like Michelle Malkin considered it, in Malkin's words, an ""Obama D.H.S. hit job"" on conservatives. Some progressives also had concerns about the report's ""dangerously vague and speculative"" nature, as a Mother Jones correspondent, James Ridgeway, wrote, warning that ""civil libertarians of all stripes"" should be nervous and raising the specter of government surveillance. From the perspective of many people inside the department, the report was ""exactly what the department is supposed to do, which is inform and educate our stakeholders about what we see as a threat,"" Kayyem says. ""This was not a political document."" Congressional Republicans, answering to a nascent Tea Party movement and the American Legion, soon took issue with the label ""right-wing extremism,"" which John Boehner, then minority leader of the House, charged was being used by the Department of Homeland Security ""to describe American citizens who disagree with the direction Washington Democrats are taking our nation."" Boehner was particularly bothered by the report's mention of veterans. ""To characterize men and women returning home after defending our country as potential terrorists is offensive and unacceptable,"" he said in a statement. Several G.O.P. lawmakers called for Napolitano's resignation, as well as that of Johnson, who, in their view, equated conservatives with terrorists. Johnson was appalled. ""I never anticipated such an aggressive, vile backlash,"" he told me recently. It was puzzling: Just a few months before his April 2009 report was published, the department released an assessment of the cyber threat posed by ""left-wing extremists,"" like the Earth Liberation Front and the Animal Liberation Front. Legislators, the media and the public at large — including progressives — had no objection to that terminology. But the political firestorm over ""right-wing extremism"" had caused such an uproar that the Department of Homeland Security ultimately avoided using ideological terminology like ""right-wing."" A few weeks after the report was released, Napolitano formally apologized to veterans, and after intense pressure from veterans' groups, the department withdrew the report. Afterward, the administration tried to depoliticize the issue. Obama had been elected promising to improve relations with the Muslim world, though this soon provided an opening for conspiracy-minded Republicans like Representative Louie Gohmert, the Texas congressman who once insinuated that Mohamed Elibiary, an adviser to Obama's national-security team, was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. During the Bush administration, the word ""terrorism"" had become almost synonymous with Islam. Now, as one former policy adviser recalls, ""the Obama people were adamant that it couldn't just be about jihadis."" They adopted a new, less ideological lexicon. Terrorism became ""violent extremism,"" which suggested behavior. The administration also came up with a new paradigm of ""ideologically motivated violence"" that ostensibly could apply to any form of extremism, not just Islamic terrorism. The Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department would develop ""countering violent extremism"" programs that focused on outreach and community engagement, not warrantless surveillance, though in practice they were still an effort to identify and root out jihadist elements from American Muslim communities, just as they had been during the Bush administration. At the same time, most of the work exclusively focused on domestic extremism stopped at the Department of Homeland Security. ""I blame an entire political apparatus led by Republicans that made calling something 'right-wing extremism' a political statement,"" says Kayyem, who notes the paradox of G.O.P. leaders' attacking Democrats for refusing to use the phrase ""radical Islamic extremism."" ""They'd say if you can't say it, you can't fight it,"" she says. ""But it cuts both ways. If you're not allowed to say that white supremacy is a form of radicalization, then how are you going to stop it?"" Johnson's 2009 report proved prescient. In February 2011, the Southern Poverty Law Center said that in the previous year, the number of domestic hate groups in the United States had reached more than 1,000 for the first time. The antigovernment Patriot movement gained 300 new groups over the same time period, a jump of over 60 percent. Every sphere of the far right was being energized at the same time. There was also an uptick in so-called lone wolves, who held extremist views but associated with no specific organization. In May 2010, a year after Johnson's report was released, a father and son from Ohio, members of a little-known antigovernment movement called ""sovereign citizens,"" shot and killed two police officers during a traffic stop in West Memphis, Ark. It was the 12th attack or foiled plot by white-extremist ""lone wolves"" since 2009, almost all of which received little publicity. The United States attorney from Western Arkansas, Conner Eldridge, was one of a number of Justice Department prosecutors who felt the department had given short shrift to domestic terrorism. Quietly, Eldridge began to network with United States attorneys from states with a history of white-supremacist activity. They pressed the Justice Department for more resources. ""Our thesis was, hey, let's focus on domestic terrorism at an equal level as we're focusing on international terrorism, because they're both terrorism,"" Eldridge told me recently. ""But we consistently confronted, at every level, a sort of lack of attention to domestic terrorism. The day-to-day focus was on the next potential ISIS attack."" Back in Washington, weeks would go by with the daily national threat briefings rarely if ever discussing possible domestic threats from the far right. At the F.B.I., counterterrorism agents candidly admitted that domestic terrorism was seen as a backwater and that the only path to advancement was through international terrorism cases. In a recent report on law enforcement's evaluation of Muslim versus right-wing extremism, a team of researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, noted that in 2008 and 2009 — the only years for which figures were made public — fewer than 350 of the F.B.I.'s 2,000 counterterrorism agents were assigned to domestic terrorism. After a series of violent attacks by white supremacists, including on a Jewish community center and a nearby retirement home in Overland Park, Kan., Attorney General Eric Holder announced in 2014 that he was reconvening the Justice Department's Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee. The group hadn't met in 13 years. ""It wasn't the same as it had been before, but it was something,"" says Eldridge, who was tapped to head the committee, which included representatives from about 15 law-enforcement agencies and five Justice Department divisions, including the F.B.I. and the U.S. Marshals. ""But we had no budget, no staff, and we had no person whose sole job was to run the committee."" The ceaseless focus on ISIS and Al Qaeda filtered down to local law enforcement. The administration's much-touted ""countering violent extremism"" agenda was directed at various threats. But ""the language heavily focused on recruitment and radicalization by ISIS and Al Qaeda,"" recalls Nate Snyder, a counterterrorism adviser to the Obama administration at the Department of Homeland Security from 2009 through 2017. As early as 2010, he says, his office was receiving calls from police officers asking for help in many Southern and Midwestern states. ""They'd be like, 'Thanks for that stuff on Al Qaeda, but what I really need to know is how to handle the Hammerskin population in my jurisdiction,' "" he says, referring to the white-supremacist skinhead group. In 2011, the White House described the threat of Al Qaeda and its affiliates as the ""pre-eminent security threat to our country."" By 2013, a new threat had emerged: so-called homegrown violent extremists, or H.V.E.s, a category of people who, though born in the United States, were inspired by a nondomestic ideology to commit violence. H.V.E.s, who tended to be Muslim, were not to be mistaken for domestic terrorists, who by definition were not only Americans but also driven by a domestic ideology like white supremacy. And yet the two were often conflated, and therefore ""homegrowns"" were also perceived as domestic terrorists: the Tsarnaev brothers, responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013; the perpetrators of the San Bernardino massacre or the mass shooting at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando. Dylann Roof, born in South Carolina, whose homegrown racism was nurtured on neo-Nazi websites like The Daily Stormer, was not, in this context, a domestic terrorist, nor were any of his beliefs seen as indicative of ""violent extremism."" His shooting spree in a church in Charleston, in which he killed nine African-Americans, was interpreted as something else. What drove him, authorities said, was hate. He was a murderer. This dichotomy plagued Representative Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who served as ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee. For years, Thompson pressed both the administration and fellow members of Congress to be more outspoken on domestic terrorism. ""The silence was almost deafening when it came to raising any of those issues in Congress,"" he says. ""And the administration had this do-nothing approach. They kept telling us, well, we see that white supremacy is a problem, but there's no way we can get ourselves involved in this because they won't talk to us."" It was a curious response from an administration whose ""C.V.E."" agenda supposedly addressed all types of ideologically motivated violence. ""I really suspect they did some polling and found out that there were certain things an African-American president couldn't talk about,"" one former adviser said. ""I think they didn't want to poke the bear."" This approach was most evident with Obama's second Homeland Security chief, Jeh Johnson, who came to the department in 2013, after a three-year sojourn as general counsel to the Defense Department, where he provided legal authority for the drone-strike program. During Johnson's tenure, Nate Snyder says, his office received calls from evangelical pastors worried about far-right recruitment in their congregations. There was also concern about reports of white supremacy in the military. Johnson, who told me that fear of another ISIS-style attack kept him up at night, held regular round tables with imams and other members of the Islamic community. He resisted the pressure from some members of his staff, and some in Congress, like Thompson, to make similar overtures to communities concerned about antigovernment or white-supremacist groups. He thought it would be absurd to hold round tables with sovereign citizens and white supremacists. ""I didn't think that would have been a very effective use of my time to try,"" he told me. Johnson never called Dylann Roof a domestic terrorist, a phrase commonly applied to Timothy McVeigh. ""If there was ever an opportunity to define white extremists as domestic terrorists, Dylann Roof was it,"" Snyder says. ""But people went back and forth, and it went down the same careful deliberation that happens with active shooters: Maybe it was a mental-health issue. Maybe he was 'disturbed.' Maybe he had a predisposition to violence."" When I spoke to Johnson, he felt it was not his place to call Roof a terrorist. There isn't a crime of ""domestic terrorism"" to charge someone with. ""There is a certain type of violent extremism that is by nature more of a matter for law enforcement, and another that is about engaging communities at the local level,"" he said. But the country's chief law-enforcement official at the time, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, also didn't call Roof a terrorist — though she did note that his mass shooting, which she was prosecuting as a hate crime, seemed to meet the definition of terrorism. ""Hate crimes are the original domestic terrorism,"" she said. James Comey, then director of the F.B.I., wasn't sure. Terrorism, he stated in June 2015, was ""more of a political act,"" and he didn't see the Charleston shooting as political. Even after a racist manifesto Roof penned surfaced online stating his intent to ""protect the white race"" by instigating a race war, Comey still wasn't sure it met the definition. ""I only operate in a legal framework,"" he told HuffPost. The refusal to name the attack as ""terrorism"" was, in some critics' eyes, a crucial misstep that would have far broader implications. ""I was very pleased when the Obama administration started and said, We're not going to use the phrase 'war on terror,' "" says Erroll Southers, a former F.B.I. agent and now director of the Safe Communities Institute at the University of Southern California. ""I think the Obama people decided, O.K., we're not going to call it 'terrorism,' thinking it was a good thing. The problem was they didn't realize how much it emboldened the other side and gave them political cover."" In the months following Donald Trump's inauguration, security analysts noted with increasing alarm what seemed to be a systematic erosion of the Department of Homeland Security's analytic and operational capabilities with regard to countering violent extremism. It began with the appointment of a new national-security team. Like their counterparts now running immigration policy, the team came from the fringe of conservative politics, some of them with connections to Islamophobic think tanks and organizations like ACT for America or the Center for Security Policy, whose founder, Frank Gaffney, was Washington's most prominent peddler of anti-Muslim conspiracy theories. In addition to Gaffney, whose biased and statistically flawed data on the ""Muslim threat"" became the premise for Trump's so-called Muslim ban, there were other ideological fellow travelers like Sebastian and Katharine Gorka, the husband-and-wife national-security team. Sebastian Gorka became a senior White House adviser, and Katharine Gorka became a senior adviser to the Department of Homeland Security. During the transition, Sebastian Gorka predicted the demise of ""C.V.E.,"" which he suggested was a fuzzy, politically correct approach to a problem — terrorism — that needed a better fix. Shortly afterward, Katharine Gorka, who once criticized the Obama administration for ""allowing Islamists to dictate national-security policy,"" made it clear, Nate Snyder recalls, that she didn't like the phrase ""countering violent extremism."" From now on, the mission would be focused on ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" the White House's go-to phrase, which, as Sebastian Gorka later explained, was intended to ""jettison the political correctness of the last eight years."" A surreal scene, replicated in nearly every department and agency, soon began to play out inside the Department of Homeland Security. George Selim, a longtime national-security expert in both the Bush and Obama administrations who headed the Office of Community Partnerships, which worked with local government and civic groups on C.V.E. efforts, noted that as the months passed, ""it was clear that there were fewer and fewer of the career civil servants at the table for critical policy decisions."" Some political appointees seemed to have virtually no experience with the issues they had been tapped to advise on. Katharine Gorka, as her own LinkedIn biography notes, had never held a public-sector job before joining the department, nor did she seem to have any practical experience in national security, or law enforcement, or intelligence. Another new senior Homeland Security official, the retired Navy officer Frank Wuco, had made a career of lecturing to the military about the jihadi mind-set, often while role-playing as a member of the Taliban in a Pashtun hat and kaffiyeh. ""That's who was trying to tell me he understands the threat,"" an official said dryly. By February 2017, after the Trump administration issued its first executive order trying to ban citizens of Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, several American Muslim groups decided to reject federal C.V.E. grant money they were awarded under the Obama administration out of concern over the new administration's framing of the issue. That March, the White House froze the $10 million the previous administration had allotted for the grants, pending review. While that review was underway, the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. issued a joint intelligence bulletin, dated May 10, warning that white supremacists might pose ""a threat of lethal violence"" over the next year. The report, which some analysts said reflected a fraction of the actual numbers, said that white supremacists ""were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any other domestic extremist movement."" At the end of June, the Department of Homeland Security withheld grant money from several previously approved applicants whose focus was on studying extremists' online networks and helping both white supremacists and Muslim extremists leave their movements. Though the total budget for C.V.E. was minuscule given the department's overall grant budget, rejecting those programs nonetheless produced ""a real chilling effect,"" as one policy analyst recalls. Some researchers withdrew from plans to brief lawmakers on far-right extremism. In July 2017, Selim tendered his resignation. Not long afterward, a senior official on the interagency task force running C.V.E. efforts withdrew. More departures followed. The Department of Homeland Security renamed the Office of Community Partnerships the Office of Terrorism Prevention Partnerships. At the department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, analysts specifically looking at domestic terrorism and coordinating with local law enforcement were reassigned as public-affairs liaisons, Snyder says. ""So no one is looking at the intelligence and connecting the dots, which is what the Department of Homeland Security was created to do."" In the lingo of the counterterrorism world, the department's responsibility is anything ""left of boom,"" meaning all the pre-emptive steps that might prevent an attack, from securing the borders to synthesizing and sharing intelligence to working with community leaders and local law enforcement to help them better identify risks. Today, at least for the federal government, Snyder says ""left of boom is dead."" William Fears was born in 1987 and spent his childhood in Jasper, Tex., a tiny and deeply segregated town about 130 miles northeast of Houston. East Texas is Klan country, and Jasper holds a notable spot in the racist history of the region as the town where, in 1998, when Fears was 10, three white men lynched a black man named James Byrd Jr., chaining him to the back of a truck and dragging him to death. Early in his life, Fears, searching for identity, cycled through a long list of ideologies. He was 14 on Sept. 11, 2001, old enough to absorb the patriotic fervor of that moment but too young to enlist. For a year or two, he was a Michael Moore-style populist, having been ""red-pilled on 'Bowling for Columbine.' "" Then, having spent a great deal of his spare time stoned and watching YouTube, Fears embraced the Sept. 11 ""truthers"" movement. As he spent more and more time on sites like Infowars, he was exposed to notions that the government, backed by the Illumi-nati, the globalists, the Freemasons — Jews, but not ""the Jews"" as he would later come to see them — had blown up the towers, crashed the financial markets and plunged the country into economic crisis. This led to his next great obsession: the candidacy of the G.O.P. presidential hopeful Ron Paul, a libertarian who had amassed a large grass-roots following of what The New York Times then called ""iconoclastic white men."" But Fears eventually grew bored with Paul, just as he had grown bored with Michael Moore, and it was in this state of vague political disillusionment, and heavy drug use, that Fears kidnapped a former girlfriend in 2009 and stabbed her in the face, legs and neck before she managed to escape. In 2010, he was sentenced to seven years in prison. Fears doesn't like to talk much about his sojourn in the Texas state-prison system, though like many young men who went from the penitentiary to the far right, he was introduced to the basic tenets of white supremacy there. ""White guys got to stick together,"" he says, referring to an admitted friendship with members of the Texas branch of the Aryan Brotherhood, one of the most notoriously brutal white-supremacist gangs in the country. But he dropped those friendships after prison, he insists. ""I didn't like the whole Nazi skinhead thing with tattoos on their face and beating up minorities for no reason,"" he says, implying that they represented an earlier generation: ""They're like 1.0s."" Six years later, Fears was paroled and emerged from prison drug-free but otherwise largely the same. He was still a conspiracy theorist, though he was less obsessed with the government, his friend John Canales noticed when they reconnected that summer. ""Now it was all about the Jews,"" Canales says. At home in the Houston suburb of Pasadena, Fears submerged himself in what to him was the new, hyperconnected world of the internet, where every YouTube video he watched algorithmically directed him to others with increasingly far-right political agendas. He was fascinated by men like Richard Spencer, who fashioned himself as the second coming of George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party. He was also intrigued by Donald Trump, the troubadour of a new generation of angry white men, the alt-right movement — white supremacy 2.0 — with its in-jokes and symbols that were mostly lost on U.S. law enforcement. Fears believed in the power of memes, though alt-right memes, while dripping in irony, were also, in essence, hate speech, part of a propaganda war arguably intended to spread terror just as much as any ISIS execution video. Fears, his friend Canales says, was one of the first people Canales knew to understand this and promote the memes as broadly as he could, standing on street corners and ""sieg heil-ing"" at passers-by or waving a swastika-laden Pepe the Frog sign reading ""Free Helicopter Rides,"" an allusion to the murder of political enemies, notably leftists. In December 2016, less than six months after getting out of prison, Fears went to his first Richard Spencer event, on the campus of Texas A&M. More so-called free-speech events followed, where young white men in red MAGA hats and polo shirts descended upon college campuses or progressive enclaves in otherwise blood-red states: a clean-cut Trumpian army, marching in formation or hurling insults at activists who, outraged by their very presence, would try to fight them. Sometimes the police would intervene, or not. Fears, for one, always felt safe with the police in Texas, though he said ""they work for ZOG"" — the so-called Zionist Occupied Government. ""They'll take their paycheck over the country."" Cops would stand watch at events, sometimes on horseback, and while they might not have been ideologically aligned with the alt-right, they still tolerated them. Fears said the cops were far less forgiving of Antifa, a catchall term that has been used to describe dedicated anti-fascists and so-called anarchist extremists, as well as animal rights activists, immigration rights activists, members of the local Socialist movement, environmental protesters like those who had recently been blasted by water cannons and rubber bullets at Standing Rock, and Black Lives Matter supporters, whose protests have been met by dozens of cops in riot gear, as well as sometimes members of a paramilitary support unit. One Houston activist, who went to high school with Fears, recalls a rally where the police posed for pictures with members of the alt-right. ""Very buddy-buddy,"" he says. The same essential scenario played out across the country. At a rally in Sacramento in June 2016 organized by the white-supremacist Traditionalist Worker Party, a throng of counterprotesters showed up. ""The police didn't step in really at all,"" a police observer and representative of the National Lawyers Guild later told The Sacramento Bee. ""They basically just let people do what they wanted to do,"" the observer said. ""In this case, someone made a decision just to let them fight it out."" Ten people were hospitalized, at least five for stabbing wounds and other lacerations, most of them left-wing counterprotesters, some of whom were later charged with assault. Only one white supremacist was arrested, though court records originally acquired by The Guardian mentioned at least four T.W.P.-affiliated men who came armed with knives to the rally but were not charged. ""We're looking at you as a victim,"" an investigator with the California Highway Patrol reportedly assured a member of the T.W.P. after the rally. One domestic-terrorism expert who conducts hate-crimes training for law enforcement was baffled by the pushback she received from police officers who didn't seem to view white-supremacist groups as a law-enforcement problem. ""They'd say things like, 'Why aren't you calling Black Lives Matter or Antifa a hate group?' The answer is, because they're not hate groups! But they didn't see it that way."" It was in this atmosphere that Fears made his progress through various protests. He traveled to Charlottesville with a backpack of dystopian gear: goggles, gloves and a helmet, though he disguised himself as a Trump supporter in a suit. It was war. It was also fun. By the summer of 2017, the media had begun to cover more far-right events, leading more people to show up in protest, which furthered the right's victimization narrative, which in turn led to more events and more violence, all of which was packaged into neat selling points for a movement whose actual real-life followers may have been far fewer than they appeared. A person's willingness to brawl was a point of pride. Some of the most ardent fighters, many of them felons, became celebrities in their own right, offered speaking slots at rallies, where their V.I.P. status earned them police protection. The Rise Above Movement, led in part by a gang member who had gone to prison for an attack, turned beat-downs into an art form, which they promoted on YouTube, drawing recruits. Nathan Damigo, a former Marine who was incarcerated for five years for armed robbery, used footage of his punching a young woman in the face during a Berkeley protest as a recruiting video for his white-nationalist organization, Identity Evropa. The Proud Boys went as far as to create an entire culture around gang-style rituals, including initiation beatings. On Facebook, various white men were stating their intention of going to Charlottesville for what they understood would be a huge gathering of the tribes, making plans of whom to meet up with and what to bring. Fears initially advised against carrying weapons, but he suggested keeping them close by. ""It all comes down to police,"" he said on Facebook. ""If they leave us to fight for ourselves like in Berkeley, we know to get ready for bricks to start flying."" In private communications on the chat service Discord, posted online by the progressive watchdog Unicorn Riot, organizers of Unite the Right spent weeks discussing tactics. The F.B.I. itself was limited in its surveillance capacity (though many left-wing groups argued that this did not prevent the bureau from monitoring their activities), and in the absence of comprehensive federal scrutiny, right-wing activists trawled through left-wing websites, shared photos of leading anti-fascist and racial-justice activists and infiltrated real-life gatherings. In advance of the event, leaked chats documented potential attendees openly advising their comrades to take note of any threats of violence so they could share them with the police. Erroll Southers later remarked on the sophistication of advising their followers not to bring cellphones, and sharing information among small cells of affinity groups: ""From an intelligence perspective, it was very impressive."" From a law-enforcement perspective, it was chaos. Rarely did a white-supremacist event draw more than 60 people before 2016; 100 was remarkable. But Charlottesville was another galaxy, both in the sheer number of marchers and their diversity. Southers notes, ""You had factions of white nationalists, white supremacists, Klan members, neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates — which was like having ISIS, Al Qaeda, Al Shabab and Boko Haram at the same rally. And they were all rallying together, shoulder to shoulder, while the police watched these people go toe to toe sort of like a modern-day 'Game of Thrones' battle."" ""I put my baton on the ground and hands in the air,"" the protester later said of the moment when Tyler TenBrink pointed his gun directly at him. The man was terrified. TenBrink took aim and fired. One of the other protesters hid in the trees. Several more crouched behind a small wall, screaming. The bullet missed. The men jumped back into Fears's Jeep and, with Colton behind the wheel, sped away toward Interstate 75 — but not before a witness wrote down the license-plate number. Lieutenant Stout learned of the shooting later that night, and while no one was hurt, his heart sank. In all his preparations, Stout hadn't considered that violence might occur outside the secure perimeter they had so carefully set up. That night, the Florida state police caught up with the Jeep on the highway and arrested the Texans. The city officials breathed a sigh of relief and lauded the day as a success. Will Fears spent more than 40 days in the Alachua County Jail on $1 million bail. Depending on whom he is talking with, he and his brother and TenBrink, who both remain in the Alachua County Jail, were the ""celebrities"" of the jail, or maybe just Fears was. He portrayed his stay as fairly cushy, and one in which he was a very big deal, which of course he wasn't to the authorities who picked him up in December, after Texas ordered him extradited back to Houston to face charges in the supposed assault of his girlfriend last October. Along the way back to Texas, Fears tried to make conversation. ""I was on the news, you didn't see that?"" he remarked. When Fears arrived back in Houston, he spent two nights in the Harris County Jail, then appeared before a judge, who promptly released him on $5,000 bail. Fears returned home to Pasadena and resumed the same life he had always led. Apparently unconcerned about exposure, he had posted his cellphone number on social media. Earlier this year, I called him. We met at a Belgian cafe in a rapidly gentrifying part of Houston. When I arrived, Fears was sitting at an outside table, drinking an Arnold Palmer. Fears told me he had spent most of the past year celebrating the alt-right's covert domination of the news cycle. He seemed thrilled that Donald Trump tweeted about a so-called migrant caravan, which, like the supposed ""white genocide"" in South Africa, was mostly fiction. Yet it was effectively promoted by alt-right websites like The Daily Stormer and Breitbart, and now right-wing celebrities like Ann Coulter and Tucker Carlson were talking about it. ""This idea that the alt-right is falling apart and is going to go away, it's not true,"" he says. ""The alt-right formulates all these ideas,"" he went on. ""What Tucker Carlson talks about, we talked about a year ago."" It was a few days after the massacre of 17 people in Parkland, Fla., and Fears had been considering the spate of school shootings in America. He repeated the rumor, widespread on 4chan and Gab, that the shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was Jewish, and so were many of his victims. It's unclear if this is true. But if it were, it would make no sense to Fears, who, if he believes in anything, believes in the essentially tribal nature of all human beings. Jews, he said, ""have a biological need to look out for their own."" He had spoken a bit about what he called the J.Q., or Jewish Question, as successive generations of anti-Semites have referred to the debate over how Western nations should handle the presence of Jews in their societies. ""I don't hate them for it, but I realize that their interests aren't the same as mine."" Fears's views aren't unique — roughly 22 million Americans call it ""acceptable"" to hold neo-Nazi or white-supremacist views, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll taken in the wake of Charlottesville in August 2017. Roughly the same number of people, about 10 percent of Americans, said they supported the ""alt-right""; about half of those polled said they were against it. Driving around Fears's neighborhood one day, I saw Confederate flags, and American flags, and sometimes a Blue Lives Matter flag, and the black-and-white ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag waving from shiny new trucks. I also saw row after row of McMansions, many of them with swimming pools. There were new S.U.V.s parked in the driveways, and boats: signs of money made and money spent. One former high school classmate of Fears's described the culture as ""wannabe redneck."" Fears says that unlike him, the bulk of the alt-right prefers to stay in the shadows. ""I see a lot of people and talk to a lot of people that people would pay a lot of money to find out who they are,"" he says. Some of them, he suggests, take part in his weekly Thursday-morning ""fight club,"" practicing mixed martial arts. Some have white-collar jobs or are veterans, groups that make up a large part of the movement. Fears was wearing a baseball cap adorned with a red, white and blue patch known as the ""whomster"" flag. It's ""kind of a racist joke,"" he said, albeit one that most people won't get, as they probably have no clue what ""whomster"" means (it's a common meme that refers to the supposed, if baseless, fact that African-Americans say ""whomst"" a lot). The flag featured the Texas lone star against a backdrop of 14 red and white stripes, an allusion to a signature white supremacist slogan addressing their goal of preserving the white race. The star is centered on a large blue sonnerad, or black sun, an ancient symbol favored by white supremacists, who see it as less obvious than, say, a swastika. In recent years, even longtime neo-Nazi groups like the National Socialist Movement have rebranded by dropping the swastika for less ""triggering"" symbols like sonnerads or runes. The meaning is the same. Fears has said that he was upset that his little brother, who in September pleaded guilty to accessory to attempted murder, got in so much trouble. ""He's not really a white nationalist that much,"" he said during an interview with a right-wing podcast. ""He's really only involved in anything as a result of being my little brother."" It was a bit like the little brother-big brother Boston bombing duo, Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whom Fears identifies with. He agreed to meet with me, he said, because I had written about them. ""I think it's easy for our generation, or the youth, the way society is now, to feel victimized. It's like with your back against the wall, you know what I mean?"" In the Tsarnaevs' case, this led to terrorism, and for Dzhokhar, the surviving brother, it led to a stretch on death row. Fears, drinking his iced tea-lemonade concoction, considered this. ""Maybe he saw a lot of things in the world that bothered him and just didn't know how to deal with it,"" he said. ""I can sort of relate to that."" Fears munched on some bread. ""You're Jewish, right?"" he said pleasantly. In fact, I am. And while I happened to be sitting across the table from an admitted fascist who admires Adolf Hitler and has advocated (he says trollishly) ""white Shariah,"" I didn't feel threatened by Will Fears. Like so many of the movement's vague anymen, he presented himself as polite, articulate and interested in cultural politics, and though his views are abhorrent, he stated them all so laconically you might forget that he actually believes in the concept of a white ethnostate. And that's the point: The genius of the new far right, if we could call it ""genius,"" has been their steadfast determination to blend into the larger fabric of society to such an extent that perhaps the only way you might see them as a problem is if you actually want to see them at all. The purpose of the F.B.I.'s Joint Terrorism Task Force is to investigate terrorism and share information from those investigations so that the law-enforcement community is able to identify the most dangerous individuals. State and local law-enforcement ""fusion centers"" were set up with this same goal in mind. There are perhaps half a dozen information-sharing and threat-assessment networks available to law enforcement. In an alternate universe, these networks would function efficiently. In reality, German says, ""far-right violence remains a blind spot. It just isn't properly tracked or understood."" On Aug. 31 this year, his 25th anniversary on the force, Dan Stout retired from the Gainesville Police Department, in part because of the stress and fatigue he endured from the Spencer incident. ""The level of resources and financial impact these types of events are now costing communities to prepare for and manage, it's just unsustainable,"" he says. ""How much of our city do we literally turn into a quasi-police state to manage this?"" Stout's study of the alt-right and left-wing movements made him an ""expert,"" at least in the eyes of federal and state law enforcement, who, he says, began to invite him to visit their jurisdictions to share what he had learned. ""They were soaking it up like a sponge,"" he says. And yet, in reality he feels that they had collectively dodged a bullet — ""no pun intended,"" he says. ""Just another inch to the right or the left and we'd have had a very bad situation."" In May, I called up the Harris County district attorney's office to ask why someone who had been in jail in Florida on $1 million bond had, upon extradition, been released on $5,000 bond. Joshua Phanco, a prosecutor who at the time was in charge of Fears's case, was alarmed by the call. He vaguely recalled that Fears had been in prison in Florida, but he wasn't aware that Fears had been charged with attempted murder, or that he had anything to do with white supremacy. ""This is the first I'm hearing this,"" he told me. (Fears's charge in Florida has since been dropped.) Phanco, who has since moved on to the district attorney's major-crimes division, spoke with me for two hours. He diagramed the byzantine system that is the Harris County criminal-justice system, one of the nation's largest, and a study in dysfunction. There is no central database, no way to share information among all the tiny police departments that feed into the clerk's office, which then divvies up crimes among 22 criminal courts, now scattered across the entire county. Basically, he said, unless someone tells him about a guy he's prosecuting, he has no clue. ""I mean, how come I didn't know what happened in Florida?"" he said. ""Is it my fault? Is it Florida's fault? How come there wasn't an officer in Houston watching this? How come he was on nobody's radar?"" Houston has an aggressive gang task force whose investigators have deep knowledge of everyone from the street-level drug dealers to the cartel bosses. ""If a fairly high-up guy from MS-13 sneezes, I get a call at 10 p.m.,"" he said. If Fears were on someone's radar, Phanco doubted he would ever get off it. ""But who's responsible for keeping track of these alt-right guys in Houston? Nobody. For me the question is, well, how come? If you want to look at these guys as terrorists — which I think it is when they're firing guns out of cars at protesters,"" he noted, ""then the question remains: Who or what will prevent him from committing more crimes? And, from my chair, nobody,"" Phanco said. ""Nobody's watching it, nobody's tracking it. And that's what's got me scared."""
News,2018-11-03,New York Times journalists are reporting from around the country this weekend as candidates make their final pitches to the voters who will help reshape the United States for the next two years.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/us/politics/midterm-elections.html,2810," New York Times journalists are reporting from around the country this weekend as candidates make their final pitches to the voters who will help reshape the United States for the next two years. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Even the little dogs seemed to be swaying, bobbing their heads in a seaside breeze. Beach balls floated above the sun hats and cold drinks and men in sandals and avian-casual button-downs. The state party chairwoman wore a parrot on her head. ""It's tropical,"" said Rand Hoch, 63, explaining the appeal. It's Jimmy Buffett: Florida campaign closer. Days before the election, Mr. Buffett, the state's quintessential beach strummer, had come to rally a lawn full of Democrats here with a message of peace, love and shakers of salt. ""Salt! Salt! Salt!"" the people chanted through the amphitheater, for the chorus of ""Margaritaville."" The politicians were also there: Andrew Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor running for governor, and Senator Bill Nelson. So was Norman Lear, the 96-year-old progressive activist and television producer whose group, People for the American Way, counts Mr. Gillum among its alumni. ""This man is the epitome of the American way,"" Mr. Gillum said, embracing Mr. Lear on stage. Mr. Lear took the microphone for a moment. ""My God,"" he said, feigning shock as he sized up Mr. Gillum, ""he's black."" The joke killed. And then the crowd settled in for a proper concert. Younger guests sang along. Older ones nodded knowingly. A couple sat on the grass munching on a bruschetta plate they'd brought for the occasion. Mr. Lear stayed on stage to watch well after the candidates left. Near the back, a woman tried to focus her daughter's attention. ""Your mom,"" she conceded, ""takes you to the silliest things."" — Matt Flegenheimer HOUSTON — There's a new type of voter causing varying degrees of panic and joy in Texas: Beto-Abbott voters. Some Republican voters — no one knows how many — are supporting a Republican for governor and an underdog Democrat for U.S. Senate. It's an unusual phenomenon that has a lot to do with Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican incumbent facing Representative Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso Democrat. Mr. Cruz's far-right attack-dog persona, failed bid for president and his embrace of President Trump, a former rival who has insulted him and his family, has made the senator unappealing to a subset of moderate Republicans. Gov. Greg Abbott, meanwhile, remains one of the most popular Republicans in the state. Mr. Cruz and his supporters have been confident he will win re-election and dismiss Beto-Abbott voters as fictional creatures. ""I think that's a purple flying unicorn,"" Mr. Cruz said in early October. ""A media creation."" We'd like to introduce Mr. Cruz to a bona fide purple flying unicorn: Charles N. Starnes, an economics professor at Wayland Baptist University in the West Texas city of Plainview. Professor Starnes, 70, has been a Republican since the 1960s and voted for Nixon, Reagan and Romney, among others. He already cast his ballot for Mr. Abbott and Mr. O'Rourke during the early voting period that ended Friday. One moment was instrumental for Professor Starnes. He met Mr. O'Rourke months ago, when the congressman held a town hall in the nearby town of Floydada. In red West Texas, Democratic politicians don't hold many town halls. ""He responded well to the questions,"" he said. ""They were all balanced responses and thoughtful responses rather than political dogma."" Professor Starnes hasn't been bashful about his vote. He's got a Beto sign in his front yard. — Manny Fernandez and Mitchell Ferman WHITESTOWN, Ind. — Mike Braun stood in a parking lot beneath a crisp blue sky Saturday afternoon, greeting Hoosiers as they arrived to vote early. It was stop 23 of 28 in the Republican Party's statewide get-out-the-vote bus tour, and the Republican candidate hoping to oust Senator Joe Donnelly was reminding the several dozen people gathered of the left's ""ugly"" actions during the Kavanaugh hearings. ""I'm running on family values,"" Mr. Braun said, adding that he would ""put emphasis on your local system,"" instead of ""the broken system way out east."" With three days left, social conservative leaders are feeling cautiously optimistic not just about the tight Senate races in Indiana, but also in places like North Dakota, Florida and Missouri. Behind the scenes, some even are saying they feel increasingly confident that Republicans may hold the House, even if their majority shrinks, because they see possible wins in tight races in Virginia, Florida and California about which the Democrats have been hopeful. ""We've got a narrow window,"" Mr. Braun said in a brief interview. ""We have the next two years, and four years after that. We've got to show how our principles work for Middle America."" Austin Lehman, 36, who had just voted, said he felt Mr. Braun would help his own business, in health insurance for churches and nonprofits. ""I love the idea of someone coming out of a business background helping us innovate,"" he said, with his daughter on his shoulders, and his baby in his arms. — Elizabeth Dias ATLANTA — Hours before Stacey Abrams, the Democrat who is vying to become the first black woman elected governor anywhere in the United States, took the stage with former President Barack Obama on Friday night, phones began to ring in Georgia. If people answered, they heard a minute-long stream of racist vitriol, including that Oprah Winfrey, who campaigned with Ms. Abrams on Thursday, was ""the magical Negro"" trying to elevate her ""fellow Negress."" The call said it was the work of a white supremacist website that also claimed responsibility for an incendiary call about Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida. The calls are among the most strident examples of how issues of race have coursed through two of the most high-profile contests this election season. ""I think desperation is one of the hallmarks of some campaigns, and while I'm not saying this has anything to do with my opponent, I think that there's an atmosphere that has been created that signals that that type of attack is allowed,"" Ms. Abrams said. ""I don't think it is, but my response is to do what I've always done."" Brian Kemp, the Republican who is running against Ms. Abrams, denounced the call as ""absolutely disgusting."" The call targeting Ms. Abrams followed a series of messages intended to malign Mr. Gillum, including one last week in which a man impersonated Mr. Gillum in a minstrel accent, with monkey sounds in the background. The campaign of Ron DeSantis, Mr. Gillum's Republican rival, has also disavowed the calls and said it had no connection to them. — Alan Blinder and Patricia Mazzei PHOENIX — The candidates in the Arizona senate race are leaving it all on the field in the final days of their neck-and-neck race. Representatives Martha McSally, the Republican Senate nominee, and Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat in the race, made appearances at the Arizona State University's homecoming game against Utah on Saturday. Ms. McSally sang the national anthem, a duty she's assumed at previous sporting events in the state. Ms Sinema conducted the pregame coin toss. She called tails, winning the toss for Arizona, and posed for pictures with the school's mascot. There were no plans for a debate at halftime. Democrats have tightened the Senate race in the final days, leaving the two women locked in a close race in the run-up to Election Day. Early voting ended on Friday. — Lisa Lerer LAS VEGAS — Nevada saw a surge of star power the final weekend before Election Day as celebrities and political personalities took to the stump here. The late-night host Jimmy Kimmel used his comedy chops to roast Republican Senator Dean Heller while making a case that Representative Jacky Rosen, the Democratic challenger, would take on President Trump if elected. (Read more about Ms. Rosen here.) ""Why should you vote? Well, I'll tell you why. Because the last time a lot of people didn't vote, Donald Trump became the president of the United States. Sorry if you're hearing this for the first time,"" said Mr. Kimmel, whose hometown is Las Vegas. ""Voting is not enough anymore. You also have to get your stupid friends to vote too; that is the key to this."" At a Heller campaign field office in Reno on Thursday, Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, praised the senator for his help passing the Republican tax reform bill this year. ""In politics, I've learned there are talkers and there are doers,"" Ms. Trump told those who gathered, according to The Associated Press. He is definitely a doer."" Donald Trump Jr. also made appearances across the state on Friday, attending a get-out-the-vote event in Reno and delivering remarks at political rally in Las Vegas alongside the Republican congressional candidate Danny Tarkanian. — Jose A. Del Real EAST POINT, Ga. — Andrew Wilson was leaning back in a leather chair at his barbership in Atlanta when the star of one of his favorite TV shows swept in, urging everyone to get out and vote. ""The dude looks like Hollywood,"" Mr. Wilson said, looking at Omar J. Dorsey, who plays a lead in ""Queen Sugar,"" a show created by Ava DuVernay that follows families running a sugarcane farm in the South. He and Mr. Dorsey exchanged bear hugs and selfies, and Mr. Wilson told him not to worry — he had already cast his vote early for Stacey Abrams, after waiting in line more than an hour and half. ""I feel good about it, but we got to knock it out of the park,"" Mr. Wilson said. The ""Queen Sugar"" actors were deployed by Care in Action, which has fielded hundreds of canvassers, many of them child care workers, home health aides or housecleaners, to reach voters of color. They gathered Saturday morning at a roller-skating rink and spent all day knocking on doors as well as dropping in on barbershops and beauty salons. Next stop, a few doors down, was the House of HHC Beauty Lounge. Latitia Lamkin-Brooks, getting her hair done, was giddy at the sight of Mr. Dorsey's co-star, Dawn-Lyen Gardner. Ms. Lamkin-Brooks tried to coax details about next season's plot, but gave her word: she'd show up on Tuesday. — Susan Chira BELGRADE, Mont. — Greetings from Montana, where the Bridger Mountains serve as what might be the most picturesque backdrop of a ""Make America Great Again"" rally to date. The president spent an hour here on Saturday afternoon delivering his closing midterm argument to residents of Big Sky Country. While President Trump stuck to his usual themes — castigating immigration policies, Democrats and Democratic immigration policies — he was less fired up than he was at his appearance in Missoula just over two weeks ago, when he praised the Republican Congressman Greg Gianforte for body-slamming a reporter. (Read a fact-check of Mr. Trump's speech in Montana.) Still, this time, his visit here was personal: The president reserved several minutes of special attention in his efforts to put a pin in the campaign of Jon Tester, the Democratic incumbent struggling to fend off a challenge from Matt Rosendale, whom Mr. Trump was here to support. He zeroed in on Mr. Tester's lack of support for Admiral Ronny Jackson, the president's initial pick to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, whom Mr. Trump said the senator ""tried to destroy."" ""I've never forgotten it,"" Mr. Trump said, ""and it's honestly one of the reasons I'm here so much."" — Katie Rogers FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA — The shoving began shortly after ""We Are the World."" It was an outdoor rally earlier this week for Andrew Gillum, the Democrat who, if he defeats Ron DeSantis on Tuesday, would be the state's first black governor. And — initially, at least — kumbaya spirits were high. People swayed to Michael Jackson and company. Signs bopped in the open-air parking lot: ""Caribbean Americans for Gillum"" and ""Bring It Home"" — the candidate's slogan. Then a man with an National Rifle Association poster moved in, standing sentinel in the crowd. Mr. Gillum's fans surrounded the man, attempting to block his message from view. A small scuffle broke out. Officers swarmed. Fingers pointed. In front of them, a roster of speakers on stage spoke of ""civility"" in politics. Behind them, another heckler with a bullhorn — and ties to the conspiracy-mongering site Infowars — tried to drown them out. ""Bring it home,"" Mr. Gillum shouted, leading a chant. ""With violence,"" the man cried. ""Bring it home."" ""With violence."" Florida in election season. Never dull. Days before another characteristically significant election here — with tight races for governor, Senate and several contested House seats — the state has resumed its status as the consummate, unruly purple corner of the electoral map. • Read more about Ron DeSantis | • Read more about Andrew Gillum Canvassers are canvassing. Rally-goers are rally-going. Emissaries are descending. The president wants in. ""This is my state also,"" President Trump reminded a Republican crowd outside Fort Myers at a recent rally, alluding to his second home at Mar-a-Lago. The former president wants in. ""The character of our country is on the ballot,"" Barack Obama said in Miami on Friday, stumping for Mr. Gillum and Senator Bill Nelson, who is running for re-election. Democrats have said they find the recent tumult galvanizing — days after the arrest of a Florida man accused of sending mail bombs to Mr. Trump's opponents — sharpening their resolve to elect the state's first black governor. ""It's time,"" said Delores Thompson, 65. It's time, at least, to find out. — Matt Flegenheimer Wonder why you're seeing so many campaign ads on TV? Follow the money. The 2018 midterms are being called the $5 billion election. Not only are this year's House and Senate elections expected to set a spending record, they're also expected to surpass previous records by nearly $1 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The money is coming from both ends of the financial spectrum. About 100 extremely wealthy donors (think former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg) are spending $1 million or more — and, in at least one case, more than $100 million — to push their preferred candidates. Then, there are more than six million regular people who are giving tiny amounts — $5 here, $10 there — or an average of about $40 each. Michael Malbin, executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute in Washington, said the big story is how small donors are sending money across state lines. ""If you're in the middle of safe district but you care about control of Congress, it's relatively easy now,"" he said. The top beneficiary appears to be Beto O'Rourke, the Texas Democrat who is hoping to unseat Senator Ted Cruz. Mr. O'Rourke's campaign has raised more than $69 million. The average donation in the last quarter was less than $50. That Senate race alone is expected to cost more than $100 million, also a record. — Stephanie Saul and Rachel Shorey HUDSON, Wis. — Vice President Mike Pence was running about an hour late for his rally with Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, one of the country's most endangered Republicans. And that delay on Saturday afternoon gave Jacquie Niccum, who was waiting patiently in her red ""Make America Great Again"" cap, a lot of time to ponder what Tuesday's midterm elections meant to her. Not that she needed it. ""Right now, it's very important to me that we get a handle on this immigration,"" said Ms. Niccum. Like many people interviewed across the Midwest over the last two weeks — from Iowa to Missouri to Minnesota and here in Wisconsin — many Republican-leaning voters took mere seconds to before mentioning immigration as a top-of-mind concern. The reasons they cite for why they see it as such a threat have several common threads. Even though the southern border — and the caravan of Latin American migrants that so many of them cite — is distant in a physical sense, it is very close in their minds. Immigration troubles them because, they say, it adds too much debt. It is a security issue because they say the government can't possibly know everything about everyone who comes in. And many of them, as Ms. Niccum put it, ""don't want the United States to be changing, transformed."" She added, ""We need to keep our values, our principles that make this country great."" — Jeremy Peters"
News,2018-11-03,"LOS LUNAS, N.M. — The tumultuous 2018 midterm campaign, shaped by conflicts over race and identity and punctuated by tragedy, barreled through its final weekend as voters prepared to deliver a verdict on the first half of President Trump’s term, with Republicans bracing for losses in the House and state capitals but hopeful they would prevail in Senate races in areas where Mr. Trump is popular.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/us/politics/elections-trump-congress.html,2036," LOS LUNAS, N.M. — The tumultuous 2018 midterm campaign, shaped by conflicts over race and identity and punctuated by tragedy, barreled through its final weekend as voters prepared to deliver a verdict on the first half of President Trump's term, with Republicans bracing for losses in the House and state capitals but hopeful they would prevail in Senate races in areas where Mr. Trump is popular. The president was set to storm across two states Saturday, two Sunday and three Monday in an effort to pick off Senate seats in Indiana, Florida and a handful of other battlegrounds where Republicans hope to add to their one-seat majority in the chamber. Democrats and liberal activists, galvanized by opposition to Mr. Trump, gathered Saturday to knock on doors and make turnout calls from Pennsylvania to Illinois to Washington to try to erase the G.O.P.'s 23-seat House majority. The run-up to the election, widely seen as a referendum on Mr. Trump's divisive persona and hard-line policy agenda, has revealed deep strains in the president's political coalition and left him confined to campaign in a narrow band of conservative communities. Republicans' intermittent focus on favorable economic news, such as the Friday report showing strong job growth, has been overwhelmed by Mr. Trump's message of racially incendiary nationalism. While Mr. Trump retains a strong grip on many red states and working-class white voters, his jeremiads against immigrants and penchant for ridicule have proved destabilizing, with the party losing more affluent whites and moderates in metropolitan areas key to control of the House. Republicans have grown increasingly pessimistic in recent days about holding the House, as polls show a number of incumbents lagging well below 50 percent and some facing unexpectedly close races in conservative-leaning districts. In several diverse Sun Belt states where Republicans had shown resilience, such as Texas, Florida and Arizona, their candidates have seen their numbers dip in polling as Mr. Trump has given up the unifying role that American presidents have traditionally tried to play. Democrats are also in contention to retain or capture governorships in rust belt states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that were pivotal to Mr. Trump's victory and fertile ground for Republicans for much of the last decade. Despite these worrisome signs, some Republican leaders saw reason for measured optimism. While Mr. Trump said Friday that Republicans losing the House ""could happen,"" Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, who leads the G.O.P. House campaign committee, has continued to predict that his party will narrowly hold its majority. Republican strategists have argued that about two dozen races are within the margin of error in polling; should right-of-center voters swing back to them on Election Day, they say, Democrats could fall short of winning enough seats to take control of the House. Republican officials were more confident about their prospects in the Senate, where they had an opportunity to enlarge their majority in an otherwise difficult year. Nearly all of the most important Senate races are being fought on solidly conservative terrain, including North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana, where Democratic incumbents are in close contests for re-election. Mr. Trump won all three states by landslide margins in 2016. There was an unmistakable dissonance between the relative health of the economy and the dark mood of a country as voters prepared to go to the polls just days after a wave of attempted mail bombings and a massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead. ""The nation is in political turmoil,"" said Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican facing a difficult re-election in part because of Mr. Trump's unpopularity. ""The economy is roaring but the mood is so sour. It's a very sad time in this country."" The mood that has imperiled lawmakers like Mr. Curbelo has buoyed Democrats across the country. A class of first-time candidates has been lifted by an enormous surge of activism and political energy on the left, as a loose array of constituencies offended by Mr. Trump — including women, young people and voters of color — has mobilized with a force unseen in recent midterm elections. Early voting across the country reflected the intensity of the election: More than 28 million people had already cast ballots by the end of Friday, about 10 million more than at a comparable point in the 2014 midterm elections, according to the Democratic data firm Catalist. These voters have helped nominate a record number of female candidates for Congress and delivered Democrats a wide and unaccustomed financial advantage toward the end of the campaign. The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate. If Mr. Trump has animated a powerful national campaign against him, Democratic candidates have largely avoided engaging the president personally in the closing days of the election, instead hewing close to a few favored issues like health care. At a Saturday morning rally, Representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, the head of the Democrats' campaign committee in the House, drummed home the party's ethos of ignoring Mr. Trump while riding the backlash against him. ""We don't really have to even talk about this president — he's going to do all the talking about himself, for himself,"" Mr. Luján said, addressing volunteers in Los Lunas, where Democrats are making a push to pick up an open House seat. ""I want you to concentrate on families here in New Mexico."" But Senator Martin Henrich, appearing beside Mr. Luján and Xochitl Torres Small, a water-use lawyer who is the Democratic nominee for Congress, cast the election in dire terms familiar to anxious Democrats across the country. ""This is a battle for who we are as a nation,"" said Mr. Heinrich, who is expected to win re-election easily on Tuesday. That mind-set on the left has given Democrats an upper hand in campaign fund-raising. Political spending in the election is expected to exceed $5 billion, making it the most costly midterm contest in history, according to a report by the Center for Responsive Politics. The report found that Democratic candidates for the House had raised more money than their Republican competitors, by a margin of more than $300 million. But many Senate Democrats have also decisively outraised their contenders, a sobering reminder to Republican officials about the rise of small-dollar and billionaire contributors on the left. ""If alarm bells aren't ringing across the Republican landscape as a result of the dollars Democrats have raised and the mechanism they raised them with, then we don't deserve the majority,"" said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, who oversees the Senate Republican campaign arm. Mr. Gardner warned that the Democrats' newfound fund-raising prowess could buffet his party even more in 2020, when a less-inviting list of seats is up for election — including his own. ""We may be able to survive with this map in 2018, but we cannot survive that map in 2020,"" he said. It is the House, though, where Republicans face greater peril. Most critical to determining control of the chamber are likely to be prosperous, culturally dynamic suburbs — around cities like New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles — where Republicans are defending several dozen districts packed with voters in open revolt against Mr. Trump. Democrats have won over many swing voters in these areas with a message focused on Republican health care and tax policies that are even less popular than the president himself. ""I don't think you can find a race in the country where health care hasn't been a dominant issue,"" the Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson said. The fate of Republican lawmakers in the East Coast suburbs could offer an early harbinger on election night of whether the party can maintain even a tenuous grip on the House. Many of those communities could also tip powerful governorships into Democratic hands for the first time in a decade. Former Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, the last Democrat to lead that state, said the election had effectively become a referendum on Mr. Trump, leaving Democrats ""confident about the House and a little concerned about the Senate."" ""He's on the ballot, regardless of whether his name is there or not,"" Mr. Strickland said of the president. Mr. Trump added that the shift in the political climate between 2016 and 2018 was like ""the difference between heaven and hell."" Mr. Trump has appeared to turn his attention in the last few days away from the effort to keep control of the House, and toward shoring up Republicans in coveted Senate races. He has focused predominantly on electrifying the right rather than soothing some of the swing voters who backed him over Hillary Clinton two years ago. In the final weeks of campaigning, Mr. Trump has delivered slashing attacks on immigration, railing against birthright citizenship, linking immigration without evidence to violent crime and amplifying debunked conspiracy theories about a migrant caravan in Latin America. In a possible portent of how he might react to electoral defeat, Mr. Trump lashed out at House Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Twitter after Mr. Ryan criticized his dubious proposal to void the constitutional guarantee of citizenship to anyone born on American soil. Mr. Trump's approach may resonate in several of the states with the closest Senate races, though it has the potential to backfire in several diverse states where Republican-held seats are at risk, including Nevada, Arizona and Texas. ""It turns off independent voters,"" said Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat and head of the Democratic Senate campaign arm, arguing that such states offered his party ""a narrow path"" to a majority. Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster, said the Democratic message, focused on health care, was ""more relevant"" to most voters than what Mr. Trump was offering them in his final argument. Likening the election to a tug of war, Ms. Matthews said the president was trying to energize his predominantly white and male base even as moderate women recoil from him. ""On one end, you've got white college-educated women pulling hard, pulling back from what we're seeing,"" Ms. Matthews said. ""On the other side of the rope, you've got non-college-educated men pulling hard in the other direction."" Even before his lunge toward culture-war rhetoric, Mr. Trump and his party appeared to be receiving scant political advantage from the state of the economy, which has grown steadily during his presidency and pushed the unemployment rate below 4 percent. A dip in the stock market over the final weeks of the campaign appeared to frustrate Mr. Trump, who suggested on Twitter — without evidence — that it reflected investors' concerns about a Democratic takeover. At no point this fall has a majority of voters approved of Mr. Trump, and while some surveys have shown improvement in his standing recently, the Gallup poll found at the end of October that just 2 in 5 Americans rated his performance favorably. If many of the most closely watched elections are at the federal level, governors' races around the country may be the most consequential elections, long term, for both parties. Democrats are hoping to elect a history-making set of candidates, including Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida, who would be the first African-Americans to lead their states. And Republicans are struggling to defend their dominance across Midwestern state governments, from Michigan and Ohio to Wisconsin and Iowa. Should Democrats capture several of those governorships, it could help them redraw congressional district lines to their advantage after 2020. And Republican losses at the state level could complicate Mr. Trump's path to re-election, strengthening the opposition party in crucial battlegrounds where he failed to consolidate support after the 2016 election. Hey, I'm Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I'll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.  But it was the bifurcated maps this year between House and Senate that made 2018 so unusual, with Republicans from different regions sounding as if they hailed from two opposing parties when discussing Mr. Trump. ""If we pick up seats, he's going to be the only reason why,"" Mr. Gardner said, crediting Mr. Trump's aggressive campaigning in red-state Senate races. Yet Mr. Curbelo, who like many of the most endangered House Republicans represents a metropolitan area, portrayed the president as a mildly irritating but distant bystander. ""Republicans are running their own races in each of their districts while the president is talking about topics important to him,"" he said with a wry chuckle."

""When Ian and I fell in love, I didn't expect it to happen on any level,"" she said. ""But, I'd just been through a pretty difficult experience where I didn't expect it. We have to accept the bad things, we have to, but also the good things."" Mr. Mitchard, who was teaching sky diving in California at the time, soon drove to Moab and moved into Ms. Davis' home, a 1968 double-wide trailer with about 20 pairs of climbing shoes lined up neatly on the porch. When he arrived, she welcomed him with a homemade apple pie. ""I'm one to deliberate on decisions, especially of that magnitude, but this one just felt like the right decision,"" he said. They have a lot on common. Both approach their dangerous pursuits methodically. Both love coffee and cats. They are frugal; avoid meat, sugar and television; dislike shopping for clothes and do not carry any debt. Her Instagram feed, with nearly 90,000 followers, is filled with photos of their climbing and flying adventures around the world. On it, she recently described the groom this way: ""My partner in everything, soul flyer, fixer of stuff, blow dryer of kittens, maker of music and spreadsheets."" Read more.

""I thought she was just this incredibly dynamic, intelligent woman,"" Mr. Shenai said. ""We clicked immediately, and spoke as if we had known each other all of our lives."" They learned they had grown up about 100 miles away from each other on opposite sides of Lake Ontario, she in Toronto and he in Rochester. They also lived a block apart in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Washington, and had several friends in common. Mr. Shenai told Ms. Morrison he thought her move to Mexico City, ""was courageous, not crazy."" ""Anyone willing to leave behind a cushy life in a developed world and move to a more uncertain place, well, there's a certain level of adventure there, a willingness to roll the dice,"" he said, ""and I found that very attractive about her."" Ms. Morrison, who would start at Goldcorp in March 2017, knew she had found someone special in Mr. Shenai. ""He was a very handsome and extremely positive person,"" she said. ""He was also very easy to talk to, someone I just wanted to be around."" When they returned to the States for a few weeks to enjoy the holidays with their families, he was all she could think about.

News,2018-11-04,"As Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia charmed Goldman Sachs bankers and Silicon Valley executives on an American tour this spring, some of his most trusted lieutenants were taking care of business in Washington.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/world/middleeast/mckinsey-bcg-booz-allen-saudi-khashoggi.html,1829," As Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia charmed Goldman Sachs bankers and Silicon Valley executives on an American tour this spring, some of his most trusted lieutenants were taking care of business in Washington. In a low-key ceremony two blocks from the White House, Saudi officials signed an agreement with Booz Allen Hamilton, the American consulting company, to help train the kingdom's growing ranks of cyberfighters. The agreement would ""open great horizons"" by improving the skills of the kingdom's cybersecurity experts, Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to the crown prince overseeing the deal, said in Saudi Arabia in a statement to the official press. It did not mention his continuing campaign to silence critics both inside the kingdom and online. Mr. Qahtani was fired last month after Saudi officials linked him to the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying he had contributed to an aggressive environment that helped lead to the killing. But while Mr. Khashoggi's death prompted investors from around the globe to distance themselves from the Saudi government, Booz Allen and its competitors McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group have stayed close after playing critical roles in Prince Mohammed's drive to consolidate power. In addition to standard consulting work like doling out economic advice and helping burnish Prince Mohammed's image, they have taken on more unconventional assignments. Booz Allen trains the Saudi Navy as it runs a blockade in the war in Yemen, a disaster that has threatened millions  with starvation. McKinsey produced a report that may have aided Mr. Qahtani's crackdown on dissidents. BCG advises Prince Mohammed's foundation. The work is lucrative — the three firms have earned hundreds of millions of dollars altogether on projects in Saudi Arabia. McKinsey's work in the kingdom grew from two Saudi projects in 2010 to almost 50 the following year and kept accelerating, to almost 600 projects from 2011 to 2016. McKinsey consultants spread across the kingdom in recent years to advise government agencies such as the planning ministry, nicknamed the ""Ministry of McKinsey"" by some Saudis; the royal court; and a coterie of companies in industries such as banking, media, telecommunications, real estate and energy, internal McKinsey documents viewed by The New York Times showed. Last year, McKinsey bought a politically connected Saudi consultancy, adding that firm's 140 employees to more than 300 already in the region. Its report singling out the kingdom's prominent online critics drew widespread condemnation when The Times revealed it last month. The dissidents — including Khalid al-Alkami, a writer critical of Saudi policies, and Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi now living in Canada — were described in detail, alongside photos of them. ""Omar has a multitude of negative tweets on topics such as austerity and the royal decrees,"" the author, who McKinsey says is a researcher based in Saudi Arabia, wrote in bullet points. Mr. Alkami ""wrote multiple negative tweets regarding austerity."" Though McKinsey said the report was prepared for an internal audience, Mr. Alkami was subsequently arrested, and Mr. Abdulaziz said two of his brothers were imprisoned. A third, pseudonymous account was shut down, and it remains unclear what happened to the person behind it. The crackdown was an early sign of the Saudi government's extreme measures to quash criticism, which culminated in Mr. Khashoggi's murder. McKinsey said it was ""horrified"" at the possibility that its information could have been misused. In a note to former employees, McKinsey said the researcher had published the analysis in January 2017 on an internal system and that it was intended only to ""showcase techniques to gauge social media usage and reaction."" Even before Prince Mohammed rose up the royal hierarchy, McKinsey and BCG nurtured ties to him. BCG's top Middle East executive, Joerg Hildebrandt, cultivated a relationship with Prince Mohammed in recent years, according to two consultants who have worked in the region. Mr. Hildebrandt, through a spokesman, declined to comment. After Prince Mohammed was installed as defense minister in 2015, BCG landed a contract to help overhaul the ministry's procurement systems and improve its handling of finances and personnel, two people familiar with the contract said. Press officers for the Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to emails seeking comment. In February 2016, consultants for McKinsey and BCG escorted five emissaries from the Saudi royal court to make the rounds of think tanks in Washington. They informed Gulf experts about Mohammed bin Salman's grand goals to remake Saudi life while the consultants, who outnumbered the Saudis, quietly took notes. BCG has been deeply enmeshed in laying out the economic blueprint of the country, called Vision 2030, which aims to wean Saudi Arabia from its dependency on oil revenues. A McKinsey report in 2015 laid out the broad strokes of that plan. Asked by The Economist in 2016 about a $4 trillion estimate of needed investment to transform the kingdom's economy, the prince immediately recognized the figure. ""This is a report from McKinsey, not from the Saudi government,"" he replied, adding that McKinsey ""participates with us in many studies."" Last month's Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, a conclave championed by Prince Mohammed, underscored Saudi Arabia's importance to the consulting firms. While executives, companies and journalists pulled out amid the global furor over Mr. Khashoggi's murder, they stayed on. McKinsey led panels on money and energy, the event program showed. Boston Consulting Group focused on unspecified ""intelligence."" In a statement, BCG said it focused in Saudi Arabia on work that could ""positively contribute to economic and societal transformation"" and that the company has turned down work that goes against that principle. The firm declines projects that involve military or intelligence strategy, a spokesman said. For years, Booz Allen has trained the Saudi Navy, part of an American government program to help allied militaries. The company has worked with the navy on operations, intelligence and electronic warfare, as well as logistics and financial management, it said in 2012. The contract ended last year, a spokesman said. Dozens of American military veterans work for Booz Allen in Saudi Arabia. One retired rear admiral with combat experience in the region advises top Saudi officers on military planning. Others have extensive shipboard experience that could be used to train Saudis on how to carry out blockades and how to operate equipment like electronic warfare gear that can detect and interfere with enemy radars and missiles. A spokesman for Booz Allen said the firm's work with the Saudis did not include training on blockades or electronic warfare equipment. The spokesman said such work was out of the parameters of its United States government license covering the company's work with the Saudis. Booz Allen also advises the Saudi Army; it won a contract to help with logistics, including maintaining the Saudis' Abrams tanks. In a statement, Booz Allen said that it had provided no support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, and that the company coordinates with the American government to ensure that its work ""is consistent with U.S. foreign policy and trade regulations."" The firm did not address whether the troops and sailors it trains participate in the Saudi blockade in Yemen. The United States military has provided limited but significant aid to the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, including refueling aircraft, sharing intelligence and sending Army commandos to the Saudi-Yemeni border to locate and destroy caches of ballistic missiles that Iran-backed Houthi rebels have used to attack Saudi cities. Booz Allen did advise the Saudi government on a plan to provide humanitarian aid to Yemen. But the project, the Yemen Comprehensive Humanitarian Operations, is seen by aid groups as an ineffective effort that undercuts the United Nations' own program. ""We have had no control over how the plan or portions of it may have been used,"" the company said. Booz Allen's role was first reported by IRIN, a humanitarian news agency. After signing the agreement in March to help shore up Saudi cybersecurity, Booz Allen began working directly to protect the systems of government ministries, citing ""damaging cyberattacks in companies in the kingdom."" It also ran a so-called hack-a-thon — the kind of event the company has done in the United States to teach people how to penetrate computer systems to discover their vulnerabilities. Booz Allen denied that its work with the Saudis involved hacks ""or the use of cyber for offensive purposes."" But cyberexperts say that the same defensive maneuvers used to discover vulnerabilities or otherwise protect computer networks can easily be redirected to target other governments or dissidents as well. As for McKinsey, its work with Saudi Arabia is controversial even within the firm. Amid the Arab Spring, its consultants in the region argued that the firm should consider curtailing business in Saudi Arabia, said one former McKinsey consultant who worked in the Middle East. But more senior consultants, including partners, said McKinsey was not in the business of passing judgment on its clients' cultures and values. The best way to improve the kingdom, they argued, was to modernize the economy and make government and companies work better. Rather than scaling back in Saudi Arabia, McKinsey doubled down. Many foreign consultants working in Saudi Arabia fail to understand the local culture or how an authoritarian government could exploit their work, said one consultant who has worked with the higher reaches of the Saudi government. He qualified that by saying that his colleagues take care to try not to cause harm. In a statement, a McKinsey spokesman said, ""We are proud of our record in Saudi Arabia,"" citing job creation and improved health outcomes. Consultants who aim to help authoritarian governments from the inside often give in to a desire to preserve their lucrative assignments, said Calvert W. Jones, a professor at the University of Maryland who studies the role of consultants in the Middle East. ""They soft-pedal,"" she said. ""Their fear is if they speak truth to power at this state of their interactions, they will be tossed out."" The surge in business for BCG, McKinsey and Booz Allen also stems from Prince Mohammed's need for expertise as he pushes his proposals to revamp the country. His dependence on consultants is so great that some of the companies have people embedded at the royal court to respond quickly to requests, according to three consultants who have done work for the kingdom. Some reported being asked to turn around proposals in 24 hours, much faster than they often work. And the crown prince will sometimes ask different companies for proposals, then have their consultants pitch to each other as he looks on, the consultants said. ""It's like a beauty pageant,"" said one. Many of the consultants, who spend five days a week in Riyadh before flying elsewhere to see their families on weekends, were annoyed last year when the government kicked them out of their preferred hotel, the Ritz-Carlton, to use it as a temporary lockup for those accused of corruption. But not long after the government released those held, the consultants moved back in."
Obituary (Obit),2018-11-04,"HONG KONG — Raymond Chow, a Hong Kong film producer who thrust Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan into global stardom while helping to transform the action movie genre, died on Friday in Hong Kong. He was 91.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/movies/raymond-chow-dead.html,763," HONG KONG — Raymond Chow, a Hong Kong film producer who thrust Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan into global stardom while helping to transform the action movie genre, died on Friday in Hong Kong. He was 91. His death was confirmed in a statement by Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive. The statement did not list a cause of death. A former journalist, Mr. Chow entered the film industry as a publicist in 1958, when he joined Shaw Brothers, a studio that had a pioneering role in kung fu movies and other popular low-budget films. But he quickly grew frustrated with the quality of the studio's output. ""It was hard to publicize a film that I do not believe in,"" he said in a 2011 interview. ""There are only so many lies I can tell. I can't really exaggerate. Nobody will believe us."" So the studio founder, Run Run Shaw, invited him to contribute his ideas on scripts, and he soon became a producer. Mr. Chow longed for more freedom over his work, and in 1970 he left to co-found his own studio, Golden Harvest. Golden Harvest's initial films did poorly against Shaw Brothers, which dominated the local market. But Mr. Chow then outbid his former employer to sign Bruce Lee, a young actor and martial arts expert who had appeared in the sidekick role of Kato on the American television series ""The Green Hornet."" Mr. Chow had seen Mr. Lee break boards in displays of powerful kicks and punches on Hong Kong television, and learned that Shaw Brothers had been unable to sign him to a film contract. Golden Harvest offered him $15,000 for two films, along with a share of the profits and greater say in the production. Mr. Lee agreed, and Mr. Chow quickly flew his new actor to Thailand, where, in rough rural conditions, he filmed ""The Big Boss"" in 1971. Mr. Lee's intense aura and florid fight scenes helped the film become the most successful one shown in Hong Kong to that point, breaking the box-office total set by ""The Sound of Music."" That success was followed by hits including ""Fist of Fury"" and ""The Way of the Dragon."" ""In our early action films, we used actors who knew little about fighting,"" Mr. Chow told The New York Times in 1973. ""We had to use various camera tricks. But the audience can tell the difference. It knows a real fighter when it sees one. That's why Bruce Lee has been such a hit."" After Mr. Lee's death in 1973, Jackie Chan became a breakout star for Golden Harvest. He first imitated Mr. Lee, then modified his style to develop a more irreverent, comedic style of kung fu film. Mr. Chao also discovered Angela Mao, who is called the first female kung fu star, and produced her first major film, ""Hapkido,"" or ""Lady Kung Fu,"" in 1972. ""I have to thank God and Raymond Chow,"" she told The Times in 2016. Mr. Chow pursued films in Hollywood in the 1980s, and Golden Harvest produced several American box-office hits, including ""The Cannonball Run,"" with an ensemble cast that included Burt Reynolds. Mr. Chow found small roles for Mr. Chan and the Hong Kong comedian Michael Hui in the movie, hoping to develop the market for Chinese actors in the United States. While his works were often critically panned, Mr. Chow had an eye for box-office success. In the 1990s, Golden Harvest produced the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" series, based on earlier comic books and cartoons. The first film took in more than $200 million. Mr. Chow was born in Hong Kong on Oct. 8, 1927. He attended St. John's University in Shanghai before returning to Hong Kong in 1949, when Mao Zedong and the Communist Party took over China. He worked as a journalist for outlets including The Hong Kong Standard and Voice of America. The names of his survivors were not immediately available. His production company had a long run of success, but it stumbled after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, just as mainland China's film industry began to grow. He sold his stake in the company in 2007 to the mainland businessman Wu Kebo, who merged it with his own entertainment group to create Orange Sky Golden Harvest Entertainment. In a 2013 interview with The South China Morning Post, Mr. Chow described a liberated, collaborative style as the underpinning of his work. ""My philosophy is to entertain people, to make people happy,"" he said. ""Filmmaking also suits my way of thinking: I love freedom, and don't like being placed under restrictions."""
News,2018-11-04,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A Shiite cleric who was a central figure in Bahrain’s 2011 Arab Spring protests was sentenced on Sunday, along with two other senior opposition figures, to life in prison, overturning previous acquittals on charges of spying for Qatar.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/world/middleeast/bahrain-sheikh-ali-salman-spying-qatar.html,613," DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A Shiite cleric who was a central figure in Bahrain's 2011 Arab Spring protests was sentenced on Sunday, along with two other senior opposition figures, to life in prison, overturning previous acquittals on charges of spying for Qatar. Amnesty International called the sentence a ""travesty of justice."" The public prosecutor said the court had sentenced the cleric, Sheikh Ali Salman, secretary general of the opposition al-Wefaq group; and Sheikh Hassan Sultan and Ali Alaswad, members of the same group, for transferring confidential information to and receiving financial support from Qatar, according to Reuters. The prosecutor had appealed a court ruling that acquitted the three last June in a rare victory for opposition figures who say they have been targeted for their political views. Mr. Salman is already serving a four-year prison sentence on charges of inciting hatred, after he was arrested in 2015. Mr. Sultan and Mr. Alaswad were tried in absentia. ""This verdict is a travesty of justice that demonstrates the Bahraini authorities' relentless and unlawful efforts to silence any form of dissent,"" Amnesty International said in a statement. ""Sheikh Ali Salman is a prisoner of conscience who is being held solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression."" The verdict was issued just weeks before parliamentary elections are set to take place without al-Wefaq, which was the tiny Gulf nation's largest Shiite opposition bloc. Courts in Bahrain, where the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet is based, dissolved al-Wefaq and National Democratic Action Society (Waad) in 2016 as part of a crackdown on dissent in the kingdom, which has a Shiite majority but is ruled by a Sunni monarchy. The groups were accused of helping to foster violence and terrorism. Al-Wefaq, which has strong links to the country's Shiite Muslim majority, and Waad, which is seen as a secular movement, have both campaigned for social and political reforms in the country, The Associated Press said. Bahrain has barred members of dissolved opposition groups from running in the parliamentary elections. The three faced charges of disclosing sensitive information to Qatar that could harm Bahrain's security in exchange for financial compensation. The state-run news agency said prosecutors had presented recorded phone conversations as evidence. Last year, Bahrain state television broadcast the recorded calls between Mr. Salman and Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani, then Qatar's prime minister, during the 2011 protests. Mr. Alaswad, who has lived in London since 2011, has told Reuters that the public prosecutor used secret witnesses and a video from a Bahraini television channel that experts described as edited and incomplete. Along with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, Bahrain imposed a boycott on Qatar last year, accusing it of supporting terrorism and cozying up to Iran. Qatar denies the charges, saying they are an attempt to undermine its sovereignty. Since the Bahrain authorities crushed street protests in 2011, demonstrators have clashed frequently with security forces, who have been targeted by bomb attacks. Manama says Qatar supports the unrest, accusations denied by Doha. Mr. Salman, who is in his early 50s, has long been targeted by Bahrain's government. In 1994, he was arrested, allegedly tortured and detained for months without trial before being deported and forced to live in exile for more than 15 years, according to the United Nations. He is currently serving out a four-year sentence on charges he insulted the Interior Ministry, which oversees the police; incited others to break the law; and incited hatred against naturalized Sunni citizens, many of whom serve in Bahrain's security forces. Brian Dooley, a senior adviser at Human Rights First, said Sunday's ruling ""confirms there is now no tolerance for any dissent in Bahrain,"" according to The A.P."
News,2018-11-04,"This spring, a British lord with deep ties to the governing Conservative Party and a reputation as a do-gooder environmentalist arrived in Washington on an unlikely mission: to save the business empire of Oleg Deripaska, one of Russia’s most infamous oligarchs.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/world/europe/oleg-deripaska-russia-oligarch-sanctions.html,4281," This spring, a British lord with deep ties to the governing Conservative Party and a reputation as a do-gooder environmentalist arrived in Washington on an unlikely mission: to save the business empire of Oleg Deripaska, one of Russia's most infamous oligarchs. Mr. Deripaska was in deep trouble. In April, the Trump administration had announced sanctions on oligarchs close to President Vladimir V. Putin, and on their companies, as punishment for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and for other hostile acts. A billionaire who controls the world's second-largest aluminum company, Mr. Deripaska faced possible ruin. Portrayed as little more than a thug by his critics and suspected by United States officials of having ties to Russian organized crime, Mr. Deripaska, 50, has spent two decades trying to buy respect in the West. London welcomed him; Washington still mostly has not. Successive administrations have limited his ability to travel to the United States. Even Mr. Putin was unable to resolve the situation when he interceded personally with Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama on Mr. Deripaska's behalf. But with so much on the line this time, Mr. Deripaska's allies are now fighting back aggressively, mobilizing a vast influence machine on both sides of the Atlantic in an all-out effort to undo the sanctions against his companies before they take full effect. The campaign to help Mr. Deripaska is playing out against an especially sensitive political backdrop. Any step by the administration that is seen as favorable to a powerful Russian is sure to draw scrutiny at a time when the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is continuing his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Moreover, Mr. Deripaska has been a subsidiary character in that inquiry, not as a target but because he at one point employed Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, as an adviser. Mr. Manafort was convicted on one set of fraud charges and pleaded guilty to other charges in cases brought by Mr. Mueller, and is now cooperating with the prosecution. But the current lobbying effort on behalf of Mr. Deripaska's companies still appears to have made substantial headway. In recent months, Mr. Deripaska's firms have notched initial victories by winning multiple postponements from the Treasury Department of the sanctions on the oligarch's holding company, EN+, and the giant aluminum company it controls, Rusal. Now, with the administration closing in on its latest self-imposed deadline to make a final decision by Dec. 12, there are signs that Mr. Deripaska's companies could escape the sanctions entirely. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has signaled that he is open to a plan under which Mr. Deripaska would reduce his stake in his companies in return for the sanctions being lifted. But sidestepping the business sanctions is not Mr. Deripaska's only goal. His team is preparing an audacious and previously unreported campaign to remove the personal sanctions on him, too. Removing the personal sanctions would eliminate substantial barriers to his doing business in the United States and around the world, and could be a requirement for him to get his hands on the money — potentially billions of dollars — resulting from any sale of part of his stake in the companies. ""Oleg Deripaska understands better than most Russian oligarchs how money buys influence in Washington,"" said Michael R. Carpenter, a former National Security Council official during the Obama administration who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. ""It seems like he's now using that knowledge to try to save his skin."" The elaborate influence operation highlights one of the fastest-growing elements of the lobbying business: helping deep-pocketed foreign interests massage the sanctions, tariffs and other tools deployed by Mr. Trump against foreign governments, individuals and industries. The British emissary for Mr. Deripaska's companies, Lord Barker of Battle, a protégé of David Cameron, the former prime minister of Britain, was appointed last year as chairman of EN+. Also involved are lobbyists, law firms, public relations experts, a former United States senator and a former Trump campaign official with ties to the Treasury Department and the White House. Even ambassadors to Washington from a number of countries have been approached to write letters opposing the sanctions. The Treasury Department's decision carries significant economic implications, given Rusal's vital place in supplying aluminum around the world. Lord Barker and the team trying to fight off the sanctions say that enacting them against EN+ and Rusal would create turmoil in global metals markets, damage American manufacturers and potentially play into China's hands. Their proposal, the ""Barker Plan,"" would see Mr. Deripaska sell down his ownership stake in EN+, his holding company, to below 50 percent and step away from management of EN+ and Rusal. But this would hinge on being able to trust and verify that a Russian oligarch who has spent decades building up a global empire — amid persistent accusations that he is more a Kremlin loyalist than an independent tycoon — is truly giving up control. Mr. Deripaska's track record on two continents offers a case study in how the world's wealthiest people can mount sophisticated campaigns to fight for their interests at the highest levels, often in ways that are not fully visible and that are reliant on the willingness of insiders to provide access. He has sought to rebrand himself as a progressive and pro-Western business executive and philanthropist. Mr. Manafort is among an army of lobbyists, lawyers and consultants whom Mr. Deripaska has employed around the world to help him build and protect his empire, or to try to persuade the United States to grant him visas on a regular basis. Mr. Deripaska has courted powerful political figures in Britain, played host to lavish parties in Davos, Switzerland, and once hired a former Republican presidential nominee, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, to lobby for him. ""There is already a perception — certainly abroad, but even in Washington — that Washington is a city where you buy influence rather than having to make arguments and do the right thing,"" said Peter Harrell, who worked on sanctions issues in the State Department during the Obama administration. ""That perception would be crystallized by a sanctioned company being able to lobby its way off the list,"" he said. ""If Deripaska faces enormous losses, it would send a message of sanctions success, but if Deripaska is able to get off with a slap on the wrist, that would be a massive blow to the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions."" Mr. Deripaska's troubled reputation derives in large part from what was also his greatest triumph: his victory over rivals and partners during the 1990s, when well-connected Russians were competing to win control of state assets after the collapse of the Soviet Union. That competition, the so-called aluminum wars, was a corpse-filled struggle for control of Siberian smelters and other state-owned Soviet assets that was so violent that even some of Russia's toughest tycoons gave it a wide berth. ""There were so many murders that I refused to go into this business,"" recalled Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a billionaire former oil magnate who now lives in self-exile in London and who during the 1990s forbade his associates from pursuing a smelter deal. ""I told them: 'Don't go out there. I need you to stay alive.'"" Mr. Deripaska, who once studied physics at Moscow State University, became a billionaire. But he was left with a ruthless image, especially as claims later emerged in legal battles in London and the United States that he engaged in theft, intimidation, bribery and even murder, notably of a Russian banker in 1995. (None of the accusations have been substantiated.) One complaint filed in Delaware cast Mr. Deripaska as a member of a criminal gang that seized control of an iron-ore mining complex in the Ural Mountains in the late 1990s. The previous manager claimed that at a meeting attended by Mr. Deripaska, a mafia leader and five armed thugs, he was told to transfer a majority share or ""this is the last time you will leave here alive."" The case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and Mr. Deripaska's lawyers have routinely responded to lawsuits with counterclaims that his accusers were themselves crooks and lacked credibility. (A London arbitration tribunal did order him to pay $95 million in 2017 for knowingly lying to the tribunal while finding he had ""acted oppressively"" to his former partner in a Moscow property venture.) His dominance of the Russian metals markets gave him the resources to look abroad. By 2000, he commenced a decade of overseas expansion, buying a smelter in Montenegro, an aluminum factory in Ireland and bauxite mines in Africa. Then he turned his eyes to London. Mr. Deripaska was now a global figure, and London was becoming the money-soaked fulcrum for a glitzy, international business and the social elite. He bought a six-story mansion on Belgrave Square, as well as a country house in Surrey. He married Polina Yumasheva, a British-educated daughter of the chief of staff of Boris N. Yeltsin, Russia's former president. (The couple has since divorced.) Ensconced in society, Mr. Deripaska befriended Nathaniel Rothschild, a British-born financier whose father is a British peer, and through him met the Conservative Party politician George Osborne, a future chancellor of the Exchequer, as well as Lord Peter Mandelson, a leading figure in the Labour Party. Mr. Deripaska reveled among global movers and shakers, and he remains a regular figure at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He has always argued that these relationships were simply friendships, but soon questions would arise about whether he was really trying to buy influence. The British news media revealed that the oligarch had flown Mr. Rothschild and Lord Mandelson on his private jet in 2005 for a jaunt in Siberia. At the time, Lord Mandelson was the European Union's trade commissioner, and in this role, he oversaw a cut in tariffs on aluminum imports from Russia requested by Poland and other members of the bloc. It was a boon to Rusal. (The European Commission has denied that Mr. Mandelson personally intervened in the matter.) Mr. Rothschild sued a British newspaper for libel for suggesting that the trip was anything more than an act of friendship, but the judge ruled against him. In the summer of 2008, Mr. Deripaska again played host, this time on his yacht, Queen K, off the Greek island of Corfu. Onboard were Mr. Osborne, Lord Mandelson and Andrew Feldman, a Conservative Party fund-raiser. The yacht meeting caused a media and political storm in Britain, after claims in a letter to The Times of London by Mr. Rothschild, who was also in Corfu, that Mr. Osborne had sought a contribution from Mr. Deripaska to the Conservative Party. Mr. Osborne denied requesting what would have been an illegal donation. ""Deripaska does not hang around with people like this for social reasons,"" said Mark Hollingsworth, an author of ""Londongrad,"" a book about Russian oligarchs in the British capital. ""He is not mesmerized by the historical legacy of the British elite. He is not really interested in high society and parties. It is much more hard-nosed commercial calculation: 'Who are the big names, who has the power and who can help me?'"" And London unquestionably had lawyers, bankers, consultants and former politicians willing to earn generous fees by working in the service of Russian oligarchs with unseemly pasts. ""To outsiders, it seems extraordinary that reputable banks and people would ever get involved,"" said Tom Keatinge, a former banker with J. P. Morgan who now directs the Center for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute, a British research organization. ""But when there are big fees on the table, people's point of view is not the same."" Mr. Deripaska also had his eyes on the United States, where he had acquired property and had business links with Alcoa, the world's sixth-largest aluminum producer. But in Washington, the reception was much chillier. The State Department, worried that he had connections to Russian organized crime, has restricted his travel to the United States for years, mostly forcing him to rely on occasional American visas or a Russian diplomatic passport. Despite the barriers, he has managed visits to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Hawaii, people familiar with his travel said. Annoyed, and cognizant of the potential effect on his business, Mr. Deripaska has pursued winning easier and more regular access to the United States with near-obsessive zeal. One moment of success came in 2005, when he was given a multiple-entry American visa, after hiring Mr. Dole, the former presidential nominee who had gone into lobbying. Mr. Dole's firm, Alston & Bird, reported receiving an upfront lobbying fee of $300,000 from Mr. Deripaska, followed by at least $270,000 in additional payments over the next few years, according to congressional lobbying reports. In the end, the victory was short-lived: The visa was revoked not long after being granted at the request of the F.B.I., a person briefed on the process said. Around the time his visa was being revoked, Mr. Deripaska hired Mr. Manafort and signed his firm to a $10 million-a-year contract in 2006 to advise him. One of Mr. Manafort's associates lobbied President George W. Bush's administration to reconsider the visa issue, but the efforts went nowhere, according to David Merkel, who worked on Russia-related issues in Mr. Bush's White House and State Department. ""Deripaska has spent years trying to mainstream himself into the political and financial elite,"" Mr. Merkel said. Mr. Manafort and his business partner at the time, Rick Davis, arranged a meeting in 2006 on the sidelines of the Davos forum between Mr. Deripaska and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who was preparing a campaign for president. There is no evidence anything came of the meeting, though it became a liability for Mr. McCain's campaign. Mr. Deripaska eventually fired Mr. Manafort and his partner. He later sued them after a dispute over a telecommunications deal they had pursued together. In the months before the election of Barack Obama in 2008, Mr. Deripaska turned to a lobbyist with Democratic connections, Adam Waldman, who served in the Justice Department under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Waldman earned $40,000 a month to help the oligarch with visa issues, as well as with business matters like aluminum trade talks and an unsuccessful bid to buy European operations from General Motors. Mr. Waldman helped him arrange various trips, including to attend a Wall Street Journal-sponsored summit meeting of top business executives in Washington. He also later arranged meetings between Mr. Deripaska and George Soros, the wealthy Democratic donor, to discuss anticorruption efforts in the mining industry in Guinea, where Rusal is a major player, according to people familiar with the meetings. Hoping to show that he could be useful to the United States, Mr. Deripaska used his connections and resources at one point in a thwarted effort to help Washington win the release of a hostage in Iran. In the weeks before the 2016 election, Mr. Deripaska rebuffed an approach from the F.B.I., which was seeking his help in the early stages of the inquiry into Russian meddling. ""He didn't need introductions to other captains of industry or philanthropists. They lined up to meet with him,"" Mr. Waldman said. ""Only elements of the U.S. government had a problem with him — that they would insinuate in leaks and blocks, but never state outright."" Mr. Deripaska's long struggle to travel more freely to the United States had cost him time, money and pride. But a far bigger problem throughout was keeping his business empire afloat. Saddled with debt, Mr. Deripaska raised money to stave off creditors in January 2010 by listing Rusal, his aluminum company, on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. He appointed his old friend from London, Mr. Rothschild, to his international advisory board. But that only forestalled the pressure to repay a corporate loan of $942 million from VTB, a Russian bank considered close to Mr. Putin and under sanction by the United States. To do this, Mr. Deripaska decided to put a small portion of his 96 percent stake in EN+, which controlled Rusal, on the market with a listing on the London exchange in November 2017. Yet prospective investors were initially lukewarm. Mr. Deripaska was trailed by accusations of wrecking the environment and taking advantage of his partners. The prospectus listed 37 pages of fine print on ""risk factors."" Once again, Mr. Deripaska turned to the city's influence industry. EN+ hired a well-connected London public relations company, run by Roland Rudd, whose sister, Amber Rudd, was Britain's home secretary at the time. Mr. Deripaska reached out to a consultancy owned by Lord Mandelson. And he hired major international banks to organize the offering. Most important, EN+ found a new chairman, only weeks before the stock offering: Lord Barker, a former energy minister responsible for climate change policy. Unlike Mr. Deripaska, Lord Barker had a largely spotless reputation. His only minor brushes with scandal came in 2006, when he left his wife to live with a male interior decorator, and in 2012, while serving as energy minister, when he made the tabloids for using a microwave at Parliament to warm a cushion for his pet dachshund, Otto. Lord Barker's appointment, the company declared, was proof of its ""commitment to the best standard of corporate governance."" His allies say his efforts since then have been focused on what is best for the company — its employees and all of its shareholders — rather than on Mr. Deripaska's personal benefit. Others saw Lord Barker's appointment as chairman of EN+ as proof of a phenomenon known as ""Lords on Boards,"" a long line of eminent Britons willing to lend their names and connections to Russia's scandal-singed elite. Before entering politics in the early 2000s, Lord Barker had worked in Moscow as the head of investor relations for Sibneft, a Russian oil company connected to two Russian oligarchs, Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, a onetime business partner of Mr. Deripaska's. Lord Barker's job was to persuade often skeptical investors and financial journalists that Sibneft had shaken off its shady past in rigged privatization deals and broken with the habits of its oligarch founders. Now, Lord Barker assumed the chairmanship of EN+ and the London listing was a success. Mr. Deripaska, with his family, took around $1.5 billion from the stock sale and was able to repay VTB. Then in April came the sanctions announcement from Washington, which Mr. Deripaska described in a statement as ""groundless, ridiculous and absurd."" The world's aluminum market shook, as shares of EN+ went into a nosedive on the London exchange, where the company quickly lost more than half of its value. The sanctions, which punish third parties that do business with designated companies and individuals, led to a mass exodus of his advisers. In London, Mr. Rudd's public relations company bailed, as did the consultancy business run by Lord Mandelson. Citigroup and Credit Suisse, which EN+ named in January as ""joint corporate brokers"" and which earlier had worked on the company's public offering along with other banks, swiftly severed relations. In Washington, Mr. Waldman terminated his representation of Mr. Deripaska and Rusal. The prospect that it would soon become illegal under United States law to do business with the world's biggest aluminum producer outside of China made it dangerous to sign long-term contracts with any entity connected to Mr. Deripaska. Manufacturers feared grave disruptions in their supplies. Hanging on as chairman of the board, however, was Lord Barker. Rather than being a figurehead chairman, he was suddenly faced with having to save a company whose structures he had only just become acquainted with. Friends say Lord Barker is not in it for the money but for an opportunity to promote renewable energy, of which Mr. Deripaska has vast amounts thanks to his hydroelectric plants in Siberia and his investments in solar power. ""He would not compromise his beliefs for money,"" said Peter Brown, a British businessman and friend of Lord Barker's who once managed the Beatles. In recent months, Lord Barker has lobbied Ireland's business minister to press the Treasury Department to relent on sanctions. He has also made trips to Moscow and to Cyprus, where he presided over the annual general meeting of EN+. Most important, Lord Barker began hiring lobbyists and lawyers in Washington to promote the Barker Plan. The core of that plan is the still-to-be-proved proposition that Lord Barker and his allies are not merely puppets, and that Mr. Deripaska is really willing to sell down his stake and step away from his empire. The legal and lobbying teams for Mr. Deripaska's companies have proposed various measures to reassure the United States government that he would truly do so — and not immediately benefit from an expected rebound in value that would come from lifting the corporate sanctions. He and several allies have resigned from top positions at EN+ and Rusal. The Barker Plan also calls for the creation of an escrow account into which the proceeds from Mr. Deripaska's stock sales would be deposited. He would be barred from accessing the money until he met certain conditions, including being removed from the personal sanctions list. Lord Barker ""wants to save Deripaska by getting rid of Deripaska,"" said David Ruffley, a former British legislator and an old friend of Lord Barker's. In Washington, Lord Barker turned to Mercury Public Affairs. Only a few weeks after the sanctions were announced, Bryan Lanza, a former Trump campaign and transition aide who is now a Mercury lobbyist, contacted top officials at the Treasury and State Departments and at the White House. At that point, Mercury was in the final stages of signing a $108,500-a-month contract to represent the board of directors of EN+. Mercury registered with the Justice Department as a ""foreign agent"" working on behalf of ""Lord Gregory Barker of Battle,"" not for Mr. Deripaska or his companies, which might have been prohibited under the sanctions. Since then, according to lobbying filings, Mr. Lanza has been busy texting, emailing, calling and sometimes meeting with influential White House appointees, including Justin Clark, the director of the Office of Public Liaison, and Mercedes Schlapp, the director of strategic communications. At the State and Treasury Departments, Mr. Lanza and his associates at Mercury corresponded with or met with officials involved in sanctions policy, such as David Meale, the acting deputy assistant secretary of state overseeing sanctions, and Seth Bridge, a top Treasury sanctions policy adviser. Mr. Lanza shared talking points with some administration officials about how Mr. Trump could claim a victory if the sanctions forced Mr. Deripaska to relinquish control of his companies, but allowed the companies — which are hugely important to the global aluminum market — to stay in business, according to people familiar with the effort. Coincidentally or not, Mr. Mnuchin made statements that sounded similar themes, signaling that the United States might be open to a deal that would spare Mr. Deripaska's companies from the sanctions. Speaking to reporters at the White House in late July, Mr. Mnuchin said the aim of sanctions was to ""change the behavior of the oligarch,"" not to punish his aluminum business. That line of argument has now been seized on by both Lord Barker and Mr. Deripaska as they await announcement of the administration's decision. Lord Barker's office issued a statement saying he was ""increasingly optimistic"" that a deal would be struck. Lord Barker declined repeated requests to be interviewed. On Saturday, an associate of Mr. Deripaska relayed an offer to arrange an interview with the oligarch if The New York Times refrained from publishing this story until after Treasury decides on the sanctions. The Times declined the offer. In a separate statement issued through Rusal's press office, which was similar in wording to Lord Barker's statement, Mr. Deripaska said, ""To protect the dedicated employees of EN+ and Rusal, and to preserve the rights of all global stakeholders of both companies, I have chosen to relinquish any remaining management or control of both EN+ and Rusal."" A Treasury spokesman disputed any suggestion that Mr. Mnuchin's approach to sanctions has been shaped by Mercury's efforts, or that the department has changed its position. If nothing else, the lobbying effort is notable for its scale. Lord Barker's team and Mr. Deripaska's companies have also turned to a trio of high-powered law firms to make their case to Treasury. Latham & Watkins is representing Lord Barker; Dentons is handling negotiations for Rusal; and Steptoe & Johnson is working for EN+, according to people familiar with the effort. Another Mercury lobbyist, the former Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, led an effort to rally foreign ambassadors in Washington against sanctions, working to persuade them that hurting Mr. Deripaska's business will hurt manufacturing in their own countries by disrupting the supply of aluminum. While awaiting the Trump administration's decision, Mr. Deripaska has lowered his public profile since announcing his resignation from the EN+ board in May. His wealth on paper has fallen by $4 billion since April because of the sharp fall in the company's stock price. He and his family now control a 77 percent stake in EN+ and, as yet, have not sold any their shares. No matter what happens, K Street is profiting. In fact, Mr. Deripaska's team has approached still more lawyers and public relations consultants in recent weeks about joining an effort to try to remove the personal sanctions against him, too, describing it as a long-term campaign."
Editorial,2018-11-05,"One happy reality of the 2018 campaign for New Yorkers is that they are guaranteed to make history on Tuesday: They will elect the state’s first black attorney general, either Letitia James, a Democrat, or Keith Wofford, a Republican.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/opinion/letitia-james-new-york-attorney-general.html,967," One happy reality of the 2018 campaign for New Yorkers is that they are guaranteed to make history on Tuesday: They will elect the state's first black attorney general, either Letitia James, a Democrat, or Keith Wofford, a Republican. New York has reason to be proud of this choice. Mr. Wofford grew up in Buffalo, the son of a father who worked as an autoworker and a mother who worked in retail. He got his law degree at Harvard, and he is now a co-managing partner at the corporate law firm Ropes & Gray, where he focuses on bankruptcy. Ms. James's parents fled a life of sharecropping in the South. She was raised in Brooklyn, attending public schools and, later, Howard University. She is a former prosecutor, City Council member and, for the past five years, the city's public advocate. Each candidate is appealing — and also disconcerting. For someone who has been in politics for years, Ms. James can be surprisingly ill at ease and defensive, didactic rather than persuasive, prone to plumping her record. She has tilted at windmills as public advocate, filing suits to address problems at the public housing authority that had already been fixed, for example. Mr. Wofford has promised to prosecute the corruption that has plagued Albany, including within the administration of Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But he seems unenthusiastic about challenging financial impropriety on Wall Street, an important focus for the office in recent years, and he appears less willing than Ms. James to challenge the policy excesses of President Trump, whom he supports. The Trump administration has abandoned the federal government's regulatory role, enacting policies on the environment, immigration and reproductive rights that hurt New Yorkers, and the president himself has scorned the rule of law. The state needs an attorney general who embraces the full responsibilities of the office. Ms. James has frequently said that she has worked for the powerless while Mr. Wofford has worked for the powerful. It's an easy political slogan. It's also true. And since Ms. James has pledged to use the office's powers vigorously, we endorse her for attorney general. She has a lengthy record of defending New Yorkers from special interests, beginning with her earliest work as an attorney for the Legal Aid Society. From 1999 to 2001, she led the state attorney general's Brooklyn office under Eliot Spitzer, enforcing environmental laws and investigating predatory lenders. In 2003, Ms. James was elected to the City Council, where she waged a vocal campaign against Bloomberg administration development policies she said were pricing out low and moderate-income New Yorkers. She also challenged the Bloomberg administration on the policing policy known as stop and frisk. As public advocate since 2014, she has sometimes been overzealous in her use of lawsuits to address what she sees as inequities in government. Still, her efforts have aimed at using the true power of her office — the bully pulpit — for good, especially when it comes to tenants' rights and the needs of vulnerable children. In the Democratic primary, we picked Zephyr Teachout over Ms. James. Ms. Teachout is an evangelist for ethics, and rooting out corruption is a central challenge for the next state attorney general. In her primary campaign, Ms. James presented herself as part of Mr. Cuomo's team and accepted his fund-raising, acts that raised doubts about her independence.  But Ms. James has promised to push for a law that would allow her to pursue prosecutions without first getting approval from the governor and the Legislature. This would be important if the office is to be truly independent in fighting corruption. She has also wisely said she would ask the highly experienced and capable Barbara Underwood to stay with the office. Ms. Underwood has been acting attorney general since Eric Schneiderman resigned after he was accused of abusing women he dated.  Ms. James has said that as state attorney general she would aggressively enforce environmental laws to protect the state's waterways, and would be equally vigorous in prosecuting wage theft and abuses by landlords. Some questioned her commitment to fighting financial crimes after she said she would not wear the label ""Sheriff of Wall Street"" that had been applied to Mr. Spitzer. But she has vowed to continue the office's use of the state's Martin Act, a nearly 100-year-old law that gives the attorney general broad powers to investigate and prosecute financial fraud. Mr. Wofford thinks Democratic attorneys general have used this law to generate headlines by obtaining attention-grabbing monetary settlements, rather than prosecuting serious crimes. But with Washington rolling back enforcement on many fronts, the Martin Act remains a crucial tool for the attorney general. Then there's President Trump. Mr. Wofford promises that his support for Mr. Trump would not keep him from aggressively pursuing legal action against the president if need be. He has pledged to continue the attorney general's lawsuit to block the administration from asking people who fill out the census whether they are citizens. He said it was worth looking into accusations raised by a New York Times investigation that Mr. Trump evaded millions of dollars of taxes before he became president. But Mr. Wofford said the attorney general's lawsuit against the president and his family over alleged misuse of their foundation was not worth the office's time. Yes, there are many demands on the office, but the questions about whether the Trump Foundation abused its nonprofit status to enrich the Trump family and help Mr. Trump's campaign are not frivolous. The office of attorney general has the authority to serve as a backstop if, as Mr. Trump has suggested, he fires Special Counsel Robert Mueller or pardons aides who might testify against him in the criminal investigation. If Mr. Trump took either step, we're confident that Ms. James would pursue the proper state action. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."

Here's the latest: U.S. midterms are nigh, Iranian sanctions are back and chefs look for inspiration in the Amazon. • Closing arguments in the U.S. election. Tumultuous 2018 midterm campaigns barreled through their final weekend and toward Election Day on Tuesday. The most prominent campaigners are on opposite sides of a vast political divide. President Trump has been crisscrossing the country to deliver fear-based messages on immigration and other issues. Former President Barack Obama has been assailing him in a surprisingly sharp, systematic way. Our live polling has many races too close to call, but there's a consensus in both parties that Democrats could take control of the House — while the outlook for the Senate is unclear. We have an overview of the election and scenes from around the U.S. And The Times Magazine looks at an issue shadowing the country: the rise of white nationalism and domestic terrorism, which has flummoxed law enforcement. Far-right groups are thriving online and have been emboldened since Mr. Trump took office. _____ • Sanctions have returned.  By the time you read this briefing, the United States will have reimposed severe economic sanctions on Iran and financial penalties for those who continue to import Iranian goods. Above, Iranian rials at a currency exchange shop in Basra, Iraq. The reinstated sanctions threaten to widen a rift between the U.S. and its European allies, who have criticized President Trump for abandoning the landmark 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. But the U.S. undercut its own sanctions by granting six-month waivers to eight countries — including India, South Korea, Japan and China, among the world's largest importers of Iranian oil. The E.U. did not receive an exemption. Separately, Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin, has been lobbying Washington to save his companies from Trump administration sanctions. His efforts may prove successful. _____ • In Germany, one of the longest dry spells on record has left part of the Rhine, above, at record-low levels for months, causing havoc for many European businesses. Around 80 percent of the cargo transported by ship in Germany travels the Rhine, which many freighters have had to stop plying. Gas stations reliant on the river for fuel delivery from the Netherlands have run dry, and a German chemical plant that uses the Rhine's water had to trim back production. Europeans are bracing for further instability, with one researcher predicting that because of a warming climate, ""the extremes are going to happen more often."" Separately, an environmental group has found new evidence that rogue factories in China are behind the resurgence of the banned gas CFC-11, which destroys the ozone layer and contributes to global warming. _____ • Paradise or ""Death Island""? The Thai island of Koh Tao, above, is popular with Western tourists. But at least nine European visitors have died or disappeared there since 2014, and a rape allegation by a 19-year-old British woman has raised new questions about how the police handle serious crimes against tourists. The police said they had found no evidence to support the rape allegation and arrested 12 people who had posted about it on Facebook. • McKinsey, Booz Allen Hamilton and Boston Consulting have all continued work with Saudi Arabia even as investors distance themselves after the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Above, a Saudi investment conference in Riyadh last month. • Since President Trump took office, there has been a sharp decline in financial penalties against banks and big companies accused of malpractice, a Times investigation found. • Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, bought back nearly $1 billion of its own stock during its blockbuster third quarter. • Apple's decision to limit disclosures — including how many iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells each quarter — and its disappointing forecast for fourth-quarter sales dragged down its stock. • Coming this week: BMW will publish its third-quarter earnings, and E.U. foreign ministers will meet to discuss trade relations with the U.S. and how to modernize the World Trade Organization. •  Here's a snapshot of global markets. • The London police are investigating accusations that some members of Britain's opposition Labour Party posted anti-Semitic threats online. Above, demonstrators outside the party's head office. [The New York Times] • Ross Edgley, a British man who spent five months at sea, is believed to be the first person to swim around the island of Great Britain. [The New York Times] • The husband of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman acquitted in Pakistan of blasphemy charges, appealed to Britain and other countries for asylum, saying their lives were in danger amid public demands for her execution. [Reuters] • Voters in New Caledonia, a French Pacific territory, chose to remain part of France in an independence referendum.

At least that's the idea behind the ""I Voted"" stickers handed out at polling stations in the U.S. — that they'll encourage voters to turn out, and inspire those who see them to vote themselves. (Election Day is Tuesday.) The stickers first appeared in the 1980s, offered by businesses, unions and civic groups. State and local governments began making their own. While some states keep it simple, others take the opportunity to express their identities. Some stickers, like Alabama's, Ohio's and Tennessee's, incorporate the shape of the state. Georgia's use the state's famous peach, while California's is in 13 languages. Alaskans who voted early this year got stickers with cartoon versions of state animals. Louisiana's stickers, which feature the Cajun artist George Rodrigue's iconic ""Blue Dog,"" have appeared on eBay. New York City has its own subway-themed sticker. Other cities are following Chicago's lead and offering wristbands instead. The stickers have also gone online. Instagram has ""I Voted"" and ""Yo Voté"" emblems, along with a ""We Voted"" story on Election Day that gathers posts by a user's friends. Do they actually make a difference? One study found that in 2010, Facebook's ""I Voted"" button drove 340,000 Americans to the polls. But either way, you still get a sticker.

News,2018-11-05,"Spiders like Ralph Waldo Emerson’s face. They have built a sprawling, spreading web in his left eye.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/nyregion/hall-of-fame-bronx-sculptures.html,1319," Spiders like Ralph Waldo Emerson's face. They have built a sprawling, spreading web in his left eye. That is not the only problem at something called the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, which a preservation-minded group is putting on its annual list of ""at-risk landscapes."" The group, the Cultural Landscape Foundation, says ""water damage, pollutants and the effects of weathering"" have taken a toll on the century-old structure, on the campus of what is now Bronx Community College. Perhaps it is surprising that there is even a hall of fame in the Bronx. There is a reason: The campus was built by New York University as the country was sailing toward the 20th century. It was a time of big ideas and big ideals. The Hall of Fame for Great Americans was created to celebrate those who had thought them or had held them dear, and to do so in a singularly American way. To get into the Hall, someone had to be elected. But the Hall's last election was held in 1970s. The busts of the four people chosen were, as far as anyone knows, never commissioned. The Hall of Fame, which is more of a semicircle than a hall, is an open-air gallery of statues of important Americans — or, at least, Americans who were considered important when they were chosen. And so Abraham Lincoln is across from Thomas Jefferson, which is just around a corner from George Washington. Booker T. Washington is four over from Susan B. Anthony, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wrote ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" the novel that stirred the abolitionist movement nationwide, is close by. Two were evicted last year. The statues of Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee were taken down after the clashes in Charlottesville, Va., fomented by white nationalists opposed to the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue there. The Hall of Fame's Lee had stood next to its Ulysses S. Grant for decades. Others are head-scratchers that would challenge a ""Jeopardy!"" contestant. Sylvanus Thayer? William Thomas Green Morton? Edwin Booth? Still others were the work of artists who were themselves famous. The Emerson was signed by Daniel Chester French, better known for the huge, seated Lincoln statue in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. The Lincoln in the Hall of Fame was the work of Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The Saint-Gaudens is a few steps back. Yes, there is a Saint-Gaudens in the Hall of Fame, because he was once that well known. Among many other works, Saint-Gaudens did the gleaming statue of Gen. William T. Sherman in Grand Army Plaza, at the Fifth Avenue end of Central Park. The Hall of Fame has genius inventors and generals and tunesmiths, as well as Walt Whitman, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Sidney Lanier. The Wright Brothers, Wilbur and Orville, are across from Thomas A. Edison and one over from the pioneering peanut researcher George Washington Carver, who is next to Thomas Paine. Common sense would suggest that there was no other place to put Paine, the colonial-era patriot who wrote the anti-British pamphlet ""Common Sense."" For generations, the Hall drew tourists ""like an urban Mount Rushmore,"" as well as national news coverage about who was voted in. But when Michael T. Kaufman wrote those words in The New York Times 25 years ago, he added that the Hall had ""outlived its glory, its proverbial 15 minutes."" Today, safe to say, many of the millions of annual visitors to New York — and even many New Yorkers themselves — have never heard of the place. If the Hall once reflected who's who, it has become a snapshot of who was who. Charles A. Birnbaum, the executive director of the Cultural Landscape Foundation, called the Hall a tribute to ""the changing nature of fame itself."" ""That's one of the reasons it has to endure,"" he said. ""That conversation is still going on."" The Hall is all about national identity, he added, and is ""incredibly relevant, given the national debate we're having about national greatness, national identity, how broad is that, how deep is that."" ""This was one of the touchstones of defining what American identity was."" So, the Hall was a product of a different America, in a different city, on a different campus. N.Y.U., in financial trouble in the 1970s, packed up and left, consolidating its operations around Washington Square. New York State helped out by arranging for the City University of New York to buy the campus for $62 million and turn it over to Bronx Community College, a far different kind of institution. Minorities make up 96 percent of the students at Bronx Community, according to the website Community College Review, and the majority is Hispanic. But the Hall is short on minorities and women. The faces on the statues do not show it, but the Hall has more problems than Emerson's eye. The masonry is cracked in places and crumbling in others, and, as the foundation put it, ""Many statues have deep stains from biological contaminants."" That is a delicate way of referring to bird droppings. The foundation also warns that runoff from copper in the roof has discolored the bronze tablets below the statues. The template for the tablets was the work of Louis Comfort Tiffany, the Art Nouveau genius who was the first designated design director of the jewelry store his father had started. The foundation said the cost of repairs has been estimated at $12 million, too high a price for Bronx Community College. The most urgent work would cost $1.2 million, the foundation said. ""These repairs are beyond a public college's ability to afford,"" said Richard F. Ginsberg, an interim assistant vice president of Bronx Community, adding that less than 10 percent of the college's budget goes toward capital projects, a category that includes equipment for the classrooms, as well as utilities and maintenance. Mr. Ginsberg said Bronx Community has a foundation that hopes to raise money to preserve the Hall. The architect Samuel G. White, who is involved in efforts to evaluate and renovate the library adjacent to the Hall, said the Hall of Fame was ""an afterthought"" — and, speaking of afterthoughts, this is probably the moment to note that his great-grandfather designed the Hall, the library and the rest of the campus for N.Y.U. His great-grandfather was Stanford White, who was famous as an architect and infamous for an affair with a woman who later married a jealous industrialist named Harry K. Thaw. Thaw shot him to death in a building White had designed, Madison Square Garden. As for the Hall, Mr. White said the original plan called for a semicircular museum behind the library — ""a 19th-century cabinet of curiosities, with paintings and Indian arrowheads and a giant piece of coral they still have."" But the curved structure lacked something, he said, and his great-grandfather designed a colonnade on top of what was to be the museum. ""Somebody had to come up with a use for it, and they created the Hall of Fame,"" Mr. White said. It predated the other halls of fame. As Mr. White said, ""The one in Cooperstown wasn't created until the '30s."" Mr. White's real passion is not the Hall, but the library it surrounds. The library, largely empty since N.Y.U.'s departure, needs $44 million in work, Mr. Ginsberg said, citing the same analysis that provided the repair estimate for the Hall. Now, about Sylvanus Thayer. He was an early superintendent of the United States Military Academy whom American Heritage magazine described as ""the man who made West Point."" William Thomas Green Morton? He was a 19th-century dentist whom the Hall credits with being the first to use ether as a general anesthetic, in 1846. And Edwin Booth was an actor and a 19th-century celebrity whose younger brother, John Wilkes Booth, was Lincoln's assassin. In the Hall of Fame, the Booth is just steps from the Lincoln."
News,2018-11-05,"MONT-SAINT-GUIBERT, Belgium — The migrants while away their days in Brussels at Maximilian Park, near the busy Gare du Nord, playing soccer on the durable artificial grass, checking their smartphones, dodging the police and trying to find a way to Britain.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/world/europe/belgium-migrants-volunteers.html,1220," MONT-SAINT-GUIBERT, Belgium — The migrants while away their days in Brussels at Maximilian Park, near the busy Gare du Nord, playing soccer on the durable artificial grass, checking their smartphones, dodging the police and trying to find a way to Britain. Roxane Hauzeur, a designer for a fashion house, began volunteering to help them a year ago, working with a new organization that provides housing and other assistance for the migrants, most of them from Africa and seeking asylum. She found herself swept away, transported. Ms. Hauzeur started bringing food, then giving rides, but soon she was playing host to up to five people a night in her small Brussels apartment. The experience has transformed her, she said. ""It was like a tsunami in my life,"" she said. ""You come and meet these people and you realize they're just like you."" The latest refugee crisis, which peaked in 2015, brought hundreds of thousands of migrants to Europe. And though the numbers have dropped considerably, many in Belgium, as elsewhere in Europe, see the migrants, often young and male, as a threat. Ms. Hauzeur and her fellow volunteers at Citizen's Platform for the Support of Refugees, have a different view. ""I feel ashamed of my country,"" she said. ""I heard so many times that Europe is the land of human rights, but it's not true."" Citizen's Platform was the idea of Mehdi Kassou, a 35-year-old Belgian of Moroccan ancestry who left his job with a Korean company to found the group. Roughly 7,000 Belgians volunteer there to help migrants and asylum seekers. When Mr. Kassou walks through the park, he is greeted like a rock star. He gets warm hellos, fist bumps and conversation in French and the various Arabic dialects he is trying to learn. The migrants who come to Belgium see it as their best way to slip into Britain. But they face a variety of legal complications. Under the current rules of the European Union, migrants are supposed to register and seek asylum where they first land. But hoping to move onward, they don't want to register in Belgium, or having already been registered where they landed, in Italy, Greece or Spain, they don't want to be sent back. And they have more basic needs. ""We now house about 650 people a night,"" Mr. Kassou said, 300 in a building the group got permission to use last December, serviced by some 15 employees. The rest are housed by volunteers. Mr. Kassou urges those most likely to qualify for political asylum to apply in Belgium; those who are rejected often appeal. The government estimates that only a few thousand illegal migrants are here now, and that just a few hundred roam Maximilian Park. Officially, the number of asylum seekers in Belgium in 2017 was 19,688, down from 44,760 in 2015. Asylum is granted to fewer than half of those who apply, Mr. Kassou said, but more easily to those from Syria, Eritrea and other areas torn by violence. Jails and detention centers are full, and the government is exploring renting a 300-bed prison boat from the Dutch. Some volunteers say the experience of meeting the migrants, and feeding and helping house them, has altered their own lives. Ms. Hauzeur's grandmother is from Congo; her father is half-Congolese and came to Belgium at the age of 4. Both are proud of her for her volunteer work, she said, ""even if my grandmother is jealous that I know more now about Ethiopia and Sudan than the Congo."" Another volunteer, Anne-Catherine de Neve, 45; her husband, Yves Hallet, 46; and their three children take in four to six migrants a night, five or six nights a week. One recent night, at their modest home here about 40 minutes' drive southeast of Maximilian Park, they sat down with their migrant guests to a dinner of chicken and rice. ""I want to fight against all the fascism we're seeing,"" Ms. de Neve said as she cooked. ""It's a fight for social rights, and it's quite a fight for Belgium, for Europe, for all countries."" Ms. de Neve read about the migrants in the park in the news and started volunteering a year ago. She takes in the migrants in part, she said, to educate her children. ""Now they hear, they see, and they understand something, but I think they'll have a better understanding later."" At first, she said, her oldest son, Robin, now 16, wanted to have nothing to do with the migrants. Then one day, she said, ""he called me in the park and asked: 'How many tonight? I'll make up the beds.'"" Ms. de Neve has learned something about herself, too. ""Before I would tell myself I wasn't racist,"" she said. ""It's easy to tell yourself that. Being around these migrants in my house I learned a lot about them, and about my own views."" Her husband said he had been nervous at first, even afraid. ""I worried about my children and hid my laptop,"" he recalled. No longer. ""We've lost maybe 20 euros and some headphones,"" Mr. de Neve said of the past year. ""They are very good people."" He prefers not to name his employer, but said, ""We decided that if we do nothing, then we will be responsible for what happens."" Charity has, however, created a financial strain. It has been hard for the couple to pay school fees for their own children. So they collect extra and unused food from shops and restaurants to help with the 28 or so dinners they provide every week. ""We're completely out of money,"" Ms. de Neve said, laughing. ""We'll figure it out later."" One of her guests on a recent night was a Libyan migrant named Maamar Isneebir, who is known as Omar. Now 18, Mr. Isneebir left his home in Khoms, a coastal city east of Tripoli, a year ago. He claims that when he was 11, he fought against the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. ""There is no safety now,"" he said. ""There are militias, there is ISIS."" There is also little work. Mr. Isneebir spent three days at sea, terrified, before reaching Italy, where he was registered. He then made his way to Nice, then Paris, and then to Germany for eight months. The Germans told him to return to France, and when the police came to arrest him, he said, he jumped from a window and made his way to Belgium five months ago. He had hoped to go to Britain, but now says he'd like to stay. ""It's unbelievable to have someone open their house to someone they don't know,"" Mr. Isneebir said in Arabic, translated by Mr. Kassou, who noted quietly that Libyans have only a 20 percent chance of getting political asylum here. ""They treat me like their own child."" Also at the de Neve home that night was Said Adam, 18. He comes from Darfur, and has been in Belgium nearly 10 months, he said. When Mr. Adam came to Italy by boat, he said, ""I didn't know where Belgium is."" Now, he, too, hopes to stay — though he still seems a little lost. Ms. de Neve has few illusions about how much she can do for her guests. ""I cannot help them, really,"" she said simply. ""The rules are made for them to lose."""
News,2018-11-05,The chief executive of the SoftBank Group of Japan denounced the killing of a prominent dissident in a Saudi consulate in Turkey — but said he would not cut ties with the Saudi Arabian government.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/business/softbank-son-saudi-arabia-khashoggi.html,800," The chief executive of the SoftBank Group of Japan denounced the killing of a prominent dissident in a Saudi consulate in Turkey — but said he would not cut ties with the Saudi Arabian government. The remarks by the SoftBank chief, Masayoshi Son, on Monday were his first public comments on the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who entered the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and never emerged. Turkey has said Mr. Khashoggi was beaten and tortured before being beheaded and dismembered. But Mr. Son's comments also highlight a basic fact: Despite the outrage directed at Saudi Arabia over the killing, big companies are unwilling to cut off the kingdom as a lucrative client. More than a dozen business leaders — from Mr. Son to Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase to Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber — canceled plans to attend a major Saudi business conference last month, in what was meant as a rebuke to the Saudi government. (Mr. Dimon later said that while his firm ""couldn't be seen in any way condoning"" any Saudi officials' involvement in Mr. Khashoggi's death, he acknowledged that pulling out of the gathering accomplished ""nothing."") Few companies seriously contemplated severing their contracts with Saudi clients, however. At The New York Times's DealBook conference last week, Laurence D. Fink of the investment management giant BlackRock said that it was a ""hard decision"" to withdraw from the Saudi conference. But he unapologetically defended keeping the Saudi government as a client, saying that doing business there was ""not something I'm ashamed of."" At issue are the billions of dollars that Saudi Arabia has spread around the corporate world. The country has pledged to buy nearly $110 billion worth of arms from the United States, though so far it has spent only a fraction of that. Business from Saudi Arabia constitutes at least 15 percent of the revenue of BAE Systems, the British defense contractor. And consulting firms have courted the Saudi government for years, earning hundreds of millions in fees — to the point that the country's planning ministry has been nicknamed the ""Ministry of McKinsey."" For SoftBank in particular, Saudi Arabia is a crucial part of its future. The company, a Japanese internet, energy and financial conglomerate, has increasingly staked its future on its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund. The biggest technology investment firm in the world, the Vision Fund owns stakes in Uber, the co-working space provider WeWork and more. The success of the Vision Fund has bolstered its parent's earnings. SoftBank on Monday reported a second-quarter profit of 526.4 billion yen, or $4.6 billion, up fivefold from the same time a year ago, thanks to the Vision Fund's sale of its stake in the Indian e-commerce company Flipkart to Walmart. Mr. Son said on Monday that he predicted the Vision Fund to propel even more growth at SoftBank. ""Next year, we will far exceed the scale we are seeing this year and maybe a scale that Japanese economy has never experienced before,"" he told analysts. But none of the Vision Fund's success would have been possible without the Saudis, who pledged $45 billion toward the fund. The country's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who led the investment in the Vision Fund — and who is suspected of being involved in Mr. Khashoggi's death — told Bloomberg News last month that, without his country, ""there will be no SoftBank Vision Fund."" Indeed, Mr. Son hopes to raise another Vision Fund, and it would be unclear whether that is possible without the Saudis' backing. Mr. Son said on Monday that he had raised his concerns about Mr. Khashoggi's killing with Prince Mohammed and other senior Saudi officials, asking for ""further clarity on this tragic case."" ""They said they are taking this very seriously,"" Mr. Son said. But he made it clear that he would not abandon his business interests in Saudi Arabia. ""We want to see those responsible held accountable,"" Mr. Son said during a news conference at his company's earnings presentation in Tokyo. ""At the same time, we have also accepted responsibility to the people of Saudi Arabia, an obligation we take quite seriously to help them manage their financial resources and diversify their economy."" ""As horrible as this event was, we cannot turn our backs on the Saudi people, as we work to help them in their continued efforts to reform and modernize their society,"" he said. Mr. Son said companies have not refused to accept money from his fund because of Mr. Khashoggi's killing. He said ""there are complicated issues"" in the relationships between the United States and Saudi Arabia as well as between Japan and Saudi Arabia. He added that ""as a businessman, I believe I should not be involved in the political side of such a case."""

For the rest of the list, click here.)",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/books/review/david-w-blight-frederick-douglass.html,1718," (This book was selected as one of The New York Times Book Review's 10 Best Books of 2018. For the rest of the list, click here.) FREDERICK DOUGLASS Prophet of Freedom By David W. Blight Illustrated. 888 pp. Simon & Schuster. $37.50. The alchemy that transformed an unknown fugitive slave named Frederick Douglass into one of the most celebrated orators and political theorists in the world finished its work with astonishing speed. Douglass was just 20 years old when, on Sept. 3, 1838, he dressed up as a sailor and stole out of Baltimore carrying borrowed freedom documents. He and his wife — a free black Marylander who had aided the escape — fled to New Bedford, Mass., where Douglass was recruited to the abolitionist movement while honing his oratory at a local church. As the historian David W. Blight shows in his cinematic and deeply engaging ""Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom,"" white abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison were smitten with Douglass, instantly recognizing the value of a recruit just out of chains whose eloquence refuted the claim that Negroes were inferior and who could condemn slavery as immoral by drawing on America's founding documents as well as his own bitter experience under the lash. It could not have been lost on the dapper, self-regarding Douglass that men and women swooned over him, describing him in terms that bordered on erotic. Garrison himself went starry-eyed, declaring that God had authored the young man's soul ""but a little lower than the angels."" Enraptured by the young orator in 1841, a white New England newspaper editor wrote: ""As this Douglass stood there in manly attitude, with erect form, and glistening eye and deep-toned voice, telling us that he had been secretly devising means to effect his release, we could not help thinking of Spartacus, the Gladiator."" The activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton saw him a year later at Boston's Faneuil Hall and spoke for many white women when she wrote: ""He stood there like an African prince, conscious of his dignity and power, grand in his physical proportions, majestic in his wrath, as with keen wit, satire and indignation he portrayed the bitterness of slavery."" Douglass became a marathon traveler for the abolitionist cause at a time when moving about the country by train was punishing in itself. Racist conductors worsened the ordeal by exiling him to ""mean, dirty and uncomfortable"" Negro cars or ejected him from the train altogether. Adoring crowds at some stops alternated with mobs like the one in Indiana that cried ""kill the nigger"" while beating Douglass unconscious and breaking his right hand. The itinerant orator was just seven years out of chains — and already the equivalent of a modern-day rock star — when the first of his three memoirs, ""Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave,"" made him the most well-known Negro on the globe. [ What America owes Frederick Douglass: Read David W. Blight's Op-Ed essay. ] Dependent upon abolitionist charity for his family's daily bread, Douglass nonetheless chafed under a stifling Garrisonian orthodoxy that required adherents to embrace pacifism and abstain from politics. He charted a course away from all that by starting his own newspaper and openly embracing as household saints blood-drenched figures like the slave-rebellion leader Nat Turner and the white revolutionary John Brown, both of whom he classed with the founders. His fledgling newspaper, The North Star, served as the school where he sharpened his grasp of politics and developed a penetrating style as an editorialist. By the time Abraham Lincoln was elected in 1860, Douglass understood full well that slavery could be purged from the United States only with blood — as his friend John Brown had put it on the way to the gallows — and launched blistering attacks on those who sought to compromise with the institution rather than obliterate it. Douglass thought comparatively little of Lincoln at first — describing him as ""honest"" but without claim to ""any literary culture beyond the circle of his practical duties"" — and breathed fire when Lincoln used the first-ever presidential meeting with African-Americans to promote a racist plan for colonizing Negroes outside of the country. As the Civil War raged toward conclusion, Douglass attacked Lincoln for vacillating on black rights in the South. Wounded, the president summoned him to the White House and sought his help with the war effort. By this point, the man who had slipped out of Baltimore with borrowed freedom papers was poised to play a central role in America's postwar transformation. The novelist William Burroughs once complained about autobiographers who conceal their lives in print, quipping that the Paul Bowles memoir ""Without Stopping"" would have been better titled ""Without Telling."" Blight makes a similar case against Douglass, who shrouded his domestic life in secrecy even as he wrote and rewrote his personal story in three widely read autobiographies that totaled more than 1,200 pages. ""Douglass invited us into his life over and over,"" Blight writes, ""and it is a rich literary and historical feast to read the music of Douglass's words. But as he sits majestically at the head of the table, it is as if he slips out of the room right when we so wish to know more — anything — about his more private thoughts, motivations and memories of the many conflicts in his personal life."" Douglass cultivated the fiction that he was ""self-made"" and had sprung fully formed from his own forehead. Blight dismantles this pretense in a tour de force of storytelling and analysis, showing that the young orator-to-be had benefited from a great deal of mentorship and good fortune. Viewed through this lens, the fabled escape from slavery takes on different contours. The slave master's decision not to sell the rebellious young Fred into a living death in the Deep South — and instead to consign him to the custody of a brother in Baltimore — can be credibly seen as an act of familial grace by a slave owner toward a half-white member of his extended family. Among those in the free black community of Baltimore who embraced Fred and propelled him toward freedom was his wife-to-be, the housekeeper Anna Murray. Blight draws on new archival material and insights gleaned from a lifetime in the company of his subject to shed light on the orator's complex relationship with his wife, Anna, and the two white women who came between the couple within the walls of the Douglass family home in Rochester. The great man's vocation as a wandering oracle was possible because Anna, who bore five children (only four lived to adulthood), ran the household with a sure hand, hosting fugitive slaves, far-flung relatives and others who turned up at the front door in need. Anna, whom Blight describes as ""largely illiterate,"" could be of little help with her husband's journalism. For that, the charismatic orator called up the British abolitionist Julia Griffiths, who put aside her life and moved in 1849 to be with him in Rochester and to get The North Star off the ground. She enabled Douglass to survive personally and professionally, managing and raising money for the newspaper and for the food that came across the Douglass family table. She helped ""to polish a raw genius into a gem and, for a time, managed his emotional health as well as his bank accounts."" Together with her sister, Eliza, Griffiths relieved the Douglasses of an enormous financial burden by purchasing the mortgage of the family home. White Rochester was scandalized when Griffiths moved into the Douglass home, an arrangement that spawned rumors of a romantic link between patron and orator. It is alleged that she moved out when Anna ""ordered it."" That Griffiths loved Douglass is clear on the face of things, but any claim that the two carried on a sexual relationship right under Anna's nose seems far-fetched. The eccentric German intellectual Ottilie Assing was another matter. She wandered into the Douglasses' lives in 1856, seeking permission to translate his second autobiography, ""My Bondage and My Freedom,"" into German. She remained in the family orbit for nearly three decades, serving as confidante and interlocutor — and lover. Douglass frequented her rooms in Hoboken, N.J., where the participants of her salon lionized him, validating his rise from slavery into the thinking classes. Assing shielded him when he was on the run from conspiracy charges in connection with John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, when he came within a hairbreadth of being captured and marched to the gallows with his revolutionary friend. That Assing was obsessed with the famous orator would have been readily apparent to Anna during the interloper's frequent intrusion on the family home, where she lived for months at a time. We know nothing of Anna's feelings on the matter — but the triangle of Frederick, Anna and the love-struck Ottilie comes through like the plot of an Edith Wharton novel. At different points, Assing referred to Anna as a ""veritable beast"" who kept her from her beloved Frederick, and as the ""border state"" that prevented her from advancing toward her heart's true goal. As Blight writes, ""Although Assing sipped tea occasionally with Mrs. Douglass, she held Anna in utter contempt, disrespecting her lack of education and even at times privately denigrating her role as homemaker."" The amorous German lingered in Douglass's circle year after year, waiting in vain for the divorce that would allow her to ""walk tall as the rightful 'Mrs. Douglass.'"" By the time Anna died in 1882, Assing was bitterly aware that the aging orator intended to marry Helen Pitts, a well-educated white woman in her 40s, who worked for Douglass in the recorder of deeds office in Washington. The nearly 66-year-old Douglass held the plan secret even from his children, with whom he also worked daily, and who seem to have learned of the marriage from press inquiries. He failed to notify his faithful British friend Julia, who received the news secondhand from friends in Rochester. Gracious as usual, she wished the newlyweds well and hoped that the union would give him ""true happiness"" in the evening of his days. Later that year, Assing killed herself in a Paris park — drinking potassium cyanide — leaving her beloved a tidy sum in her will."
News,2018-11-05,"When I was 15, I met a dancer from Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet.

The company had come to Los Angeles to dance in the Olympic Arts Festival, and my parents volunteered to host a post-performance dinner in our backyard. I recall about 200 people — family friends, Olympic officials and maybe 25 dancers — eating curry (is that right?) off paper plates. But that's not what this is about. No, this is about the ballerino — my word for him — I met and what he represented to a lonely gay kid in Southern California in 1984, a kid who had never before met another gay person. Earlier that evening, I had seen the dancer turn, leap and smile onstage, expressing through the mute language of ballet who he was. Something about his movement told me he was gay, and I felt he was dancing not only for himself but for me. Onstage, the ballerino wore brown tights that showed the trunks of his thighs, and everything else. Now he was in loose linen pants with a drawstring belt and an open collar that exposed the rod of his clavicle. He said hello. I could barely speak. He might have said, ""Lovely party,"" but that was it, he was on his way. The isolation of my queer youth was about to return. Out of nowhere, I told him he was my favorite ballet dancer in the world. He seemed startled, and a little embarrassed, but he came to understand what I was trying to say: ""If you need someone to talk to, you can write me, care of the Ballet."" The next day, I rode my bike to the library and looked up the address in Winnipeg and sent a letter trying to express something about myself I had never expressed before. Two months later, he wrote back, apologizing: He'd been on tour. Although time has devoured that sheet of paper, I still remember the gentle message embedded in his words: One day, you too will find yourself. On a muggy afternoon in Harlem, Preston Chamblee, 23, a member of New York City Ballet since 2015, says to me, ""I hope to be part of a generation that can change the boundaries of what ballet can do, a generation that says we're going to represent everyone, not just the stories that have been told before."" We're looking at a Facebook video of Chamblee and his fellow company member Taylor Stanley, 27, in a romantic pas de deux in the choreographer Lauren Lovette's ""Not Our Fate."" The ballet depicts a love story between two men of color not as subtext but as central narrative. When it premiered last fall at New York's David H. Koch Theater, it sent a jolt of relevance through an art form that often feels mired in another era. It's a thrilling duet, both men in white T-shirts and black pants moving toward and away from each other, embracing and rejecting and succumbing to desire and love. Rather than putting a man into a woman's role, Lovette choreographed the piece for two men; the audience can see the dancers negotiating their positions, just as queer couples negotiate theirs. (I showed the clip to a gay friend, who said, ""That basically sums up my relationship with my boyfriend."") Men have danced together before in ballet, typically in expressions of friendship or rivalry, such as the death duet between Tybalt and Mercutio in ""Romeo and Juliet,"" first choreographed in Czechoslovakia by Ivo Vana Psota in 1938. We've seen choreographers invert genders, often casting men as Cinderella's evil stepsisters for a laugh. Yet Chamblee had never performed a pas de deux explicitly depicting two men in love. Shortly after ""Not Our Fate"" premiered, Justin Peck, City Ballet's resident choreographer, further challenged ballet's gender norms when he adapted the woman's role in the pas de deux at the heart of his 2017 ""The Times Are Racing,"" pairing Stanley with Daniel Applebaum, a 32-year-old gay soloist with the company. If you didn't know much about classical ballet, you might think it's an obvious home for queer artists and narratives, but it's more complicated than that: Ballet, of course, has always had gay dancers and choreographers and homoeroticism, but it's an artistic discipline shaped by tradition. The canon is small; the institutions are formal and steeped in history; and the masters who cast the principal male roles — Romeo, Don Quixote, Prince Siegfried in ""Swan Lake"" — sometimes select dancers who embody the conventional male hero, onstage and off. To have a public queer identity, or to be perceived as too effeminate, can still affect a dancer's ability to land these lead roles. It's one of ballet's ironies — the outside world has long viewed the male dancer as the antithesis of conventional masculinity, yet the culture inside ballet can still be somewhat bro-y. (A recent lawsuit by a female dancer against City Ballet, three of its former male principals and a financial donor, who were accused of sharing sexually explicit images of female dancers, cites the company's ""fraternity-like atmosphere,"" which City Ballet denies.) This is one reason ""Not Our Fate"" means so much to Chamblee. For the first time, he says, ""I really got to be absolutely nobody but myself onstage."" Chamblee is part of a new generation of dancers who are collapsing the boundaries between queerness and maleness in ballet by challenging its, and the culture's, preconceived ideas of masculinity. They use social media, especially Instagram, to express themselves creatively and corporeally, building an audience much larger than what a company alone can bring them. Their work onstage and online rejects the idea that a male dancer must store his queerness in his locker. They see no contradiction in the serious artist who dances on ballet's largest stages and also posts videos of himself, say, dancing on a treadmill in platform heels. In doing so, these dancers are taking some of the starch out of ballet. Last June, London's Royal Ballet hung the rainbow flag outside its historic home for the first time. For Marcelino Sambé, 24, a soloist at the company, ""it tells everyone it's an open institution. Come on in.""  13 Photos View Slide Show › There's a hashtag for everything on Instagram; when you type #gayballet, you will come across men in tights and training shorts, and eventually you might find James Whiteside, most likely bare-chested with a large scratch tattooed on his ribs. Whiteside, 34, is a principal dancer with New York's American Ballet Theater and, since joining the company in 2012, one of its major stars; critics applaud his power and energy and the depth he brings to his characters. For the choreographer Lar Lubovitch's 2015 production of ""Othello,"" Whiteside didn't want to waste the opportunity of working with a gay collaborator — his Iago was infused with what he calls ""queer rage."" This month, at New York's Joyce Theater, Whiteside opened the celebrated choreographer Arthur Pita's new ballet, ""The Tenant,"" based on Roland Topor's 1964 French novel and Roman Polanski's film adaptation of the same name, which questions ideas of identity and gender. ""My personality was maybe something that ABT hadn't encountered before,"" Whiteside says. ""I would come in 'yaass kween'-ing everyone and doing drag queen walks, and that could have been so easily misconstrued as not taking the work seriously."" But Whiteside takes his work very seriously because he doesn't want to, as he puts it, go back. Back to his late teens in South Boston when people regularly threw rocks at him and called him the F-word on his way to and from Boston Ballet. ""I found myself a target anywhere I went,"" he says. Like anyone who's danced through fire and come out burnished, Whiteside can now laugh at his past and turn it into a personal statement and meta joke on Instagram. In one post, he's flexing his biceps while wearing a pink bandanna, a black tutu and a tank top that says ""Milk's Gym"" (Milk is the drag name of his boyfriend, Daniel Donigan, who appeared on two seasons of ""RuPaul's Drag Race""). Whiteside's caption: ""Masc femme butch kween horse peasant monarch wealthy broke realness."" Then a shrugging-guy emoji. What he hears most from his 171,000 Instagram followers is that he looks like he's having fun. And he is. Dancing with ABT has been his dream since he was a boy, when he attended a gala and visited the principals' red-velvet hallway backstage. He loves ballet and wants others to fall in love with it, too, and he hopes his feed will bring more people into the theater. But it bugs him that so much of ballet Instagram — his own at times, too — is ""dancer thirst trap."" The twerking and the tights and the belts are a misleading representation of the work, the almost inhuman physical effort behind a dancer doing splits in the air. ""No one's going to understand what we really do from Instagram, where everything has a smile on it and a cigarette in its mouth,"" he says. ""Ballet is one of the most physically demanding things in the world, but you have to seem like you're just taking a whiz."" Whiteside has a point. But like any protagonist, he can't see himself as we do. Before social media, ballet on video — think of those tame PBS broadcasts — appealed to a specialized audience. One reason is its perspective: The cameras, way up in the auditorium, show ballet from a limited point of view. But on Instagram, the close-up angles, taped ankles, the veins and arteries flooded with blood, give us ballet as the dancer experiences it. Rather than removing the magic of a darkened theater, this intimacy brings us closer to the my-God-how-does-the-human-body-do-that awe that ballet inspires. In one post, we see Whiteside's backside, naked but for the straps of a well-worn dance belt. But this isn't just a thirst trap. It's a hard, strangely shaped, almost gnarled piece of flesh. The caption — ""Dancer butt"" — tells us we're looking at decades of sacrifice knotted up in muscle and skin. It shows us the feat behind the art, reminding us that the foundation of dance is physical strength — a quality associated with traditional masculinity. Whiteside is an athlete-artist restless with ideas and energy, and Instagram gives him a space arguably bigger than a company's stage to experiment with what it now means to be a great dancer. Harper Watters, 26, is many things: acclaimed Houston Ballet soloist; son of two former college professors; host of a backstage chat show called ""The Pre Show"" on his YouTube channel; a black gay man from New Hampshire now living in Texas; a lean, inventive artist who dances with the freedom that comes from knowing who you are; a devourer of pop culture. On his website, he calls himself the Wendy Williams of ballet. When I talk to him, he elaborates: ""If Wendy Williams and Beyoncé had a love child who they put in ballet, it would 100 percent be me."" In one episode of ""The Pre Show,"" filmed behind the scenes of a performance of ""Swan Lake"" in Minneapolis, he and his fellow dancer Hayden Stark sit at the mirror applying their characters' makeup while talking about college, sex, queer persecution in Russia and facial hair. In many ways, this could be a live-stream of two young gay men getting ready for a night out at the bars, but over the course of the 16.5-minute segment, the dancers transform into their ballet roles. Dressed as a swan hunter, Watters talks to the camera in a butch tone and says he and Stark are about to go out and do ""boy things"" like seducing women and fighting, but then they laugh and return to their natural voices — distinctly, unapologetically gay — and clarify, ""a different kind of boy thing."" If ballet feels remote to many, especially younger people, this type of access and authenticity connects the medium to today's cultural currents. Watters says he's influenced as much by classical ballet as by reality television, including ""America's Next Top Model"" and ""RuPaul's Drag Race."" He's faced some backlash online about how he ""represents"" the Houston Ballet, which he joined as an apprentice in 2011, but that criticism seems out of step with what the word ""representation"" now means in our culture. ""The Pre Show"" is ostensibly about a dancer preparing for his roles, but its subtext is stereotypes — an artist owning, defying and subverting them as part of the process of becoming himself. Two years ago, before his promotion to demisoloist, a director taught Watters an important lesson: Ballet isn't really about how high your legs can go or how many turns you can do, but what you're trying to say about yourself and the world. Every step has to have intention. As a ballet student in Sweden, the dancer Pontus Lidberg, 41, had a hypermasculine, almost cartoonish notion of what a ballerino should be — the guy who pulls up to the theater on a motorcycle, muscles his way through ""Quixote"" and caps off the evening with a ballerina. This was the dominant narrative in the 1990s, when only a few male dancers were openly gay. He sees it as part of the aftermath of the AIDS epidemic that killed so many artists, including, in 1993, ballet's global celebrity, Rudolf Nureyev, who cracked the door to his closet but never fully emerged from it. ""I had no role models,"" Lidberg says. ""I had to create that myself."" Lidberg has since become a leading choreographer around the world, developing works for companies such as City Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet. In his latest piece, ""Siren,"" performed in October at the Joyce, he flips the genders in Homer's ""Odyssey."" Ulysses is a woman, and the sirens — the original temptations — are men. Its central theme is that existential desire to connect. Like the dancers he mentors, Lidberg is part of a cohort of choreographers (some of whom are straight) expanding ballet by telling new stories, which includes Peck, Lovette and Joshua Beamish, whose 2015 piece ""Burrow"" depicts the arc of a relationship between two men, set to the music of the 20th-century Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Last year, the Russian choreographer Yuri Possokhov's ballet for Moscow's Bolshoi Theater, based on the life of Nureyev, was postponed two days before its world premiere. The authorities arrested its director on suspicion of embezzling government funds, although many suspect the ballet's frankness about its subject's sexuality might have been the real issue. ""Nureyev"" opened five months later. (Possokhov declined to comment for this story.) Watching ballet is ultimately ephemeral — ""an experience that can never be relived,"" Lidberg says. So, too, is the body, especially the dancer's. ""Aging is very real, and for the dancer, it happens very quickly."" Rather than lamenting this, he embraces it, filming his work and releasing it on social media. In his 2007 ballet film, ""The Rain,"" he dances a pas de deux with a close male friend in a downpour to Doris Day's ""Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps"" (1965). ""My identity as a gay man has many layers,"" Lidberg adds. He also tries to convey something he rarely sees in ballet — not just sexuality, but companionship and tenderness between men. In other words, love. ""I am a ballerina,"" says Chase Johnsey. ""That's what I've done my whole career."" Johnsey, 33, danced principal female roles en pointe for more than a decade with Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, the all-male ballet comedy, but he left the company at the end of last year, after he began to identify as gender fluid. Johnsey, who uses male pronouns, says he and others felt harassed because ""we don't live up to some masculine ideal of what a gay man is."" (Trockadero says Johnsey's claims were investigated and no evidence to support them was found.) Growing up in what he calls ""the swamps of Florida,"" Johnsey remembers watching the ballerinas in class and wanting nothing more than to dance like them. An essential part of queerness is fluidity — between identities, expectations, definitions and that word no one likes, labels. And what is dance if not fluid — in motion, in music, in the blend between physical and artistic? Ballet is most powerful when it is most fluid. So, too, is the dancer, when he, or she, or they, moves fluidly. A dancer must move between roles — now Romeo, now a prince, now a ruby — just as a queer person moves between roles, finding comfort and creativity in that movement. But classical ballet isn't fluid. It's rigid with custom and stiff with history. ""You have all these people who love the way it's been for 200 years,"" Johnsey says. Johnsey made history this past June by dancing in the female corps in ""The Sleeping Beauty"" with English National Ballet. His dream now: to play the lead, Odette, in a major company's production of ""Swan Lake,"" not as female but as gender fluid, which he defines as identifying as male in some contexts and female in others. He sees the artistic potential of bringing this to a character who transforms from swan to human and back. ""If art reflects the state of the world, then I'm in the right place at the right time,"" he says. It would seem that way: Lukas Dhont's movie ""Girl,"" about a 15-year-old transgender ballerina, is Belgium's much-lauded entry for the upcoming Academy Awards. And a revival of Matthew Bourne's now-legendary 1995 ""Swan Lake,"" which features all-male swans, will open next month in London. But since the final curtain at the London Coliseum, Johnsey's phone hasn't rung. He now mentors young transgender and gender-nonconforming dancers. ""I'll probably never dance leading roles again,"" he says, ""but I don't care because there are so many kids out there who contact me on Instagram who think they don't have a fighting chance. I can give them that."" Every dancer I spoke with has a story of how their art touched someone in unexpected ways, just as the ballerino from Winnipeg gave me something I could carry far into my future. Art is nothing if it does not connect, and these dancers are connecting with people who might previously have thought ballet could not, or would not, speak for them. Whiteside tells me about a letter he received from a woman who thinks her young son is gay. The boy loves to dance, the mother writes, and wants to be like Whiteside when he grows up. His classmates make fun of him for loving ballet, but the mother is proud of her son for staying resolute; seeing Whiteside become successful gives her hope as a parent. ""I wrote her back and said that was me — headstrong little effeminate gay kid,"" Whiteside says. He keeps the letter in his locker with his tights and his shoes, and when he thinks of it, he marvels: ""You have no idea what you're doing, and then someone's a little more O.K. because of what you did.""

briefing,2018-11-05, (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/briefing/midterm-elections-the-walking-dead-nfl.html,1377,"  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: President Trump and candidates around the country spent the weekend making their final pitches to voters before Tuesday's midterm elections. Here's the latest. While Mr. Trump is not on the ballot, many view the elections as an opportunity to assess his leadership, and the results will affect the remainder of his term. • News analysis: Dozens of House races are exceptionally close, recent polls by The Times and Siena College show. As a result, modest shifts among undecided voters or a slightly higher turnout could yield significantly different outcomes. Democrats would have to flip 23 Republican-held seats to gain control of the chamber. • The Tip Sheet: Our daily analysis of the elections looks at where things stand. • In Georgia: Brian Kemp, the secretary of state and the Republican nominee for governor, said that Democrats were under investigation for allegedly trying to hack the state's voter registration files. Democrats called the inquiry a political stunt. As President Trump and his allies waged a fear-based campaign to drive Republican voters to the polls, far-right communities online have seen their once-fringe views given prominent support. ""I've seen white supremacists and extremists talk about these anti-Semitic and racist ideas for years,"" said Oren Segal, the director of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. ""But it was always in the corner. Now, you don't know where the mainstream starts and the fringe ends."" • Tracing a meme: In less than two weeks, the phrase ""jobs not mobs"" moved from the right-wing internet onto some of the most prominent political stages in the country. • Election misinformation: Two months ago, The Times asked readers to send in examples of election-related misinformation. Here's how they responded. • From the Magazine: White supremacists and other far-right extremists have killed far more people since Sept. 11, 2001, than any other category of domestic extremists. But U.S. counterterrorism strategy has ignored the rising danger. Oleg Deripaska has spent two decades trying to buy respect in the West. London has welcomed him; Washington hasn't, really. Suspected by the U.S. of having ties to organized crime, Mr. Deripaska is on a list of Russians who faced sanctions from the Trump administration as punishment for Russian interference in the 2016 election. • Coming decision: The administration is nearing a deadline next month for a final ruling on sanctions against Mr. Deripaska's companies. There are signs that he could escape them entirely. Brent Taylor, the mayor of North Ogden, Utah, told his constituents in January that he would go to Afghanistan to train an Afghan commando battalion. It was his fourth deployment. Major Taylor, 39, was killed on Saturday, apparently by one of the people he was there to help. He leaves behind a wife and seven children. His body is scheduled to arrive at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware this evening. • The Afghan war: Major Taylor's death was a reminder that there's no end in sight for the 17-year conflict. • After another strong jobs report, our chief economics correspondent looked at how the financial lives of the middle class have changed in the past two years. It's a mixed picture. • President Xi Jinping of China kicked off a major trade show in Shanghai today intended to show the country's appetite for foreign goods. Notably absent were the leaders of Britain, Germany, Japan and South Korea, and the U.S. didn't send an official delegation at all. • American sanctions on Iranian oil resumed this morning. It's one of the headlines to watch this week. • More than 250 antiquarian book dealers in 24 countries are pulling over a million books off an Amazon-owned site for a week after the site abruptly banned sellers from several nations. • U.S. stocks were down on Friday. Here's a snapshot of global markets today. Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Parents shouldn't spank their children, the American Academy of Pediatrics said today. It's the group's most strongly worded warning against corporal punishment. • Create a holiday table setting that avoids clichés. • Recipe of the day: Pack a lunch of farro salad with beets, their greens and feta. • Shabbat services across the U.S., the first since a gunman killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, drew people of all faiths. • A gunman with a history of misogyny and racism killed two women and injured five other people at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, Fla. He then killed himself. • The Los Angeles Rams lost their first game of the season, to the New Orleans Saints. Here are the highlights from Week 9 in the N.F.L. • A British man who spent five months at sea is believed to be the first person to swim around Britain. • ""The Walking Dead"" had an end-of-series feel in its latest episode. We spoke to Andrew Lincoln about it. (Spoilers, obviously.) • ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" overcame lackluster reviews to earn about $50 million and the top spot at the domestic box office. • A marathon in photographs The New York City Marathon on Sunday involved 50,000 runners, 12,000 volunteers and hundreds of thousands of spectators. Here's what it looked like. Mary Keitany of Kenya won the women's race for the fourth time, finishing in 2 hours 22 minutes 48 seconds. Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia won the men's race for the first time, in 2:05:59. • In memoriam Roy Hargrove, a virtuoso trumpeter, became a symbol of jazz's youthful renewal in the early 1990s, and established himself as one of the most respected musicians of his generation. He was 49. • Dancers, and shoes, of color Some ballet performers paint or dye shoes to match their skin color. But they soon might not have to. • Quotation of the day ""Hey, we're in politics. What did people think they were going to, a tea party?"" — Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader, on how she responds to members of her party who say they won't support her for speaker if Democrats win a majority of seats on Tuesday. • The Times, in other words Here's an image of today's front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. • What we're reading Jenna Wortham, a writer for The Times, recommends this piece from Guernica: ""What does it feel like when everything familiar disappears? This short story is technically science fiction, but it feels unnervingly close to reality."" Stickers can be surprisingly motivating, even for adults. That's the idea behind the ""I Voted"" stickers handed out at polling stations — that they'll encourage voters to turn out, and inspire those who see them to vote themselves. The stickers first appeared in the 1980s, offered by businesses, unions and civic groups. State and local governments began making their own. While some states keep them simple, others express their identities. Some stickers, like Alabama's, Ohio's and Tennessee's, incorporate the shape of the state. Georgia's include  a peach, while California's is in 13 languages. Alaskans who voted early this year got stickers with cartoon versions of state animals. Louisiana's stickers, which feature the Cajun artist George Rodrigue's ""Blue Dog,"" have appeared on eBay. New York City has a subway-themed sticker. Other cities are following Chicago's lead and offering wristbands instead. The stickers have also transformed online. Instagram has ""I Voted"" and ""Yo Voté"" emblems, along with a ""We Voted"" story on Election Day that gathers posts by a user's friends. Do they actually make a difference? One study found that in 2010, Facebook's ""I Voted"" button drove 340,000 Americans to the polls. Either way, you still get a sticker.

Six months later, The People won; voters overwhelmingly passed a penny-per-ounce tax on sugary drinks, designed to combat rising rates of diabetes and obesity. For years, California state legislators had killed attempts to tax sugary beverages, beholden to an industry that donated millions to political campaigns. The success of the San Francisco soda tax, along with similar ballot measures in three other Bay Area cities, energized a national movement and spurred new drives to tax soda in municipalities around California. The campaigns drew on the legacy and spirit of Hiram Johnson, the governor who championed direct democracy and led California to adopt the initiative, referendum and recall. Just as Governor Johnson had delivered in 1911 on his promise to give people tools to break free from the monopoly of the Southern Pacific Railroad, a century later the people would circumvent the State Legislature by taking their fight against the soda industry directly to the voters. Then the soda industry fought back — using Hiram Johnson's favorite weapon. Early this year, the beverage industry spent more than $7 million gathering enough signatures to put an initiative on the ballot that would require a two-thirds vote to pass any local tax. Such a change would wreak havoc with municipal finances, and the specter gave the industry leverage to get what it really wanted: In June, the initiative was withdrawn, in exchange for a state law that bars local governments from imposing any new soda taxes through 2030. The high-stakes trade was the latest escalation in California's initiative-industrial complex, in which wealth and stealth often subvert the goals of Hiram Johnson's reforms. With enough money, almost anything can get on the California ballot. Over the last century, particularly the last four decades, initiatives have shaped nearly every facet of life in California. Ballot propositions, which can be amended only by another popular vote, have determined how property taxes are levied, the fate of bilingual education and even the size of chickens' cages (and thus the price of eggs). When Hiram Johnson took office, amid rampant corruption, the Southern Pacific Railroad held so much power it was known as the fourth branch of government. ""While I do not by any means believe the initiative, the referendum and the recall are the panacea for all our political ills,"" Governor Johnson said in his 1911 inaugural address, ""they do give to the electorate the power of action when desired, and they do place in the hands of the people the means by which they may protect themselves."" Today, those tools are expertly wielded by the moneyed interests whose power they were designed to counteract. California is one of 24 states that allow voters to initiate laws through the petition process. A proposed law can be placed on the ballot with signatures equal to 5 percent of the total gubernatorial vote in the last election; a constitutional amendment requires 8 percent. In 1912, measures qualified with 30,857 signatures; by the 21st century, the number topped half a million. In the early decades, only a handful of initiatives reached the ballot. By the 1930s, the nation's first political consultants, Clem Whitaker and Leone Baxter, began to carve out a niche business, handling 65 initiative campaigns over 15 years.  Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Baxter, and the political-consultant industry they spawned, fueled a rapid growth in initiatives by the 1970s. Paid signature gatherers driven by financial incentive rather than moral conviction replaced volunteers who had once circulated petitions for their causes. The initiative ""is very rapidly becoming a tool of the special interests,"" Jerry Brown, then the secretary of state, testified at a 1972 state hearing where signature gatherers detailed a range of deceptive practices. The last initiative that got on the ballot through the effort of volunteers was a 1990 measure to protect mountain lions. Since then, petition gatherers wielding multiple clipboards have become ubiquitous at shopping malls, outside retail stores and at farmers' markets. They are paid per signature, rates that fluctuate as high as $6 per name, depending on how many initiatives are in circulation, how soon the petitions must be turned in and how difficult the sell. Signature gatherers who handle multiple initiatives have an incentive to push the ones that pay the most. The bidding wars and campaign high jinks can be fierce. They have included attempts to sabotage petitions by flooding them with false or duplicate names. As governor, Mr. Brown has vetoed several recent attempts to amend the process, principally by outlawing a fee-per-signature payment. While he acknowledged the propensity for manipulation, he argued that the per-signature system remains the cheapest. ""Eliminating this option will drive up the cost of circulating ballot measures, thereby further favoring the wealthiest interests,"" he wrote in a veto message. Mr. Brown has had more experience with initiatives than most. In his first campaign for governor in 1974, he piggybacked on a popular initiative he had crafted, the Political Reform Act, which established a commission to to regulate campaign finances, lobbying and ethics. Four years later, he was caught in the swirl of Proposition 13, the tax cut measure that remains the most far-reaching initiative in modern times. Like most elected officials, Mr. Brown opposed Prop 13, but then embraced it enthusiastically when it passed. Since his return to the governor's office in 2011, he has mastered the art of using initiatives to further his priorities. He devised and campaigned for measures that raised taxes, created a rainy-day fund and made major changes to the criminal-justice system. He has also amassed funds to fight off attempts to undo policies or hamper his objectives, learning from the experience of Prop 13, when such tactics were not yet in vogue. He has helped fend off ballot challenges to criminal-justice reforms and efforts to block his plans for high-speed rail. This year, he has helped fight a proposition on the November ballot that would repeal a recently enacted gas tax that funds highway repairs. Such campaigns are costly, in part because there are no limits on contributions. This November, in addition to the gas tax, voters will decide measures that affect issues including rent control, bonds for water projects and homeless housing, the size of cages for farm animals and the future of daylight saving time. As of the end of October, the amount raised to pass or defeat the 11 propositions was almost $368 million, about five times the amount raised by this year's two gubernatorial candidates.

News,2018-11-06,Wanted: Twelve people who can take four months off work and who don’t mind sitting in judgment of a man said to be the most notorious criminal of the 21st century. Payment: About $40 a day.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/nyregion/el-chapo-trial-jury.html,718," Wanted: Twelve people who can take four months off work and who don't mind sitting in judgment of a man said to be the most notorious criminal of the 21st century. Payment: About $40 a day. Picking a jury is always hard, but it is even more so when the defendant on trial is Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the former head of the Sinaloa drug cartel, a man accused of trafficking drugs by the ton and of having a hand in at least 30 murders. Mr. Guzman — known to the world as El Chapo — is such a fearsome figure that earlier this year, the judge in the case ruled that the jury would remain anonymous and would be escorted for their safety to and from the court each day by United States Marshals. [Read more about the unusual security measures being employed at the trial.] Still, as jury selection started Monday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, it was largely smooth sailing as the potential jurors seemed to evince little fear of the man who sat across from them, silent but watchful, in a navy blue suit and a crisp white shirt that was open to his sternum. Amid questions about their views on marijuana, their feelings about law enforcement and their fluency in Spanish, only one said that she was afraid of Mr. Guzman. Another admitted that the words ""El Chapo"" mostly made him think about a bagel sandwich served by a deli near his workplace that was named for the defendant. A third spent most of his time as he was questioned talking about his job as a Michael Jackson impersonator. Many of the jurors said they recognized Mr. Guzman's name and had at least heard that he was an international kingpin who had famously escaped from two Mexican prisons. Of the 46 people questioned on Monday by Judge Brian M. Cogan, 17 were dismissed, most of them because they said they could not be fair to Mr. Guzman or because the long trial would cause a financial hardship. Security was exceedingly tight. The courthouse was guarded by marshals, local court officers, a bomb-sniffing dog and a heavily armed tactical team of New York City police officers. Precautions like these apparently unnerved one potential juror, who admitted that the prospect of deciding Mr. Guzman's fate made her feel ""unsafe."" ""What scares me is I read that his family will come after jurors and their families,"" the woman said. She added that she knew that Mr. Guzman had two sons who were still at large. When a defense lawyer asked her if that made her nervous, she admitted that it did. Several prospective jurors said they were familiar with Mr. Guzman from the Netflix series ""El Chapo"" or had seen his page on Wikipedia, but they seemed largely unaware that he had been charged almost a decade ago with running a criminal enterprise that smuggled cocaine and heroin into the United States from Mexico in a rotating fleet of cars, trucks, yachts, planes and submarines. Mr. Guzman also stands accused of protecting his empire by murdering — or ordering the deaths of — dozens of people. [Read about some of the cooperating witnesses expected to testify.] Opening arguments are scheduled to begin next Tuesday, assuming a jury has been picked. Prosecutors are expected to offer up the epic tale of Mr. Guzman's rise from a teenage marijuana farmer to a ruthless kingpin who bribed officials in Mexico and often toted a gold-plated assault rifle. The jury will also likely hear about his two daring jailbreaks — one, at least according to lore, while hidden in a laundry cart and the other through a mile-long tunnel his associates dug into the shower of his cell. But the sobering facts at the heart of the case did not preclude jury selection from veering at times into the absurd. There was, after all, the juror who noted that his local deli had a sandwich called the ""El Chapo."" William Purpura, one of Mr. Guzman's lawyers, wanted to explore this coincidence, asking what precisely the sandwich was made of. It was, as it turned out, a bagel with cream cheese, capers and lox, the man explained. ""I don't know why it's called the 'El Chapo,'"" he said, ""but it's delicious."""
News,2018-11-06,"President Trump is wrong to equate the Democrats’ positions on immigration with open borders. Although they largely oppose his border wall, his calls to limit legal immigration and his family separation policy, Democratic lawmakers support border security measures.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/us/politics/fact-check-trump-rally-ohio-indiana-missouri.html,954," What Trump Said ""Donnelly also supports open borders."" — At a campaign rally on Monday in Fort Wayne, Ind. President Trump is wrong to equate the Democrats' positions on immigration with open borders. Although they largely oppose his border wall, his calls to limit legal immigration and his family separation policy, Democratic lawmakers support border security measures. Mr. Trump is even more wrong when he accuses Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, of supporting open borders, as Mr. Donnelly has often sided with Republicans and the White House on immigration. In February, Mr. Donnelly voted for a hard-line immigration bill supported by the White House that included funding for Mr. Trump's wall, and he also voted to defund so-called sanctuary cities. (Those legislative efforts failed.) Mr. Donnelly said in August that progressive calls to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency were ""a terrible idea,"" and said that ""it's important that we have strong, and safe, and secure borders, and ICE is a part of that."" In 2016, Mr. Donnelly voted for ""Kate's Law,"" which seeks harsher penalties on immigrants who re-enter the United States illegally after being deported. Mr. Trump often vows to secure its passage on the campaign trail.  NumbersUSA, a group that supports restricting immigration, gave Mr. Donnelly a ""C"" for his positions in recent years — tied with or higher than the grades for 10 Republican senators and all but one Democratic senator. What Trump Said ""He also had a big scandal — spent nearly $250 million of federal money to renovate a headquarters agency that the government doesn't even own, to lease, and more than twice what the entire building was worth, and the escalators or the elevators, I hear, cost — they're the most expensive elevators in the history of the world."" — At a campaign rally on Monday in Cleveland Richard Cordray, the Democratic candidate for governor in Ohio, was the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until last year. The bureau has been repeatedly criticized for a pricey renovation of its headquarters since 2014, but Mr. Trump's cost estimate is overstated. He is also wrong that the government does not own the building, and it is implausible that it houses ""the most expensive elevators in the history of the world."" The Treasury Department announced the location of the consumer bureau's headquarters in February 2011, before it was in operation, and noted that ""major building renovations were needed to make more efficient use of the space and to update the building to meet current energy and environmental standards,"" according to a 2015 inspector general report. While the consumer bureau is indeed leasing the space, the building is owned by a different federal agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. About $145 million was obligated for renovations, though the inspector general reported at the time that the project could potentially cost about $207 million over all. The report said those ""costs appear reasonable."" A 2017 construction progress report obtained by The Daily Caller shows that $124 million had been spent at that point, when 80 percent of the construction had been completed. The bureau moved into the building late last year, and Ken Sweet, a journalist at The Associated Press, reported this year that the bureau's office costs topped $240 million. But that figure includes rent as well as the renovations, Mr. Sweet said in an email. While ""the cost ballooned under Cordray's watch,"" Mr. Sweet said, Mr. Trump's statement is ""exaggerated.""  As for the elevators, Mr. Trump gave a specific estimate at a previous campaign stop in Ohio: $50 million, which would be a substantial part of the total cost of the renovation. Neither the 2017 progress report nor the 2015 inspector general report mentions elevators, and it is unclear where Mr. Trump got the figure from. But for context, a 1,070-foot glass elevator in China cost $20 million and an elevator set inside an aquarium in Berlin cost $17.4 million, according to Architectural Digest. Other Claims Mr. Trump also repeated numerous claims The New York Times has previously fact-checked:  He falsely claimed Democrats want to ""take away your health care."" (Democrats have consistently supported efforts to expand health care coverage.)  He falsely claimed Democrats support ""open borders."" (Democrats support border security measures.) He accused Democrats of inviting ""caravan after caravan."" (There is no evidence that Democrats are behind the migrant caravan.) He misleadingly claimed ""we've already started"" to build his promised border wall. (Construction has not begun.) He falsely said ""Medicare for all"" proposals would ""obliterate Medicare for seniors."" (The proposals expand coverage and benefits.) He claimed illegal immigration costs the country over $100 billion a year. (The figure comes from an anti-immigration group that has been heavily criticized by other researchers for methodological flaws.) He claimed lawmakers were unable to pass the Veterans Choice program for ""44 years."" (He enacted a bill making changes to the program, which was created in 2014.) He falsely claimed terminally ill patients could not gain access to experimental drugs before he signed a ""Right to Try"" law. (A similar federal program has existed since the 1970s.) He misleadingly claimed to have saved $1.1 billion on the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. (This figure conflates the cost of a temporary location with the cost of building a new permanent embassy.) He falsely claimed to have passed the largest tax cuts in American history. (Several others were larger.) He claimed Republicans would always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. (Republican legislation and actions by the Trump administration have undermined those protections.) He claimed association health plans, which his administration approved in June, will be ""frankly better insurance"" than those offered under the Affordable Care Act. (The association plans do not have to offer coverage of ""essential health benefits"" like maternity care, mental health care and prescription drugs.)"
News,2018-11-06,The gig economy has created economic opportunities for millions of people. Uber and Lyft have empowered everyday drivers to become paid chauffeurs. Airbnb has made homeowners hoteliers. And TaskRabbit has opened new markets for handymen and other laborers.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/business/dealbook/gig-economy-equity-sec-rule-701-uber-airbnb.html,918," The gig economy has created economic opportunities for millions of people. Uber and Lyft have empowered everyday drivers to become paid chauffeurs. Airbnb has made homeowners hoteliers. And TaskRabbit has opened new markets for handymen and other laborers. But much of the wealth created by these companies is not passed along to workers through conventional wages, but to a small number of insiders who own stock. Uber is eyeing an initial public offering that would value the company at $120 billion. Airbnb was valued at $31 billion last year. Lyft was recently valued at $15 billion. TaskRabbit was bought by Ikea last year for an undisclosed amount. In each case, employees and investors reap the vast majority of those profits, while the gig economy workers — arguably the ones creating much of the value for these companies — can't partake in those winnings. That's because they are contractors, not regular employees, and federal securities law restricts private companies from issuing shares to such workers. That may soon change. Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission requested public comments on potential updates to the laws that govern who can receive stock in private companies. Among the possible modifications to the law — known as Rule 701 — is a change that could have far-reaching implications for how gig economy workers are compensated. In considering a change, the S.E.C. is tacitly acknowledging that for all the value gig economy companies are creating, they are also, in some ways, contributing to the stark income inequality that is roiling society. Though contractors provide much of the labor for these tech companies, the S.E.C. noted that gig economy workers were not traditional employees who enjoyed conventional benefits and wages. ""Individuals participating in these arrangements do not enter into traditional employment relationships, and thus may not be 'employees' eligible to receive securities,"" the S.E.C. wrote, going on to ask whether nonemployees should also be eligible to receive stock. Companies were supportive of the idea. Uber, Airbnb and Postmates, a food-delivery start-up, all chimed in, saying they would welcome the change. ""Providing equity would allow partners to share in the growth of the company, which could lead to enhanced earning and saving opportunities for the partner and for the generations ahead,"" Uber's head of federal affairs, Danielle Burr, said in a letter to the S.E.C. Rob Chesnut, Airbnb general counsel, echoed the sentiments in his comments to the S.E.C. ""As a sharing economy marketplace, Airbnb succeeds when these hosts succeed,"" he wrote. ""We believe that enabling private companies to grant hosts and other sharing economy participants equity in the company from an earlier stage would further align incentives between such companies and their sharing economy participants to the benefit of both."" And Postmates said it hoped it could grant equity to its contractors. ""While we are proud that our fleet earns significantly higher than minimum wage across jurisdictions, we are also committed to the long term upward mobility of our Postmates,"" company executives wrote, using company jargon for its gig workers. Even gig workers chimed in. ""Permitting Uber contractors to own stock in the firm would be another measure which would allow a large group of people on the lower economic rung of society to make significant strides toward the greater wealth and financial security enjoyed by the middle class,"" wrote Brian Sament, who identified himself as an ""UberEats delivery guy."" Yet even if gig economy workers did have access to equity, there is no guarantee that it would solve their financial woes. Though it's not clear if such equity grants would replace or reduce wages, labor experts say that relying on private company stock is risky, especially for workers lacking financial security. ""Equity is not wages, it's risky,"" said Louis Hyman, a professor at Cornell University and author of ""Temp,"" a recent book on the labor market. ""For people who need to have a steady paycheck, this is not the answer."" Should the S.E.C. move ahead with such a plan, there are plenty of details still to be sorted out, including the tax treatment of such equity grants. If gig economy workers receive private company stock without any way to sell it, they could be liable for taxes on those gains, without having any easy way to pay those taxes. The S.E.C. could also need to modify other rules that stipulate that if companies distribute stock to more than 2,000 people who are not employees, such as accredited investors, they need to adhere to more rigorous public reporting requirements. And in one of the rare instances when a company tried to do something similar, it failed spectacularly. Juno, an Uber competitor, offered its drivers restricted stock units that were supposed to convert into lucrative equity. But when Juno was sold to another company, Gett, last year, the program was scrapped, and the equity was virtually worthless. And even before that happened, Juno was considering whether its program might have to be voided because of scrutiny from the S.E.C. Despite the inherent risks in such an arrangement, it's a fair bet that most gig economy workers would jump at the chance to get even a sliver of equity in a company like Uber or Airbnb. ""It's said that 'the greatest social program is a job,'"" Mr. Sament wrote the S.E.C. ""But a job or contractor position with stock benefits would help hundreds of thousands of people to do more than just tread water financially. We may be able to achieve some measure of security."""
News,2018-11-06,How to create more diverse workplaces and how to use artificial intelligence ethically are among the more challenging dilemmas facing business and government.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/business/dealbook/the-commonality-of-ai-and-diversity.html,1457," How to create more diverse workplaces and how to use artificial intelligence ethically are among the more challenging dilemmas facing business and government. While the issues may appear to have little in common besides their complexity, they do overlap. Recently, for example, according to news reports Amazon abandoned a hiring tool that used artificial intelligence because it favored men. These topics were the subject of two separate task forces that met at last week's DealBook conference. Each task force, composed of about a dozen experts and industry leaders, met for an hour, emerging with some specific guidelines and focus areas that were shared with the conference and could be taken back to companies and other organizations for discussion. Companies must be aware of and recognize that algorithms are not neutral, but created by humans with biases and beliefs and make every effort to eliminate those biases.  It is far too easy to assume that technology has an objectivity that humans don't. But the reality is that ""artificial intelligence and machine learning and algorithms in general are designed by none other than us — people,"" said Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. ""A.I. takes input data and races off to make inference and decision making about the world at lightening pace,"" he said, and those inferences will include unacknowledged biases unless people are willing to recognize them and invest the time and money to weed them out. Frida Polli, co-founder and chief executive of Pymetrics, which uses A.I. to recruit employees for companies, showed how biases could arise and how they could be diminished. Algorithms used in A.I. are created using training data sets. If a training data has an overrepresentation of any gender or ethnicity, the features that distinguish that group may be overweighted. To confront the problem, she said her company tested an algorithm on a reference group of people of different genders and ethnicities to check for bias. If there's an imbalance in the test run — far more men, for example, or whites are predicted to be good hires rather than women or other races — then ""we can look at de-weighting features,"" she said, that alter the algorithm. Technology companies can and should help the government — and the military in particular — develop and use artificial intelligence, but it must be done thoughtfully and carefully.  One of the first issues to arise in the task force was Microsoft's decision announced last month to bid on a $10 billion cloud computing contract for the Pentagon. This was after Google dropped out of the bid and told the military it would not provide A.I. products to build more accurate drones or compete with China in creating weaponry. ""The debate is ongoing about when and how to share technology with the government and specifically should companies share digital technology with the military,"" said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of business development at Microsoft. Most of the task force agreed that partnerships between technology companies and government on A.I. could be beneficial, but Serkan Piantino, founder and chief executive of Spell, a company that builds tools for those building A.I. technology, said there should be limits. ""Automating the process to use lethal force is something I wouldn't be comfortable doing, given how little we know with what is going on with A.I. algorithms,"" he said. A.I. requires transparency within the companies building and using it and with the public.  Having company employees debate and speak out on potentially controversial issues involving A.I. — such as at Microsoft — is one form of transparency. Dennis Crowley, co-founder and executive chairman of Foursquare, said his company had internal discussions when making business decisions that might have ethical implications. ""Sometimes we have the opportunity to create more evil than good, and we need to talk about that,"" he said. One example, he said, was whether his company would work with fast-food chains that wanted to target those using cannabis dispensaries where it was legal. It hadn't been done before. ""This was right on the edge, so we went to the ethics committee,"" Mr. Crowley said. In the end, ""we decided to do the campaign. It was legal and clever and a good use of technology around a category where we don't see a lot of advertising."" Cordell Schachter, the chief technology officer for the New York City Transportation Department, noted that transparency would be crucial with those creating the city's future transportation technology, which would be driven by A.I. ""We want to see the data — and not cherry-picked data — before it goes on the streets,"" he said. Companies should set targets and goals, along with incentives, as a way to foster a more diverse staff, but they shouldn't be used in a vacuum.  ""Aspirational goals are important, but "" it's just not enough,"" said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer for Goldman Sachs. ""It's not enough to say you want to get the world or your company to 50-50 — there needs to be transparency around that."" That means what specifically is the goal, and what is the company doing to achieve that goal — ""both good and bad,"" she said. ""There is a growing body of evidence that suggests cognitive diversity contributes to better decision making at the board level,"" said Cyrus Taraporevala, president and chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. ""Studies show that diverse boards pay more attention to risk management and are less susceptible to cronyism and group think."" But there's a danger that goals become items to be checked rather than real change. Damien Hooper-Campbell, chief diversity officer at eBay, said that while setting goals and targets for diversity was important — and backing it up with real costs, such as bonus deductions, if the goals aren't met — you also have to ""meet a company where it is."" If a company has just begun to focus on diversifying its work force, it needs to be educated on how to do it over time, he said. ""People talk about how businesses measure widgets and productivity, so they can measure this, too. But there's a big difference between widgets and human beings."" Federal policies and legislation can play a role in promoting diversity in the workplace.  Developing laws and policy to create diversity is not always a popular idea, but some say they believe that there are areas where government can help. John Hope Bryant, founder and chairman of Operation HOPE, a community organization, said there was a need for a federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships. When the effort is aimed at women and people of color, ""you should get double credit for that double reach."" A federal policy to encourage paid family leave would also play a crucial role in promoting diversity, said Sallie Krawcheck, chief executive and co-founder of Ellevest, a digital financial adviser for women. Federal policy could also help ensure that the information companies report on the makeup of their work forces and the compensation are truly transparent. For example, in Britain, many public-, private- and voluntary-sector companies are required to disclose average pay for men and women, including bonuses. In the United States, said Lauren Taylor Wolfe, managing partner of Impactive Capital, ""a lot of companies decide what they disclose and what not to disclose. If it's not done by level, it's not real transparency."" To be truly diverse and inclusive, a company must change its culture — and that has to come from the top down.  ""You can have policy and tactics, but if the culture is not ready to receive it, it will be an organ reject,"" said Thasunda Duckett, the chief executive of consumer banking at JPMorgan Chase. Or as Ms. Taylor Wolfe noted, ""companies get what they celebrate, and if they celebrate diversity, they'll get it."" No one expects cultural change to happen quickly, but one of the important elements, Ms. Duckett said, is that bosses need to ""manage to the difference."" Don't manage everyone the same and expect the same results. After all, parents don't expect each child to be the same — they parent differently depending on a child's personality, strengths and weaknesses, she said. Managers have to do the same. She also noted that diversity was not the same as inclusion and companies must be aware of that. ""Diversity,"" she said, ""is being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance."" Finally, change may seem glacially slow, but Mr. Hooper-Campbell said people shouldn't be surprised. ""It wasn't but 100 years ago that I couldn't go to school with some of the people in this room."""

Because of the financial instability of this position, several of my colleagues and I also teach for a different school online, College B.  Throughout my time working for College B, I've been asked to rewrite and develop course content for its online curriculum, a great source of revenue. To develop this content, I have used my expertise from teaching previous classes, but I have always been careful to change the course so that the students have a unique experience; I believe it is my ethical obligation to create new content if I am being paid to do so. Also, the students we teach at both schools will essentially be one another's competition upon graduation, so it is important to me that each school show distinct projects. It has never been explicitly stated by either school, but I assume that they do not want me taking content I have developed from one college and selling it to another. Several weeks ago, I was grading final portfolios for the students in College B and noticed that their projects looked extremely similar to work I have seen from students in College A. When I looked, I saw that the professor for the class for College B was the same professor who teaches the course at College A. It appears that my colleague developed the curriculum for one college, and instead of developing something new, self-plagiarized and sold duplicate content. My colleague's employment at both colleges precedes mine, so I am not sure which college the colleague originally created the content for and which college received the plagiarized content. To me, there are several ethical issues here: First, self-plagiarism or plagiarism is grounds for expelling a student; I suspect this would also be true for teachers. Second, it is my understanding that what is created for one school belongs to the school, so this is copyright infringement. Third, tuition for each of the schools is different, but students are getting the same product at two different prices. Fourth, when they apply for jobs, students are competing with what they believe is a portfolio of unique projects, but they are not. When we homogenize the curriculum of education for this degree, we lose the diversity of thought that comes from new pedagogical experiences. Finally, online education in my industry is growing, and my colleague seems to be the first one in the door developing course content for all the schools; I suspect this will continue if the colleague is not stopped. What is my ethical obligation here? I have a good rapport with both of my bosses, but if I were to report my colleague, it would be obvious it was me. I have been paid in the past to fix and refine courses that this colleague developed for the online curriculum for College B, content that was also self-plagiarized and raises questions about quality too. If I were to report this colleague, I would potentially be securing additional employment for myself to rewrite the courses, which could be viewed as self-serving. What's a prof to do? Name Withheld It isn't easy to keep clear about issues of intellectual property, as your letter shows. Generally speaking, when teachers at one institution join the faculty of another, whether as a visitor or as a permanent member, they are free to use a curriculum that they have developed, unless the first institution has acquired copyright to it. One college hires a Milton scholar from another college, and the syllabus of the Milton seminar she has developed over the years comes with her. Nobody sees this as a problem. And given that there are some terrific and widely used textbooks, plenty of students study the same curriculum at different institutions. Indeed, the whole idea of self-plagiarism is distinctly unhelpful. Certainly, there can be issues of property and of contract here. If you create an intellectual product, it may be wrong to sell it to someone because you've already sold it to someone else or because you otherwise agreed not to do so — or simply because there's a settled expectation that you won't. (It's perhaps worth noting that this problem wouldn't have arisen if your colleague were afforded a position that was properly paid and that, in consequence, discouraged him from teaching elsewhere.) But scholars routinely rework their essays or lectures into books, and we call that process road-testing, not self-plagiarism. We shouldn't even speak of self-plagiarism when students submit the same work in different classes: The sin here doesn't involve intellectual theft; it involves dishonesty and sometimes laziness. But there's a set of serious questions that you're pointing to. As large-scale online education develops, with less and less interaction between students and teachers, the value of a course is going to depend mostly on the materials associated with it and the instructional tools that guide students through those materials. People developing materials for these courses will be selling them once, producing copyrighted material that will often belong to the course provider. Legal issues of defining what counts as breaching the copyright will naturally arise. In such a world, if two online courses created by the same person look very similar, valid legal complaints may arise. Still, it strikes me that the risk of intellectual homogenization here is easily overstated. This might be a concern if one professor or course truly dominated a field, which is unlikely, and even at art school, the same assignment is likely to produce widely different responses. And students might be better off using a great curriculum that is also used at a variety of other institutions than a lousy curriculum created just for them."

What started as a few unpleasant aches soon became debilitating pain throughout her body. A heavy fatigue settled into her bones: Holding scissors or sweeping the floor became too much. She slept fitfully; her memory flagged. Frustrated by many symptoms and few answers, she grew anxious and depressed. Our medical team, after a battery of unrevealing tests, settled on a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Tears welled in her eyes as I explained the diagnosis, and I worried I'd been too brusque. But these were tears of relief, she said, not because the symptoms had ceased, but because she finally had an answer, a name for her pain. Those who suffer without a clear understanding of its cause experience a unique form of torment. There is great power in diagnosis: It can be comforting, terrifying, and sometimes, even healing. There's evidence, for example, that patients who receive a new diagnosis of fibromyalgia — for which there is limited treatment — may have fewer symptoms, be more satisfied with their health, and possibly incur lower costs. But fibromyalgia wasn't a recognized diagnosis 30 years ago. Nor were many other now-common diagnoses that have only recently been recognized and treated as medical conditions. Since the 1980s, there's been rapid expansion in the number and complexity of medical diagnoses — a trend known as ""medicalization."" A recent study found that the cost of 12 newly medicalized conditions — things like irritable bowel syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, low testosterone, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — now approaches $80 billion a year, or about 4 percent of total health care spending. That's about as much as we spend on heart disease or cancer, and more than we spend on public health initiatives. Our ever-expanding armamentarium of diagnoses no doubt offers comfort, attention and a path to treatment for many previously undiagnosed — and undiagnosable — patients. But we may also be medicalizing much of normal human behavior — labeling the healthy as diseased, and exposing them to undue risk of stigma, testing and treatment. Trouble sleeping is now insomnia. Shyness is social phobia. Grief is depression. Infidelity is sex addiction. It's not that these diseases don't exist — the spectrum of human behavior is broad, and the extremes do represent real pathology — but we may be drawing lines in the wrong places, with negative health and financial consequences. A central problem is that medicalized diagnoses often come with medicalized treatments: Our penchant for pills outstrips even our desire for diagnosis. Since the 1990s, the number of office visits for sleep problems has doubled, and diagnoses of insomnia have increased sevenfold. But prescriptions for sleep medications have increased more than 30 times. This is perhaps most concerning for children. About 12 percent of children in America now carry a diagnosis of A.D.H.D, and there was a 40-fold increase in childhood bipolar disorder diagnoses between 1994 and 2003. Five times as many children are now prescribed psychostimulant and antipsychotic medications as were in the 1980s. Today, a quarter of children and teenagers take prescription drugs regularly, and seven percent of older adolescents and young adults report abusing opioids — most of whom were initially prescribed them by a doctor. With millions of Americans taking risky medications for questionable diagnoses, have we medicalized everyday life? There's no shortage of factors that have gotten us here. The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, has taken an active, sometimes dubious, role in defining and promoting new diagnoses, through direct-to-consumer advertising and physician outreach efforts. Often overlooked, however, are how the psychologies of doctors and patients contribute. Clinical encounters that don't end with a definitive diagnosis — a clear acknowledgment of the enemy — are inherently unsatisfying. Doctors, through their training and mandate, are motivated to package a constellation of symptoms into something that can be understood, named and treated. At the same time, we have both a growing arsenal of medications to fix patients' problems and a steadily shrinking number of minutes in which to do so. Not surprisingly, the path of least resistance becomes labeling and prescribing instead of exploring and managing. Patients are motivated by the understandable desire to name and ease their suffering — and today, many more patients have that opportunity. But it also means that much of normal human experience is treated with prescriptions instead of patience. This is perhaps not surprising. We increasingly have easy solutions at our fingertips: Dial-up modems have given way to broadband; stores are being replaced by Amazon drones; courtship is now Tinder. Is it wrong for patients to expect quick fixes from medicine? An important step forward may be putting more emphasis on nonprescription remedies. For many medicalized conditions, lifestyle changes are often just as effective as medications, if not more so (and don't come with side effects). Patients and doctors should also regularly revisit whether a given diagnosis still applies over time. Many patients diagnosed with depression, asthma, acid reflux or insomnia may not meet criteria for these conditions when reassessed, but they often continue taking medications even after symptoms have resolved. More fundamentally, we need to reconsider where the upper and lower bounds of diagnosis should be. Many experts believe the pendulum has swung too far, such that much of normal human behavior now falls within treatment thresholds. This reassessment is particularly important because those with mild or borderline symptoms may be less likely to benefit from treatment than those with more severe symptoms. Diagnosis is complicated. It can be a path to acceptance and treatment, or a road to risk and stigma. More diagnoses mean more patients can heal but also that more might suffer. Figuring out who will be helped — and who will harmed — might be the most important diagnosis we make. Dhruv Khullar, M.D., M.P.P.

News,2018-11-06,"[See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors’ races, and read our analysis.]",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/politics/patriotism-midterms-trump.html,1985," [See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors' races, and read our analysis.] DES MOINES — President Trump has spent his 21 months in office labeling his critics as unpatriotic. N.F.L. players who kneel during the national anthem possibly ""shouldn't be in the country,"" he has said. Journalists who write unflattering stories are ""enemies of the people."" Democratic lawmakers who did not clap for his State of the Union address were ""treasonous."" And yet, for Bridget Carberry Montgomery, a Democrat in Iowa, this is a time when she has never felt more patriotic. Ms. Montgomery, a 43-year-old mother of four, had never gotten involved in politics before this fall, when she led a group that met Sunday nights at a sports bar, with children in tow, to write postcards urging Iowans to turn out to vote. ""I love my country and I want it to be the very best version of itself,"" she said. She added, ""I feel emboldened in my patriotism."" As the nation goes to the polls in what is widely seen as a referendum on the president's conduct, policies and character, both his supporters and his opponents are expressing sharply contrasting views on issues like immigration, guns and the courts. But increasingly they differ on something more fundamental: what it means to be patriotic and how to express that politically. Here in the middle of the country, where three of Iowa's four House races are competitive, and where Mr. Trump first rewrote the rules of patriotism by attacking a war hero and ex-P.O.W., Senator John McCain, it is clear that Republicans and Democrats part ways over the meaning of duty, respect and love of country. For Republicans and Mr. Trump, who was joined for his final rallies by the singer Lee Greenwood, who performed his anthem ""God Bless the USA,"" patriotism in politics often means conspicuous displays of respect for the traditional expressions of America — the flag, the military, the Pledge of Allegiance. Denise Bubeck, a Republican in Grimes, Iowa, works for an advocacy group that promotes ""family values"" such as heterosexual marriage and opposition to abortion. For her, standing to show respect for the flag is nonnegotiable. When she sees athletes kneeling in protest of police brutality during the anthem, she thinks of a grandfather who was killed in the battle of Iwo Jima. ""People actually shed blood for the freedoms we have,"" she said. ""We need to show respect for this country."" But, particularly in this election season, many Democrats described their vote as a different form of patriotism, an urgent effort to protect and reclaim American democracy. That view tries to redefine a subject Democrats in the past have often ceded, politically, to Republicans. Democrats see a president who has sought to use the Justice Department against his political enemies, to undo constitutional protections including freedom of speech and birthright citizenship, and who has dangerous authoritarian tendencies. They are furious at the Republican majorities in Congress for not exercising their responsibility to hold Mr. Trump accountable. Democrats ""are rallying around a rhetoric of 'you've got to go out and do this to save the country' — that voting is going to be a patriotic act, that there are norms being violated and institutions corrupted,"" said Kevin M. Kruse, a historian at Princeton University. Some conservative intellectuals think Democrats' efforts to seize a patriotic mantle is fundamentally flawed. They argue that progressive politics is built on grievances about racism, sexism and other alleged sins of America. Support for President Trump can be explained in part as a patriotic backlash to the left's ongoing critique of America, said Shelby Steele, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. ""Trump is president today because the left got drunk on its sanctimony, on its moral superiority, and actually put down these people, and in many cases quite unfairly,"" Mr. Steele said. ""And so the explosive support for this guy from nowhere is those people who felt overlooked and excluded from this new vision of America, this new liberal innocence. They want to be — they believe — that they're really proud Americans, and their patriotism is built on American self-esteem."" A defining moment this campaign season was when Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic Senate candidate in Texas, responded to a question about N.F.L. players who kneel during the national anthem to protest police killings of blacks. ""I can think of nothing more American,"" Mr. O'Rourke said of the protests, in a speech that went viral. The next day, the president told supporters in West Virginia, ""You're proud of our country, you're proud of our history, and unlike the N.F.L., you always honor and cherish our great American flag."" Democrats and Republicans are divided over the acceptability of dissent as a component of patriotism. Kristen Anderson, a 34-year-old new mother who lives in Des Moines, sees protests very differently. She invoked the definition of patriotism written by James Baldwin: ""I love America more than any other country in the world and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually."" Ms. Anderson, who works for a financial company, said her vote for the Democratic challenger in a tight race in Iowa's Third Congressional District was a vote to flip the House majority, and put a check on the president. ""I think anyone who's paying any attention should be worried about democracy,"" she said. She said her own family was directly threatened. As a lesbian, she said the constitutional protection of her marriage felt vulnerable with Mr. Trump's Supreme Court picks. Her spouse, a Latina immigrant, has a green card. ""But with this administration's antagonism toward immigrants, especially those of Latino descent, and in a homosexual partnership — I can't trust this administration to honor precedents or laws,"" Ms. Anderson said. Like nearly everything in the Trump era, Americans' divisions over patriotism have become more partisan, polls suggest. Gallup, which since 2001 has asked people how proud they are as Americans, found this year that 74 percent of Republicans are extremely proud, but since Mr. Trump's election, the share of Democrats who are extremely proud to be American has plummeted to 32 percent. A YouGov survey this year found majorities of Democrats said a person can be patriotic who criticizes American leaders to foreigners, disobeys a law believed to be immoral or refuses to serve in a war believed unjust. Far fewer Republicans agreed that such dissents were compatible with patriotism. Brian Myers, a Republican small business owner in Madrid, Iowa, who did not vote for Mr. Trump (he wrote in Bobby Jindal, the former governor of Louisiana), said he was troubled by polls showing a drop in Democrats' pride in America. ""So often now I see people characterize the American flag as an offensive item,"" he said. ""'It's a symbol of racism and bigotry.' I just find that appalling."" Tyler Higgs, 32, a school psychologist who lives in Clive, Iowa, rejected the conservative critique that as a progressive he hates America. Mr. Higgs founded a local chapter of Indivisible, a grass-roots network on the left. ""Why are we knocking on doors, why are we going to legislative forums and writing letters to our legislators if we hate our country?"" he said. ""All these things they say are liberal outrage — that's patriotism."" Mr. Higgs called the midterms ""insanely important,"" listing ways he thought Mr. Trump was a threat to democracy: undermining the electoral process, attacking the independent press and ""stoking white supremacists in our society."" Many Republicans view this fear as overblown, even paranoid. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Iowa's senior Republican, said Democrats should relax, and that the Constitution's separation of powers remains intact. He recalled his first election to the House in 1974, shortly after Richard Nixon resigned, when there was wild talk about a military coup. But the Republic survived. ""As long as you've got the Constitution's checks and balances, what these Democrats are saying about the threat from Trump has no basis,"" Mr. Grassley said. Republicans for years owned the upper hand on patriotism as a political issue. The advantage dated at least to the Vietnam era, when some on the left equated the flag and the military with shameful symbols of American power. In the 1980s, Republicans mastered using the flag as a wedge issue in the culture wars. They later attacked President Barack Obama for going on what they called an ""apology tour"" of foreign countries and an insufficient embrace of ""American exceptionalism."" This year, however, with American prestige in the world suffering under Mr. Trump, Democrats have seen an opportunity and sought to rewrite the patriotism script. They nominated a slew of military veterans in Republican-held House districts. Many are women with tours of combat or the service academies on their résumés. The candidates include Amy McGrath in Kentucky, Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Elaine Luria in Virginia. Abigail Spanberger, running in Virginia, is a former C.I.A. antiterrorism officer. Jean Ludwig, 75, a retired financial adviser, has been knocking on doors for Republican candidates in Carroll, Iowa, including for Gov. Kim Reynolds and Representative Steve King. ""I wish there was more I could do,"" she said. In her view, a factual assessment of the Trump presidency would conclude that he has done an excellent job, but Democrats, who ""are more controlled by emotions,"" she said, have been unwilling to see it. ""They don't talk to anybody, just to each other: 'I hate the president, don't you?"" She said she particularly dislikes the news media telling her what to think rather than, in her view, reporting things straight. When Mr. Trump called himself a ""nationalist,"" much of the coverage was critical because of the historical association of the term with white supremacy; Ms. Ludwig called that media bias. ""Nationalism is a perfectly fine thing. It just means we're going to look out for the United States first,"" she said. Not far from Ms. Ludwig's home county, Emily Alberhasky hears something much more sinister in the president calling himself a nationalist. For her, it is the opposite of patriotism. ""He is giving voice and power to the racist underbelly of this country,"" said Ms. Alberhasky, 40, a mother of five from Ankeny, Iowa. ""When President Trump speaks about the caravan or any of the hundreds of thousands trying to get asylum or find safety in our country, and he speaks about them the way we have heard other groups, including Jews, be talked about in history, it gives me chills to the bone."" ""The association with the word nationalism is not one of democracy and acceptance,"" she said. ""It has a very heavy tone of judgment and supremacy to it."" She said the Trump administration has caused her fear and sleepless nights. ""Am I proud to be an American?"" she said. ""I don't think I can say I am right now. I feel really disappointed in close to half of this country. I feel embarrassed and ashamed that this is our current situation."" She added: ""But I'm really proud of more than half of our country and I feel very patriotic that I want this country to get back to, or maybe self-actualize up to, a place of being who we truly are, which is a very diverse, very eclectic, beautiful mix of all kinds of people."" Ms. Alberhasky had never been involved with politics before this year. She spent the days leading to Tuesday working 12-hour shifts in a campaign office, mobilizing volunteers to get out votes for Democrats. Dr. William J. Barber II, the North Carolina pastor and champion of liberal causes who lead protests known as Moral Mondays at the State Capitol, said the idea of eternally seeking to improve America is enshrined in some of the nation's most patriotic texts. He cited ""America, the Beautiful"" and its lyrics: ""America! America! God mend thine every flaw."""

I do not believe in other years I had intense conversations with neighbors about who was going to win the Indiana Senate race.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/opinion/midterms-elections-predictions.html,1781," Gail Collins: Bret, can you remember any other Election Day that was ever like this? With the whole nation so crazy nervous-excited about congressional races? I do not believe in other years I had intense conversations with neighbors about who was going to win the Indiana Senate race. Bret Stephens: The only thing that's remotely comparable in my memory, Gail, were the 1994 midterms, when Republicans regained control of the House after 40 years in the minority. One reason that election is worth mentioning is that it probably did more to strengthen Bill Clinton's presidency, after a chaotic first two years, than it did to weaken it. It gave Clinton a useful political foil in the person of Republican speaker Newt Gingrich, and it forced him to compromise on politically popular legislation, like welfare reform. My point, to those of us who want to ensure that Donald Trump is a one-term president, is to be careful what we wish for. Whatever happens on Tuesday isn't going to decide what happens in 2020. Or am I missing the forest for the trees here? Gail: Depends which forest you're meandering in. If, as most people presume, the Democrats take the House but Republicans keep the Senate, we'll see some interesting investigations into the president. I do sorta dream at night of seeing all those tax returns. But you're right that Trump will try to turn Nancy Pelosi into the new version of immigrant caravans. The Republicans have made her into their all-purpose target already, even when she hasn't actually had the power to do anything to thwart them. I don't think we've ever really talked about Pelosi. If you were the Democrats, would you replace her or would any new Democratic speaker become the same kind of whipping person? Bret: Pelosi personifies the Democratic Party a lot of people love to hate: wealthy coastal liberals who have been in office forever and cannot imagine why anyone who voted for Trump did so for reasons other than bigotry or imbecility. If she becomes speaker again, Democrats will be materially damaging their chances of defeating Trump in two years. Please, someone else, like Ohio's Tim Ryan or Massachusetts' Seth Moulton: Someone who can help win back the millions of voters who went for Barack Obama in 2008 and Trump eight years later. About those investigations: Yes, they might be very interesting. But I tend to doubt we'll learn anything from them that we won't eventually find out from Robert Mueller, and whatever he produces will have greater credibility for not being partisan. Also, investigating the past is probably not what's going to decide the election. Democrats need to put forward an agenda, work with the Trump administration on things like immigration reform and an infrastructure bill, and appeal to a wider cross-section of Americans. The question of Trump's tax returns is mostly a distraction from that goal. Gail: Yes, of course, you're right about the agenda. But the evil side of me really, really wants those tax returns. Bret: My evil side wants to outlaw New England sports franchises and zap people who walk too slowly on Manhattan sidewalks as they stare at their smartphones. Gail: On the Pelosi front, I do think the Democrats need new faces. But she deserves a little bit of a run first — I hate the idea of just caving into the Republicans' demonization of her. Have we discussed the way all of Trump's regular Democratic targets — except with the perfunctory nod to Chuck Schumer — are women? Does anybody think his tirades about Maxine Waters aren't playing to the Republicans' worst strain of racism and sexism? I just got a generic fund-raising letter from Eric Trump's wife, Lara. (No idea why I'm on her list, but it's always interesting to hear what the president's daughter-in-law has to say … ) The message was to send in one last contribution because ""we can't let Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters run the people's House."" Maxine Waters is ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, for God's sake. There are a dozen Democrats way more powerful and influential than she is. Bret: Speaking of singling out minorities, one of Trump's signature election themes — both in this cycle and the last — is the vilification of Latin American migrants. It's not enough for him and other Republicans to campaign on historically low unemployment and a big jump in annual wage growth. He needs a bugaboo, and the images of the migrant caravan play into his base's biggest phobias. Did I mention that last week was the 80th anniversary of Orson Welles's ""The War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast, featuring an imaginary Martian invasion? Gail: O.K., I really do like that ""War of the Worlds"" comparison. They're coming! They're coming! Bret: The question is whether it will work. I'm hoping it won't. But my guess is that elections in the United States have now become base plays where the key is to get your people to the polls rather than win over undecided voters. It also doesn't help that Democrats have barely made an effort to offer their own ideas about the caravan. Health care isn't the only issue in the world. Gail: There's also the importance of stopping the Republican agenda. There are only a few things they're actually capable of passing legislation on — maybe Kindness to Kittens Week, although I'm not even sure that one would get past our pet-phobic president. But one is taxes. Tax reform is fine but all the Republicans can do is cut, which means slashing revenue, adding to the deficit and increasing pressure on important social programs. I realize we are not entirely in accord on this matter. Bret: Tax cuts, I like. Deficits, I don't mind (as long as there is robust economic growth). But I like the Republic even more, and I'd hate to see Trump's first two years in office vindicated with wins in both houses of Congress. So I'm prepared to forgo additional tax cuts in the hope, probably vain, that Democrats will be strategic stewards in the House and not give in to the stupid temptation of seeking Trump's impeachment or getting lost in endless committee investigations about whether Trump misled the I.R.S. 20 or 30 years ago. I'd also love to see the emergence of Democratic presidential contenders who aren't the same people now auditioning for the role. Gail: Which includes … pretty much everybody. Are you hoping for a governor who hasn't raised his or her hand? A former cabinet member who's been working in the library on a new book for the last two years? Tom Hanks? Everybody likes Tom Hanks. Bret: Well, I can think of one former Hollywood actor who turned out to be a great president, so I'm not ruling it out. And as much as Ronald Reagan was hated by progressives, he did a lot to unite the country, which is what we could use now. The hideous anti-Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh, and the resistance of many Pittsburgh residents to Trump even showing up, is another reminder that Trump can't fulfill even the most basic presidential duty of consoling a wounded nation. We need a Democrat who can address the fact that the United States is in a moral recession even in the midst of an economic boom. Gail: We may be down to Tom Hanks. Bret: Or Michelle Obama. Gail: But seriously, I keep thinking about how we got to Trump, and how Trump got to Trump. He was a guy with virtually no political principles or governmental ideas when he started out. And early on, when you asked him why he was so obsessed with a wall, or why he had apparently changed his mind on abortion and gun control, the answer would invariably be that the crowd went crazy over that. He's a total creation of the yelling crowds. Sure, he gets huge audiences, because they know he's going to tell them exactly what they want to hear. And when they roar their approval, it reinforces his determination to do whatever they scream loudest about. I guess the big question is how much the people who come out to howl at his rallies reflect the people who come out to vote. Bret: There's a side of me that thinks that Trump is a natural culmination for a country that has spent the past 60 years besotted with television, the past 50 with moral relativism, the past 40 with ostentation, the past 30 with the politics of sex, and the past 20 with the politics of fear. He seems to encapsulate all of it. Gail: Don't forget the internet. And Fox. Bret: But I also think that it's a mistake to treat him as pure product of the crowd. For all the Democratic talk that the economy blossomed under Obama, there were pockets of the recession that never went away for the eight years of his presidency. It showed up in the large number of discouraged workers, especially those in late middle age, and probably in the opioid crisis. And Trump found a way to speak to that part of the United States in a way that Hillary Clinton never did. The Democrat who can win will be able to do the same. Gail: I agree, and hoping for a Democrat who can speak to all the parts of the country. Or at least most. Speaking of — um, it was elections, right? Any particular one candidate you're dying to see win/get creamed? Bret: It probably isn't going to happen, but I'd love to see the Democratic candidate in Tennessee, Phil Bredesen, pull off an upset in his Senate race against Marsha Blackburn. He represents the kind of centrism the party could really use. I also like Rhode Island's Gina Raimondo, a pragmatic Democratic governor, and I'm happy to see Charlie Baker, the Republican governor of Massachusetts, having no trouble with his re-election bid. You can probably see where I am here: I tend to like red state Democrats and blue state Republicans, people who by temperament and necessity have to learn to get along with the other side. I think I know what you're thinking: The country is in crisis, a G.O.P. victory in the House would consolidate a reign of bigotry and ruin — and this guy wants everyone to have a lollipop and be nicer to their neighbors. But after the last couple of years, I think that would be achievement enough. Gail: Totally in favor of the lollipop. Putting in a Hail Mary that somehow the evil racist Steve King loses his seat in Iowa. And that we have another two years of arguing about tax cuts without the danger there will really be any. Happy voting, Bret. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."

While trolls reportedly say that it's harder to operate on Twitter these days, a recent study by researchers at Oxford University showed that the social network now features 5 percent more false content than in 2016. And new research from the Tow Center for Digital Journalism claims that Facebook is still rife with falsehoods. In other words: You're still likely to see misinformation today. Here's what to look for, and what to do if you spot it. Opinion: Is it time for online voting? Big companies are helping employees get to the polls today. That's partly because they're eager to demonstrate their civic responsibility — but also because they have a stake in the outcome. The S&P 500 has risen 28 percent since President Trump took office, aided by last year's tax cuts and continued improvement in the economy. (Though the biggest winners and losers among stocks have little direct link to Trump administration policy.) But what happens if there is a big Democratic victory? Analysts appear split on the effect on the stock market. Elsewhere, the WSJ points out that other business matters stand to be affected: Infrastructure spending would most likely gain favor in Congress, while defense and agriculture could face more roadblocks. Perhaps more than ever, Beijing is interested in how Americans vote. A strong showing by Democrats would weaken President Trump — which could be a boon for China, whose economy is beginning to suffer from American tariffs. More on that from the scholar Anson Au in the South China Morning Post: If the Republicans lose their majority in both upper and lower chambers, gone will be the days where Trump does anything he wants. There'll be less room for chest-thumping bravado and more need for rational policy making and diplomacy. Trump would have to change his approach to adopt a more moderate tone: where before he could command, he would have to negotiate — with other countries, and within his own. Labor Department data shows hiring is getting harder. In August, there were 114 job openings for every 100 unemployed workers, the most lopsided ratio on record. Economists expect figures published today to show that the gap has widened. (Plus: Janet Yellen, the former Fed chairwoman, says full employment would help improve equality.) Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain puts pressure on her euroskeptic ministers. She is expected to warn critics in her party that time is running out to cut a deal with the E.U. So much for one HQ2. Amazon is nearing a decision to open two hubs, one in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens and the other in the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb. That's a last-minute change to a yearlong search for the location of the company's biggest office outside Seattle. More from Karen Weise and J. David Goodman of the NYT on Amazon's reasoning: Picking multiple sites would allow it to tap into two pools of talented labor and perhaps avoid being blamed for all of the housing and traffic woes of dominating a single area. It could also give the company greater leverage in negotiating tax incentives, experts said. ""Even if the most obvious reasons appear to be about attracting more tech workers, the P.R. and government incentives benefits could help, too,"" said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the online jobs site. Amazon already has large operations in both areas, which both have plenty of tech talent. But the decision would mean that neither city could really claim to have a campus equal to the one in Seattle, as Amazon originally promised. More Amazon news: Some employees reportedly hope to confront Jeff Bezos about the company's law-enforcement work on Thursday. High-level talks between Washington and Beijing are being rekindled. First, President Trump held a ""long and very good conversation"" on trade with President Xi Jinping of China last week. Now, Reuters reports, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will hold talks with senior Chinese officials in Washington later this week. The Chinese vice president, Wang Qishan, said today that China was ready for discussions ""on issues of mutual concern"" that could lead to a deal ""acceptable to both sides."" He added that ""China and the U.S. will both gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation,"" echoing recent comments from Mr. Xi. But a note of caution: Mr. Trump said on Monday that ""if we can make the right deal, a deal that's fair, we'll do that. Otherwise we won't do it."" He and Mr. Xi are expected to meet at the G-20 summit meeting in Argentina this month. After intense criticism about the way Facebook was used to incite violence in Myanmar, the company commissioned an independent investigation. The final report, written by the San Francisco-based nonprofit Business for Social Responsibility, says, ""Facebook has become a means for those seeking to spread hate and cause harm, and posts have been linked to offline violence."" In a blog post, Facebook's product policy manager, Alex Warofka, reflected on the findings: ""The report concludes that, prior to this year, we weren't doing enough to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence. We agree that we can and should do more."" When 13 American venture capitalists and tech executives visited China in August, they found a lot to like in the country's tech scene. Not least of which was crazy work hours, with one investor exclaiming, ""We're so lazy in the U.S.!"" But Li Yuan of the NYT notes that these Silicon Valley emissaries also found much to worry about: Chinese technology executives, they found, were even more driven and more willing to do whatever it takes to win. But that comes with major trade-offs, and punishing work schedules are only the beginning. They found Chinese tech executives to be less reflective about the social impact and potential misuse of their technologies, a potentially worrisome quality in a country with loosely enforced privacy laws, strict government censorship and a powerful domestic surveillance apparatus. More: The Starbucks C.E.O. says he'll bring the coffee chain's innovations in China to the U.S. Bloomberg Businessweek took a close look at Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and how he has become the most prominent holder of that office in decades. Normally, the Commerce Department is short on policy influence, but Mr. Ross has made himself a loud advocate of President Trump's nationalistic trade policies. The magazine explains how he assumed a very visible role: When he tapped Ross in late 2016 for the position, the president-elect called him ""a killer"" and promised Ross would be a key adviser in the crusade to throw over the chessboard when it comes to America's trade relationships. ""Wilbur's at all the meetings,"" says Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council. ""All the meetings. He's been a big player in the Trump administration."" Citigroup named John Dugan as its new chairman. It also named Philip Drury as its head of European investment banking. AMC Networks promoted Sarah Barnett to a new role overseeing cable channels like AMC, SundanceTV and IFC.

News,2018-11-06,"SEATTLE — One district had been a Republican heartland of freight-haulers and timber-workers before a shift toward suburbs and tech. Another was historically Democratic from the power of the railroad unions, then veered toward the Republicans. A third is liberal on its western side, conservative to the east, and locked in a battle over which side will prevail.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/washington-state-republican-house-flip.html,1353," SEATTLE — One district had been a Republican heartland of freight-haulers and timber-workers before a shift toward suburbs and tech. Another was historically Democratic from the power of the railroad unions, then veered toward the Republicans. A third is liberal on its western side, conservative to the east, and locked in a battle over which side will prevail. Three of Washington State's 10 congressional districts are in play in Tuesday's election — all considered competitive by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report — and so all three are potentially crucial to Republicans in holding their majority in the House of Representatives, and to Democrats in their hopes of taking back the House. Two seats are held by Republican incumbents, while the third is an open seat being vacated by a Republican. Washington State as a whole leans left these days, from the dominance in population of the Seattle area — both senators are Democrats, as are six of the 10 House members. But the state's three in-play districts do not fit that pattern, or really any pattern. All are starkly different from one another in economics, demographics, history and in the pitches that the candidates are making to voters. [Follow live results for the House of Representatives and the Senate.] Here is a look at three key races that could be pivotal on Tuesday — though the results may not be known until the wee hours of Wednesday or later, given that ballots in the state's vote-by-mail election can be postmarked as late as Election Day itself. Railroads and a perfect climate for soft white winter wheat have shaped the huge Fifth District that stretches across Washington's east side from Canada to Oregon. Once, in another political era, Representative Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat and the former speaker of the House, dominated the district, but most of the current century has belonged to Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers. Ms. Rodgers, a Republican first elected in 2004, is the highest-ranking female Republican in the House, as chair of the Republican Conference, which articulates policies for the majority, and has mostly batted away challengers in recent elections like pesky flies. But the district, anchored by Spokane, Washington's second largest city after Seattle, has also been changing, becoming more urban and more politically and ethnically diverse. Some rural corners of the district have struggled, with about one in eight residents living below the poverty line, and some counties, in losing young people, have become among the fastest aging in the state. The power of the railroad unions that once backed politicians like Mr. Foley faded long ago. In the all-party primary election in August, Ms. Rodgers was jolted by a surprisingly narrow victory — about 4 percentage points — over Lisa Brown, a Democratic former state legislator and economics professor. As the top two finishers, they will face one another again on Tuesday. President Trump carried the district by 13 percentage points in 2016, while losing Washington as a whole, but his divisive brand of politics has not been considered helpful to Ms. Rodgers, making her district part of a huge swath of the nation — the entire Pacific Coast, much of the Northeast and large interior cities like Chicago and Minneapolis — where Republican lawmakers do not want to be seen with him. Early voting patterns suggest that both sides are energized, said Ben Stuckart, the Spokane City Council president, who supports Ms. Brown. ""The more solid D's are turning out high and the more solid R's are turning out high, which kind of goes to the hardening of divisions,"" he said. There's a history in the district of tossing out veteran politicians in favor of new blood. Mr. Foley famously lost his seat in the House in 1994 — the first sitting House speaker to lose his district since the mid-1800s. But the dynamic is different this time because both women have long political records — Ms. Brown in the state legislature, Ms. Rodgers in Congress — that can be bragged about, or attacked by the other side. Scanning a map, the Eighth District looks like it could be one of those gerrymandered snake districts, winding around to find certain kinds of voters. But the reality is that by winding through central Washington, the district captures much of the demographic drama that rolls through the Pacific Northwest in general. It has affluent Democratic-leaning voters from the techie eastern suburbs of Seattle, union workers from Boeing around the company's huge airplane factory in Renton, and conservative farmers and retirees to the east, many of whom have left the bigger coastal cities. As a measure of its divisions, the Eighth has a higher percentage of foreign-born residents than the state as a whole, many of them agricultural workers in the fruit industry, but also more rich people, with a higher percentage of households earning more than $200,000 than the state as a whole, according to the census. Dino Rossi, a Republican who was almost elected governor in 2004 in one of the closest elections in state history (Christine Gregoire, a Democrat, won by 129 votes then beat Mr. Rossi again, more handily, in a rematch four years later) is facing Kim Schrier, a pediatrician and first-time candidate who has made health care her issue. They are competing to succeed Dave Reichert, a Republican, who is retiring. The district, historically Republican in Congress but won by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, is seen by both parties as the most likely of the state's three competitive seats to flip. But with the margin of victory expected to be tight whoever wins, voters have been pummeled by weeks of advertising in what has become one of the most expensive House races in the nation, with more than $26 million raised by candidates and outside groups. A voter-registration drive this fall on the campus of Central Washington University in Ellensburg, one of the district's biggest towns, might make a difference in a close race, said Ellensburg's mayor, Bruce Tabb. Or not. College students are inconsistent voters, at best. ""I've talked to students who seem to be more engaged,"" said Mr. Tabb, who has a nonpartisan office and has not endorsed either candidate. ""But it's a very, very challenging thing, I think, to actually determine what that impact is going to be."" A key thing to know about the Third District is that a significant chunk of it is actually part of the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area. While Portland is in another state, on the south bank of the Columbia River, and is famously liberal, the northern bank suburbs in the Third District, in and around Vancouver, Wash., in Clark County, are traditionally conservative. But Portland's little brother suburb has been growing up. ""Clark County is the housing pressure release valve for the tri-county Portland region,"" said Thomas Kimpel, a senior analyst at the Washington State Office of Financial Management, which prepares demographic and economic research. Vancouver was the fourth fastest growing city in the state over the last decade, partly from Portlanders crossing the river to find cheaper housing, or perhaps for the taxes. (Washington has no income tax.) The economy of the district has also moved away from its old base of timber, agriculture and shipping toward a more Portland-like economy of tech and services. Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler — a Republican and a protégée of Ms. Rodgers in the Fifth District, for whom she worked as a legislative aide before running for office herself — is facing Carolyn Long, an associate professor of politics, philosophy and public affairs at Washington State University Vancouver. Ms. Beutler only beat Ms. Long by about 7 percentage points in the August primary. The 2016 presidential election map provides another clue to the shifting dynamics in Washington State. All the counties won by Mrs. Clinton except two were clustered in the state's northwest corner, in Seattle and its neighboring counties. One of two Clinton outliers was Whitman County in Ms. Rodger's district — home to Washington State University. The other was Clark County, in Ms. Beutler's district."
News,2018-11-07,"In a week when Europe’s top soccer executives have hunkered down amid a wave of unprecedented leaks, the leader of Spain’s league took the opportunity to go on the attack.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/sports/soccer/la-liga-football-leaks-tebas.html,946," In a week when Europe's top soccer executives have hunkered down amid a wave of unprecedented leaks, the leader of Spain's league took the opportunity to go on the attack. Emboldened by recent leaks of documents that implicate Manchester City and Paris St.-Germain in possible attempts to obscure their spending and establish cozy relationships with soccer regulators, the La Liga president, Javier Tebas, said in an interview that the two clubs — and others that flout soccer financial rules — should face punishments that he says are long overdue. ""It was clear in the past that they were making dirty tricks; everything is crystal clear now,"" Tebas said of City and P.S.G., three days after the surfacing of leaked documents that appeared to confirm his long-held complaints the clubs had manipulated financial control measures. Still, Tebas said it was not clear either club would face sanctions, in part because of a tangled web of financial relationships that City, P.S.G. and European soccer's governing body, UEFA, have with financial powers in the Middle East. The royal family of the United Arab Emirates owns Manchester City, the reigning Premier League champion, and the sovereign wealth fund of the Qatari royal family owns both P.S.G. and beIN Sport, the network that has committed billions of dollars to televise the Champions League and other top competitions. That was why, Tebas said, UEFA has not acted to police violations. ""There's a conflict of interest,"" he said. Manchester City, P.S.G. and UEFA all declined requests for comment on Tebas's remarks. In other news reports, all three have described the recently leaked documents as malicious and have questioned their authenticity. European news organizations, led by Germany's Der Spiegel, began publishing a cache of internal documents Friday. The documents, the publication of which has rattled executives at the highest levels of the game, also detailed plans for a potential breakaway league featuring the sport's biggest teams — an effort that appears to be supported by Real Madrid's billionaire president, Florentino Pérez. Under one version of the so-called super league plan, more than a dozen of Europe's biggest teams would consider leaving their domestic competitions to play one another beginning in 2021. The clubs linked to the competition include two from La Liga (Real Madrid and Barcelona) but also Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Juventus — and Manchester City and P.S.G. Among the documents was a term sheet for a potential breakaway tournament produced by Key Capital Partners, the Madrid-based advisers to Real Madrid and Pérez's construction company, A.C.S. ""If these big European teams want to create a strategy to kill their own football fans, they can create a super league and they'll succeed in killing these fans within 10 years,"" Tebas said. Both P.S.G. and Manchester City have been sanctioned in the past over their spending, though UEFA has stopped short of handing down the harshest punishment — banning the teams from top competitions like the Champions League — though that fate has befallen other, less powerful institutions that breached the organization's Financial Fair Play rules. Other clubs have complained about what they see as unfair treatment. ""The FFP struggle is real for (some of us),"" the Italian team AS Roma tweeted in response to the leaks. UEFA is once again reviewing P.S.G's finances after its recent acquisitions of the Brazilian star Neymar and the French World Cup winner Kylian Mbappé; Neymar's purchase more than doubled the world transfer record, and Mbappé's move from Monaco made him the world's second-costliest player. P.S.G. is trying to block a new UEFA review of those deals through an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Tebas's charges of a conflict of interest were the most likely to drive a wedge between La Liga and beIN Sports, which owns the rights to Spanish soccer in multiple markets. But he dismissed any potential consequences for the league. ""If they're not willing to buy them we'll go somewhere else to sell them,"" Tebas said. ""The stability of professional football in Europe can't be bought by money."" UEFA's financial task force will hold its first meeting since the leaks on Wednesday. Tebas said he was planning to file a complaint with Europe's competition regulators if UEFA does not take action. But he may face questions of his own at home for his criticisms of Spain's domestic powers. The breakaway plan involving Europe's biggest clubs is something Pérez, the Real Madrid president, had been working on for years, Tebas added. Real didn't respond to a request for comment about Tebas's critique. Tebas and Real Madrid are locked in a separate battle over his plan to play an official league match in the United States, perhaps as early as this season. Tebas wants to use the match to raise the profile of the other teams in La Liga that are dwarfed by the popularity of Barcelona and Real Madrid. Barcelona is scheduled to play the first match against Girona on Jan. 26 in Miami, but players, unions, fans and — most important — the Spanish soccer federation all have objected to the idea. Without the federation's blessing, the game cannot be played. At a dinner last month, Tebas and Luis Rubiales, the Spanish federation's combative leader, failed to resolve the dispute. So Tebas said he was turning to the courts: La Liga plans to file a motion this week in Madrid to get the city's mercantile court to force the federation's hand. ""We think we have the right,"" Tebas said. Hours after he spoke on Monday, there was another leak, implicating more executives. ""They can hack me tomorrow if they want,"" he said. ""They won't find any dirty tricks in my emails."""
News,2018-11-07,"RICHMOND, Ky. — Representative Andy Barr, an incumbent Republican, defeated one of the Democratic Party’s most prominent challengers, Amy McGrath, on Tuesday in a deeply conservative district here, according to The Associated Press, giving his party hope of limiting losses in the race for control of the House.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/politics/andy-barr-amy-mcgrath-kentucky.html,753," RICHMOND, Ky. — Representative Andy Barr, an incumbent Republican, defeated one of the Democratic Party's most prominent challengers, Amy McGrath, on Tuesday in a deeply conservative district here, according to The Associated Press, giving his party hope of limiting losses in the race for control of the House. The contest took on national importance as a proxy for whether Democrats could win over white working class voters in rural areas and whether women would rise up against the barbed-wire rhetoric and harsh policies of the Trump presidency. It was among about 30 tossup districts, including many, like Mr. Barr's, where Republicans held a distinct partisan advantage. Public polling seesawed between a Republican lead and a Democratic lead, ending this week in an exact tie. Mr. Barr's victory on Tuesday signaled that Republican-controlled districts were still asserting their allegiance to the president, and may have been swayed by the issue of immigration and the Supreme Court nomination fight over Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. [See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors' races, and read our analysis.] See live U.S. House results and maps. Mr. Barr tethered himself closely to the president and to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, as he cast Ms. McGrath as an unreconstructed liberal in the mold of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who was for open borders and abortions as late as the ninth month of pregnancy. He was aided by millions of dollars of spending on attack ads against Ms. McGrath funded by the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC supported by Speaker Paul D. Ryan whose largest contributor is the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Ms. McGrath refused to respond with her own attack ads, instead choosing to mock Mr. Barr, often with the tagline, ""Is that all you got?"" Mr. Barr is well known in the district for attending all manner of local festivals and delivering on legislation that affects the area. But he found himself on the defensive over tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump that hurt the local bourbon and automotive industries along with soybean farmers. In the closing weeks of the campaign, he returned to themes that echoed the ones that Mr. Trump was emphasizing. The president had put his personal popularity on the line in the race, recently coming to campaign for Mr. Barr one day after former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. came to Owingsville, Ky., a rural part of the district, to support Ms. McGrath and to emphasize his party's need to reconnect with the white working class. In Ms. McGrath, whose biography as a Marine aviator gave her star power and a huge fund-raising advantage, Mr. Barr found himself running against a résumé that he could not match. So he emphasized his conservative ideology, and prevailed. [Make sense of the country's political landscape with our newsletter.] The district is anchored in Lexington, its most populous city by far and typically a Democratic stronghold, and the state capital of Frankfurt, another source of Democratic votes. But those cities are surrounded by mostly rural counties that are ardently conservative. In 2016, Mr. Trump won the district by 15 percentage points and Mr. Barr won by 22 points. Ms. McGrath's campaign opened campaign offices in all 19 counties, and she aggressively targeted rural areas, with yard signs tailored to individual counties, some even in Republican red, and by writing op-eds that her campaign placed in weekly newspapers. That strategy served her well in her primary campaign against Jim Gray, the popular mayor of Lexington, who was better known and had stronger financial backing. But she defeated Mr. Gray easily, and built on her strengths in rural areas during the fall campaign against Mr. Barr, pulling votes from people who were ancestral Democrats but vote for Republicans in federal office. [Follow our live briefing for the latest election updates.] Ms. McGrath started out underfinanced, but her campaign money fortunes changed drastically in August 2017 when she released a two-minute video online that captured her Marine combat experience, the struggles of women and her reasons for running for office. The ad generated millions of page views and contributions, enabling her to have rough parity with Mr. Gray, and then build on an emerging national profile. ""The video catapulted her to legitimacy,"" Mark Nickolas, Ms. McGrath's campaign manager, said. But it was not enough to overcome the power of Mr. Barr's incumbency, a district that was structurally advantageous to Republicans and the closing moves of the president to roust his political base and make the election a referendum on him."

The prize constitutes a cash award of $50,000. Shannon R. Stratton, the museum's chief curator, explained in a phone interview that the concept behind the prize is to show ""what craft might be in 2018 and beyond."" The financial element, she said, comes from a desire by the museum to support early-career artists who make up ""the changing face of what is perceived as craft in the United States."" The prize was endowed by Marian Burke, a trustee of the museum, and her husband, Russell Burke, and is to be awarded annually. It is aimed at artists under the age of 46 whose primary medium is glass, fiber, clay, metal or wood. Mr. Luger is a New Mexico-based artist who was raised on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. His work addresses environmental matters and issues of violence against indigenous populations, especially those who identify as female, queer or transgender. ""Cannupa Hanska Luger exemplifies craft as connected to the past as much as to the future,"" Namita Gupta Wiggers, a contemporary craft curator and one of the jurors who selected Mr. Luger, said in a statement. In addition to Ms. Wiggers, the jurors who selected Mr. Luger for the 2018 prize were Michael Radyk, the director of education for the American Craft Council and Jenni Sorkin, a professor of contemporary art history at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Next year, Mr. Luger will be on the jury, and each subsequent year's winner will be invited to return as a juror the year after they win. Some of Mr. Luger's work, along with work by other award finalists, is on display at the museum as part of the exhibition ""The Burke Prize 2018: The Future of Craft Part 2.""

News,2018-11-07,OTTAWA — A former cabinet minister and current member of Parliament was asked to leave the Conservative caucus on Wednesday after acknowledging he had sent sexually explicit photographs and a video to a woman over a three-week period.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/world/canada/tony-clement-resigns.html,663," OTTAWA — A former cabinet minister and current member of Parliament was asked to leave the Conservative caucus on Wednesday after acknowledging he had sent sexually explicit photographs and a video to a woman over a three-week period. Tony Clement, the ex-minister who twice ran for the leadership of the Conservatives, said in a statement on Tuesday night that he had believed the recipient was ""consenting."" But he said, without offering details, that he had ""been targeted for the purpose of financial extortion."" Shortly afterward, Mr. Clement resigned from several parliamentary posts, including a spot on a committee with access to national security intelligence. But on Wednesday afternoon, the leader of the Conservatives, Andrew Scheer, asked him to leave the caucus as well. ""I took him at his word that this was an isolated incident,"" Mr. Scheer told reporters. ""Since then, there have been numerous reports of other incidents, allegations."" Mr. Scheer did not offer any details about those reports. But several women posted messages on social media about online encounters with Mr. Clement that had left them uneasy. None mentioned receiving lewd images. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Scheer said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were investigating Mr. Clement's accusation of extortion. He said the national police force and the security section of the Privy Council Office, which runs the machinery of government, were also looking into the possibility of national security breaches. Mr. Clement, 57, had said on Tuesday night that he would retain his seat in Parliament, but he made no comment after he was removed from the caucus on Wednesday. ""I recognize now that I have gone down a wrong path and have exercised very poor judgment,"" Mr. Clement said in his statement on Tuesday. ""I apologize to my family for the needless pain and humiliation my actions have caused. I also apologize to my colleagues and my constituents for letting them down."" Mr. Clement said he would seek unspecified ""help and treatment"" and asked that his privacy be respected. The accusations against Mr. Clement could prove embarrassing to Mr. Scheer, a social conservative who has opposed same-sex marriage and abortion rights. Until Tuesday, Mr. Clement enjoyed a high profile as the Conservatives' spokesman on justice issues. But after his admission on Tuesday, concern focused on his role as a member of a relatively new committee that oversees the work of Canada's intelligence agencies as well as the intelligence operations of the mounted police. Made up of members of both the House of Commons and the Senate, the committee has wide access to the inner workings of those agencies as well as their most closely held secrets. Other members of the committee declined to comment to reporters on Wednesday, as did Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Compared with many Canadian politicians, Mr. Clement was an early adopter and avid user of social media, particularly Twitter and Instagram. Unusually, Mr. Clement has not posted any new tweets since Oct. 31. Mr. Clement, who is married to Lynne Golding, a prominent Toronto lawyer, first rose to prominence in a right-of-center Progressive Conservative government in Ontario in which he held several cabinet positions, including health minister. His initial bid to be elected to the federal House of Commons in suburban Toronto failed. In 2006, after moving to a district in a popular vacation area north of Toronto, Mr. Clement won his seat by a 28-vote margin. While the Conservatives were in power, Mr. Clement held four different cabinet posts, again including that of health minister. In 2010, while serving as industry minister, Mr. Clement misspoke to a group of people from the telecommunications industry, saying that Canada needed more ""sex stories,"" rather than success stories. That same year he came under criticism when millions of dollars in government money was spent in his electoral district in advance of a Group of 8 summit meeting. An Olympic-sized ice rink appeared, along with public washrooms, statues, gazebos and flower boxes, far from anywhere the world's leaders would visit."
News,2018-11-07,"Democrats wrested control of governorships from Republicans in seven states on Tuesday including Wisconsin, where they ousted Scott Walker after eight tumultuous years as the state’s chief executive, and Kansas, a surprise victory in a longtime Republican stronghold.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/politics/governors-midterms-florida-kansas-kobach.html,1653," Democrats wrested control of governorships from Republicans in seven states on Tuesday including Wisconsin, where they ousted Scott Walker after eight tumultuous years as the state's chief executive, and Kansas, a surprise victory in a longtime Republican stronghold. But Republicans fended off strong Democratic challenges to hold on to the governorships of Florida, Ohio and Iowa, maintaining their control of three states likely to be crucial in the 2020 presidential elections. The victories expanded the number of states with Democratic chief executives — an important consideration as legislatures begin the process of drawing congressional district lines. In addition to Kansas and Wisconsin, Democrats also picked up governor's seats in Nevada, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico and Maine. Still, the results reflected a night of mixed tidings for the party out of power, given that Democrats were hoping to install a rising young star in Florida and sweep the midwest states where President Trump forged the core of his unexpected victory two years ago. [See the results for the elections for governor nationwide.] The victory in Florida by Ron DeSantis, a Republican supporter of President Trump, turned back the historic effort by Andrew Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor, who was seeking to become the first African-American governor of his state. Republicans took another important battleground state with a victory in Ohio by Mike DeWine, the attorney general, who defeated Richard Cordray, a Democrat and former federal regulator. And in Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, defeated Fred Hubbell, a Democrat and wealthy businessman, in a tossup contest that had hinged on local issues including the state's health care system and its economy. The biggest defeat for Republicans was in Wisconsin. Mr. Walker, a onetime rising party star and short-lived presidential candidate, was seeking a third term in a state that unexpectedly flipped to Mr. Trump in 2016. The showing gave hope to Democrats eager to win the state back in 2020. Mr. Walker fell to Tony Evers, a Democrat and the state schools superintendent. As in other Midwestern states, Democrats ran against Mr. Walker and the Republican establishment rather than against Mr. Trump. [Make sense of the country's political landscape with our newsletter.] The loss in Kansas by Kris Kobach, a deeply conservative secretary of state and also a staunch ally of Mr. Trump, was also a big setback for the party in one of the most conservative regions in the country. He was beaten by Laura Kelly, a Democratic member of the Kansas Senate. In Nevada Steve Silosak, a Democratic businessman, defeated Adam Laxalt, the Republican attorney general, a victory that underlined the extent to which the state has been edging into the Democratic column — Hillary Clinton defeated Mr. Trump there in 2016, and Jacky Rosen, a Democrat, unseated an incumbent Republican senator, Dean Heller, on Tuesday night. It also reflects what analysts view as the rising power of Latino voters in the state. Mr. Trump notably did not campaign in Nevada during the final weeks leading to the vote, a time when he was stressing what he described as the threat of illegal immigration Democrats also captured Republican-held gubernatorial seats in two key Midwestern states, Illinois and Michigan. J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune, defeated Bruce Rauner, who has been governor of Illinois since 2015, and Gretchen Whitmer, a former member of the Michigan state legislature, defeated Bill Schuette, the Republican attorney general who also ran with the support of Mr. Trump. In Colorado, Jared Polis, a Democratic member of Congress, became the first openly gay man elected governor, defeating Walker Stapleton, a Republican and the state treasurer. Christine Hallquist of Vermont failed in her bid to become the first transgender governor in the nation, as Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, handily turned back her challenge and captured a second term as the state's chief executive. And in California, Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor, easily won election over John Cox, a Republican businessman, inheriting the mantle of Gov. Jerry Brown as the leader of arguably the most Democratic state in the country. Mr. Newsom loped to an easy victory, riding the overwhelmingly Democratic edge in the state but also the strong opposition to Mr. Trump. The president endorsed Mr. Cox in the primary. The contests for governor were, to a considerable extent, overshadowed by the battle for control of Congress during this contentious election season. But along with the battle to control state legislatures, they could prove significant in setting the nation's political landscape for the next decade. This new class of governors will take office as states prepare for the highly partisan process of drawing congressional and legislative districts. Republicans seized power in states across the nation in 2010, in the first midterm election of the presidency of Barack Obama, which put them in a position to use the redistricting process to cement their majority in Congress. The battle between Mr. Gillum and Mr. DeSantis was one of the most closely watched, in part because of the racial overtones that marked the campaign. Mr. DeSantis, who is white, squeaked out a victory after spending weeks addressing questions about his past political associations with racists and xenophobes. Mr. Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor, whose administration was under federal investigation for corruption, was repeatedly accused by Mr. DeSantis of financial impropriety. Mr. Trump was an early supporter of Mr. DeSantis, who defended the president on television and modeled his candidacy after the president's. And Mr. Trump returned the favor, heading to Florida to campaign on his behalf. Heading into Tuesday's election, Republicans controlled 33 governor seats, compared with 16 held by Democrats. (One is an independent). There were 26 Republican-held seats on the ballot Tuesday and nine Democratic seats. One of the most closely watched races in the nation was unresolved early in the morning. In Georgia, Brian Kemp, the Republican secretary of state, held a slight lead over Stacey Abrams, who was trying to become the first African-American woman elected governor in any state. Addressing supporters early Wednesday, she said she wanted all ballots counted and suggested the campaign may go to a runoff. In Kansas, Mr. Kobach is best known for his hard-line views on immigration and voting rights, and his candidacy was considered problematic by both national and state party leaders, who worried that he was too extreme to win a general election. Nevertheless, he was a close ally of Mr. Trump, and the president endorsed him in the days before the primary last summer. ""Today, Kansans voted for change,"" Ms. Kelly said as she declared victory in Topeka. ""Change not only in the direction of our state, but a change in the tone of our state."" In addition to Ms. Whitmer, another up-and-coming Democratic moderate, Gina Raimondo, held on to her governor's seat in Rhode Island, beating her Republican challenger, Allan Fung. Voters in New Mexico elected the state's first Democratic Latina governor, Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump's immigration policies. She defeated Representative Steve Pearce, a member of the Republican House Freedom Caucus. Democrats have not held the statehouse in New Mexico since 2010. Democrats also held on to several governorships in several states where they were heavily favored — Andrew Cuomo in New York, Tom Wolf in Pennsylvania and Tim Walz in Minnesota. Republicans kept seats in solidly red states including Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas, Arizona, Nebraska, South Carolina and Wyoming. Three moderate G.O.P. governors, Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, Larry Hogan in Maryland and Mr. Scott in Vermont, also kept their seats. Ms. Whitmer and Ms. Raimondo represent a class of younger — and energetic — Democratic leaders who, with this election, have emerged at a time when the party is debating not only what its ideology should be, but which lawmakers should lead it. Ms. Whitmer will replace Rick Snyder, a Republican who was elected governor of Michigan in 2010. A former venture-capital executive who won her first term for governor in 2014, Ms. Raimondo has been criticized for not doing enough to combat Rhode Island's lackluster economy. She has also faced lingering bitterness from some of the state's unions over her role in overhauling the pension system years ago when she was the treasurer. But on the national stage, she is well respected by high-ranking Democrats — she was among those reportedly considered as a possible running mate to Hillary Clinton — and serves as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association, which focuses on electing state executives. Mr. Cordray's loss in Ohio deepened the Democratic Party's concerns that the once-purple state has become irreversibly red. The Democratic Party had bet that a focus on lunch-pail issues could appeal to liberals and minority voters, as well the white working-class voters who had overwhelmingly swung to Mr. Trump. But Mr. DeWine's victory — driven perhaps by the popularity of the departing Republican governor, John Kasich — and the appearance of Mr. Trump at a rally in Cleveland on Monday, suggests that the reddening seen in 2016 could be more a new standard than an anomaly. Mr. Cordray was gracious as he addressed subdued supporters at a hotel in downtown Columbus. He congratulated Mr. DeWine and expressed hope that the governor-elect would bring the state together after a campaign that had at times turned sour. ""Mike has always been a dedicated public servant,"" Mr. Cordray said, ""and I hope he will be a governor who looks out for all Ohioans — as much for the Ohioans who voted for me as for the Ohioans who voted for him."" In Tennessee, where most of the political energy was focused on the state's Senate race, Bill Lee, a Republican, defeated Karl Dean, a Democratic former mayor of Nashville, in the race to succeed Gov. Bill Haslam. Mr. Haslam, a Republican who faced term limits and chose not to run for the Senate seat, was seen as a moderating force in the Tennessee capital."
News,2018-11-07,"It’s been years in the making, if not decades: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democratic Party seized complete control of the New York State government on Tuesday, decisively evicting Republicans from running the State Senate, which they have controlled for all but three years since World War II.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/nyregion/democrats-ny-albany-cuomo-senate.html,1283," It's been years in the making, if not decades: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democratic Party seized complete control of the New York State government on Tuesday, decisively evicting Republicans from running the State Senate, which they have controlled for all but three years since World War II. Now Democrats have to figure out just what to do with that newfound power — and almost everyone has different ideas and priorities, some of which had already started to collide on Wednesday, even as Mr. Cuomo and his Democratic colleagues celebrated major wins. Democrats now hold 40 seats in the State Senate, as Republicans lost eight to the Democrats on Election Day. That count, however, includes Senator Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, who has previously caucused with Republicans. Mr. Cuomo, meanwhile, won with 59 percent of the vote — some 3.4 million people chose him for a third term — a marked improvement from his 2014 victory, and one that left the governor sounding deeply satisfied. When asked on Wednesday what he would like to see passed in the coming legislative session, the governor laid out a veritable Christmas list of progressive baubles, including codifying Roe v. Wade's protections in state law; more gun control and ethics laws; the Dream Act, which would allow for financial aid for undocumented students; and the Child Victims Act, which would extend the statute of limitations for survivors of certain kinds of sexual abuse. Perhaps most notably, Mr. Cuomo said he would close the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which allows almost unlimited amounts of cash to flow to campaigns — including his own — through multiple limited liability companies. Mr. Cuomo had worked closely with Republicans and a breakaway group of Democrats during his seven-plus years in office, much to the chagrin of more left-leaning members of his party, who blamed those relationships for bottling up the very legislation he now wants to pass. And in describing his feelings on Wednesday, the governor sounded relieved that he would stop being blamed. ""My great frustration has been the inability to pass progressive measures that would have made a significant positive difference for the state and, as governor, bearing the burden of the failure of their passage,"" Mr. Cuomo said in an interview on Wednesday. ""The Democratic Senate will liberate me from that frustration."" Still there will most be a push for even more: There is already chatter about legalizing recreational marijuana; investing more in the crumbling subways; addressing climate change; and installing an early voting system for the first time, all ideas that the governor has previously offered differing degrees of support for. And after a tumultuous primary season in which liberal challengers ousted seven more moderate Democratic state senators, the virtual Holy Grail of current progressive thought seems within reach: a state-run universal health care system. Mr. Cuomo stopped short of fully embracing the proposal, saying it ""has merit."" Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who is slated to become the first woman and first female African-American to lead the New York State Senate, also struck a note of caution about the Democratic agenda. ""You eat the elephant one issue at a time,"" she said on Tuesday, as votes began to roll in for her party. There also will likely be, of course, intraparty differences. The Senate that Ms. Stewart-Cousins will lead is very likely to contain several factions, including New York City liberals and more moderate members from the city's suburbs. Fifteen of her members will be new to Albany, and its vagaries, with many of that cohort never before having held public office — or, in some cases, even having an office. [What drove the rogue group of Senate Democrats to work with Republicans? Read more here.] Gustavo Rivera, a Democratic state senator from the Bronx, said that Democrats had failed to keep the trust of voters during their brief time in charge nearly a decade ago and know they must do better this time. ""Governing is a very complicated matter,"" Mr. Rivera said. ""It's not just giving raises to your staff and getting nicer offices."" For many, the scars from that brief 2009-10 period of Democratic rule are still fresh. It was a tumultuous time marked by ugly legislative high jinks, warring factions and, the former Democratic leader eventually getting sent to prison. Mr. Cuomo won in 2010, in part, on a promise to restore sanity and stability to the statehouse. And he did so by occupying the political center between a liberal State Assembly and a Republican-controlled State Senate. For years, he has blamed any number of stalled liberal goals on recalcitrant Republicans. That catchall excuse dissolved Tuesday evening. Alessandra Biaggi, who defeated Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of the breakaway Democrats, said of Mr. Cuomo, ""Now it's up to us to actually hold him accountable and to make sure that the things that he says are not just campaign promises."" Much of the to-do list that Mr. Cuomo discussed after the election involved social or legal changes. But the governor has generally been more leery of raising taxes and other measures that would negatively affect the business community; real estate interests pour millions of dollars into his campaigns and drive a large segment of the city's and state's economy. Mayor Bill de Blasio has repeatedly called for a new millionaire's tax to fund various programs; Mr. Cuomo has steadfastly opposed it. The last time Democrats controlled the full Legislature, they raised taxes only to see themselves lose back the Senate within two years. ""This scary narrative about tax-and-spend-Democrats will not pertain to us,"" said Ms. Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester Democrat. ""It does not pertain to us."" One big issue sure to come up in 2019 is expanding rent control, as the current rules are set to expire. State Senator Brian P. Kavanagh, a Democrat from Manhattan elected in 2017, predicted ""a fundamentally different debate about the relationship between landlords and tenants"" than in the past. The governor has also signaled he wants to push a congestion-pricing plan to boost funding for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway system. ""How are we going to fix the M.T.A.? We have got to do this,"" Ms. Biaggi said. ""This is insane. Enough now. I don't think anyone wants to hear any more excuses."" Mr. Cuomo has previously feuded with state Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, who runs the political operation of Senate Democrats. Even some of the governor's allies were perplexed by an October news release from the state party, which Mr. Cuomo controls, that contrasted his efforts with those of Mr. Gianaris. ""Fund-raising Effort Follows News That D.S.C.C. is Losing Money Race,"" the release blared. (Mr. Gianaris runs the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.) Ms. Stewart-Cousins said, ""I thought that was an unfortunate press release, frankly, and I made sure that the state party chair was aware of that."" And on Wednesday, there were hints of friction there again as Mr. Gianaris said he had been kept in the dark about a possible deal to place a satellite headquarters of Amazon in Long Island City, which is the heart of his district. Mr. Cuomo has openly lobbied for Amazon to come to New York, joking he would even change his name to ""Amazon Cuomo"" to land the company. Mr. Gianaris, however, has expressed deep concerns about infrastructure, overcrowding and the wisdom of using subsidies to lure ""one of the richest companies in the world."" ""There's all sorts of red flags,"" he said. ""And I don't have any answers."" Still, Mr. Gianaris, who helped orchestrate the Democrats' big night on Tuesday, also seemed eager to keep the peace. ""This is a not a complaint that I wasn't briefed properly,"" he said."

Sign up here. Democrats have reclaimed the House, while Republicans extended control in the Senate. That spells gridlock — and investors are fine with it. As Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer of Cresset Wealth Advisors, told CNBC, ""History has shown that the mixed party control is generally the best combination."" U.S. market futures were up slightly this morning, as were international stock indexes. The dollar declined, partly on the diminished prospect of further economic stimulus like another tax cut. Michael McKenzie of the FT says that the trend could continue, as ""the election result seems likely to produce a softer dollar and steady bond yields, which will help"" the markets. Now, investors will turn their attention to other issues, including the Fed's monetary policy and the U.S.-China trade battle. Now that Democrats control the House, they will start trying to curb President Trump's agenda. Less clear is what they can achieve. First on the agenda is likely to be an array of investigations. Politico notes that Democratic lawmakers already have a list of subpoenas and document requests. Other officials, like New York State's new attorney general, have pledged to investigate Mr. Trump's business dealings and, potentially, his tax returns. House Democrats will also have more power to stymie Mr. Trump. Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, is expected to retake the speakership, while outspoken critics of the administration like Representative Maxine Waters, a skeptic of banking deregulation, are set to assume control of major committees. But there are limits. Democrats cannot force an end to Mr. Trump's trade fight with China, nor can they block judicial nominees. And Ms. Pelosi is unlikely to pursue impeachment proceedings. They are likely to work with the president on infrastructure spending and lower drug prices. ""Everybody understands that we have to choose our battles very carefully now,"" Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, told the NYT. So far, Quartz noted, the elections have led to: • More than 100 women in the House • The first Muslim women in Congress • The first Native American women in Congress • The youngest women in Congress • The first openly gay person elected as governor But Bloomberg argues that such records are important only if the new officials can stay long enough to effect real change. For now, election officials and social media companies are breathing a sigh of relief. At a news conference yesterday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said there was ""no indication of compromise to our nation's election infrastructure that would prevent voting, change vote counts or distrust the ability to tally votes."" Facebook said that it had shut down more accounts that it believed were spreading misinformation. It also said it had acted against some inaccurate voting information. (Accounts shut down on Monday are said to have been linked to a Kremlin-backed group of internet trolls.) But in general, the day bore no huge drama: ""We haven't seen anything unexpected,"" a Facebook representative told the BBC. But reports of meddling could yet come to light. ""I remain convinced that the real action will be after the election when we start to see the voter fraud, hacking claims start to roll in,"" Bret Schafer of the Alliance for Securing Democracy told the BBC. More: How Amazon might make a push into securing elections. The nation had been waiting to see if the midterm elections would dramatically weaken President Trump and help ease geopolitical tensions. But Democratic control of the House looks to give Beijing only a marginal increase in negotiating leverage. The results are unlikely to soften the U.S.-China trade war. Speaking at Bloomberg's New Economy Forum in Singapore this week, Gary Cohn, President Trump's former economic adviser, said: ""I wish that I could sit here and say, 'After the midterm elections, the White House and the administration understand they've got to solve trade issues.'"" But, he added, ""I don't think there's an instant cure."" China and Australia talk trade. Marise Payne is the first Australian foreign minister to visit Beijing in almost three years. She is to meet with her counterpart, Wang Yi, and plans to focus the conversation on trade and human rights. Financial markets are closed in India until Friday. The country is celebrating the Diwali holiday. The company's plan to split its second headquarters between two sites drew complaints that it acted in bad faith. But Amazon probably won't mind. John Gapper of the FT says that Amazon's tactic of looking at smaller cities was ""an elaborate charade."" And Robert Engel of the Free and Fair Markets Initiative, a frequent critic of the company, told the NYT, ""They've duped all of us."" The quest has gotten Amazon both lots of publicity and the offer of some fantastic financial benefits. But it may have gained something even more valuable, as David Streitfeld of the NYT notes: ""It's tempting to roll your eyes at this soap opera, but Amazon will walk away from this stunt with a cache of incredibly valuable data,"" said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a frequent Amazon critic. ""It's learned all kinds of things from the bidding cities — like their future infrastructure plans — that even their citizens are not privy to.""

Reflecting on last week's DealBook conference, Andrew explains that executives have long liked to talk about their role in society, but all too often their promises rang hollow. Now, things seem to be changing: As our society appears more polarized than ever, and as Washington seems in no hurry to heal this divided country, executives are finding themselves in the unwanted position of trying to play the role of uniter — or in some cases, picking sides. Also from the conference: Business leaders describe the breakthrough moments in their careers. U.S. crude prices fell 19 percent in October, after hitting a four-year high of $76 a barrel earlier in the month. Any further drop could end the biggest oil-market bull run since 2008. Here's more from Stephanie Yang and Amrith Ramkumar of the WSJ: The market started losing steam last month as falling U.S. stocks dragged down oil prices and raised doubts over the health of the global economy. Meanwhile, the world's three largest oil producers have increased output to record levels. ""All of this is combining to create way too much supply,"" said Gary Ross, chief executive of Black Gold Investors and founder of PIRA Energy Group. With supply expected to be plentiful, there's little reason to believe prices will rise again soon. That may be bad news for producers, but it's a relief to consumers and airlines.

News,2018-11-07,"WASHINGTON — President Trump threatened on Wednesday to adopt a “warlike posture” against Democrats if they use their newly won control of the House to investigate his financial and political dealings, drawing a line at the start of a new era of divided government.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/trump-midterms-house-senate.html,1719," WASHINGTON — President Trump threatened on Wednesday to adopt a ""warlike posture"" against Democrats if they use their newly won control of the House to investigate his financial and political dealings, drawing a line at the start of a new era of divided government. The president began a postelection news conference with an offer to work across party lines, but his conciliatory tone quickly turned contentious. And barely an hour later, he announced the firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions in defiance of Democrats who saw an effort to impede the Russia investigation. House Democrats also made the traditional nod to bipartisanship after their victory in Tuesday's midterm elections even as they emphasized that they would scrutinize everything from Mr. Trump's taxes to his campaign's ties to Russia in 2016. But after Mr. Sessions was fired, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said the decision would be investigated once Democrats took over in January. [Read the latest on Jeff Sessions's resignation.] The instant exchange of fire indicated that there may be no lull in the conflict that has cleaved Washington during the Trump era, and if anything, it may escalate beyond what the last two years have brought. Once in control of all the levers of power in the capital, the president and his party now face the prospect of an opposition House armed with subpoena power and stocked by Democrats who won office on the promise of imposing a check on him. Any talk of lowering the temperature after a harsh campaign seemed to dissipate as the president angrily scolded reporters whose questions or behavior he did not like. By the end of the day, the White House suspended the credentials of Jim Acosta of CNN, a move that other presidents did not take even during times of great tension with the news media. Democrats picked up at least 27 seats in the House on Tuesday, with 17 still undecided, and claimed seven additional governorships in places like Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas, states that Mr. Trump won two years ago and will be crucial to his chances of re-election in 2020. But he claimed a ""great victory"" because Republicans held on to the Senate and even knocked off Democratic incumbents in Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri, while losing only one of their own seats in Nevada. If they hold on to their current leads, Republicans will increase their majority to 54 seats from 51, giving them more maneuvering room as they confirm judges and other appointments by Mr. Trump. Although the balance of power in Congress was no longer in doubt, some key contests remained in flux. In Florida, Senator Bill Nelson, the Democrat, trailing by more than 30,000 votes, called for a recount, an idea dismissed as ""sad"" by his Republican opponent, Gov. Rick Scott. In Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat, trailed Martha McSally, the Republican, by more than 15,000 votes in a race. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams, a Democrat who is trying to become the nation's first black female governor, had not conceded her race against Brian Kemp, the Republican, in a race shadowed by concerns over voter suppression. Democrats did find good news in Montana, where Senator Jon Tester narrowly won re-election against Matt Rosendale, the Republican challenger backed by Mr. Trump in repeated rallies late in the campaign. At his news conference, Mr. Trump seemed to be trying to adjust to the new reality in Washington. ""I would like to see bipartisanship. I'd like to see unity,"" he said. But he said he would not tolerate investigations and would use allies in the Senate to open inquiries against Democrats in response: ""If that happens, then we're going to do the same thing, and government comes to a halt. And I would blame them."" Mr. Trump was the fourth president in a row to endure a major midterm election defeat. Mr. Trump's tone, however, was strikingly different from that of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who all expressed degrees of humility after major midterm losses in 1994, 2006 and 2010. Mr. Bush called his setback a ""thumping,"" and Mr. Obama described his as a ""shellacking,"" but Mr. Trump maintained that he had nothing to regret. He lost fewer seats in the House than Mr. Obama did and unlike his predecessor picked up Senate seats, he noted. The lesson he said he took from the election was validation. ""I think people like me,"" the president said. ""I think people like the job I'm doing, frankly."" The candidates he helped ended up winning, he said, and those who lost went down because they distanced themselves from him. ""Mia Love gave me no love,"" Mr. Trump said of a Republican congresswoman from Utah. ""And she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia."" He singled out other Republicans who lost because, he said, they did not embrace him. ""Didn't want the embrace,"" he said repeatedly. One Republican Mr. Trump did embrace on Wednesday was Vice President Mike Pence. Asked if he would commit to keeping Mr. Pence on the ticket in 2020, the president said, ""Well, I haven't asked him, but I hope so."" Then, spotting Mr. Pence in the audience, he said, ""Mike, will you be my running mate?"" Mr. Pence stood up and nodded that he would. Turning back to the reporter, Mr. Trump said, ""The answer is yes, O.K.? The turnover in the House foreshadowed a sharp change in Mr. Trump's presidency. A Democratic House not only can block Mr. Trump's priorities like building a wall along the southern border and repealing Mr. Obama's health care program, but it also can use subpoena power to investigate all manner of issues that he had been protected from until now. Among other things, Democrats are likely to demand the release of tax returns that he has kept secret, look into his business dealings and reopen the House investigation into any ties between Mr. Trump's team and Russia during the 2016 election. ""The American people will see his tax returns, not because of any voyeuristic interest, but because they should know if he is corrupt,"" Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on NBC News. ""And we will look at the cashing in of access to the Oval Office and that has been concerning and his financial entanglements overseas."" After Mr. Sessions was fired later in the day, Representatives Jerry Nadler of New York and Adam Schiff of California, the incoming chairmen of the judiciary and intelligence committees, vowed to take action. ""The firing of Jeff Sessions will be investigated and people will be held accountable,"" Mr. Nadler said. ""If the president seeks to interfere in the impartial administration of justice, the Congress must stop him,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""No one is above the law."" Mr. Trump opened his news conference with an embrace of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, and endorsed her bid to regain the speakership that she lost eight years ago. He even suggested that it may be better for him that Democrats won the House because he can make deals with them, while legislating with a narrower Republican majority might have been more difficult. ""There are many things we can get along on without a lot of trouble, that we agree very much with them and they agree with us,"" Mr. Trump said, citing health care, pharmaceutical drug prices, the environment and infrastructure. ""I would like to see bipartisanship. I'd like to see unity. Maybe not on everything, but I think we have a very good chance of seeing that."" Yet talk of compromise quickly turned to confrontation as he said he would fight fire with fire if Democrats follow through on their vows to use the subpoena power. ""They can play that game, but we can play better because we have a thing called the United States Senate and a lot of very questionable things were done, between leaks of classified information and many other elements that should not have taken place,"" he said. For her part, Ms. Pelosi said she hoped that this would be a ""new era"" and noted that she worked productively with Mr. Bush when Democrats held the House during his last two years in office. ""The fact is we'd like to work together so legislation would be bipartisan,"" she said. But Ms. Pelosi said Democrats would not curb their aspirations in the interest of compromise. ""We're not going for the lowest common denominator,"" she said. ""We're going for the boldest common denominator."" While he has presented himself as a natural negotiator from his time in real estate, Mr. Trump has made almost no deals with opposition Democrats since taking office. Mr. Trump had one brief moment of comity with Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, when they agreed to a short-term spending deal, but it quickly evaporated amid disagreement over immigration. The news conference, only his third formal solo session with reporters at the White House since he took office 22 months ago, showcased his toxic relationship with the news media. He complained repeatedly that he had been treated unfairly and engaged in several heated exchanges with reporters who questioned him. ""You're a very rude person,"" he told Mr. Acosta, the CNN reporter, who persisted in pressing him after the president was ready to move on and sought to keep a White House intern from taking the microphone away from him. When an NBC reporter stuck up for Mr. Acosta, Mr. Trump retorted, ""Well, I'm not a big fan of yours either."" He snapped at a third reporter who tried to ask a question. ""Sit down,"" he said. ""I didn't call you."" When a fourth reporter, who is black, asked if he had emboldened white supremacists by adopting the label ""nationalist"" during the campaign, he lashed out. ""That's such a racist question,"" he said, jabbing a finger at her. By the evening, the White House suspended Mr. Acosta's White House hard pass issued by the Secret Service granting journalists access to the building, falsely accusing him of ""placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern."" Reporters sitting nearby said that was an untrue characterization of what had happened."
News,2018-11-07,"SYDNEY — Li Ka-shing may be one of the most influential businessmen in Asia, but that reputation — and fear of Chinese influence — is working against his company’s ambitions to buy a critical gas operation in Australia.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/business/australia-ck-group-apa-group-li-ka-shing.html,615," SYDNEY — Li Ka-shing may be one of the most influential businessmen in Asia, but that reputation — and fear of Chinese influence — is working against his company's ambitions to buy a critical gas operation in Australia. The Australian government, seeking to balance national security interests and economic growth, said on Wednesday that it was likely to block CK Group, a company led by Mr. Li, a Hong Kong billionaire, from acquiring APA Group, the country's largest gas and pipeline company. A final decision is expected in two weeks, according to a Treasury statement. In February, Australia's Treasury announced it was tightening rules on investments in electricity and agriculture because of questions about China's influence on such deals. As much as $90 billion in Chinese investment has flowed to Australia since 2007. Australia's treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said his ""preliminary view"" of CK Group's bid of 12.98 billion Australian dollars ($9.6 billion) was to turn it down because it ""would be contrary to the national interest."" ""I have formed this view on the grounds that it would result in an undue concentration of foreign ownership by a single company group in our most significant gas transmission business,"" Mr. Frydenberg said in a statement. CK Group said in a separate statement that ""the preliminary view is not an adverse reflection on the CK Group, and that the Australian Government welcomes CK Group's investments in Australia and its broader contribution to the Australian economy."" Mr. Li's companies already have substantial interests in Australia, but their attempts at acquiring utilities have had mixed results. The Australian government cleared the group's takeover of gas and electricity distributor Duet Group in 2017; a year earlier it had blocked a joint bid for a state electricity distributor. This year, as the bid for the gas pipeline was under review and scrutiny over foreign acquisitions increased, CK Group attempted to allay concerns about the Chinese government's influence. Andy Hunter, CK's deputy chief executive, called the criticism and the concern about foreign investment as misinformed and disappointing. ""We are a properly governed, publicly-listed company and for anyone to suggest otherwise is sadly misinformed. The idea that we are in some way influenced by the Chinese government,"" Mr. Hunter told the Australian Financial Review in September, was ""fictitious to say the least."" The bid was cleared by the Australian competition watchdog but needed approval from by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Treasurer. The review board was unable to reach a unanimous recommendation, according to Mr. Frydenberg's statement. While the competition watchdog approved the bid, it hadn't considered ""the concentration of foreign ownership."" Mr. Frydenberg said that APA Group's size, which accounts for 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles) of pipelines, representing 56 percent of Australia's gas pipeline transmission system, was among his biggest concerns regarding the bid. The operation also includes three-quarters of all pipeline along the country's eastern coast. The news comes as the Australian government embarks on a campaign to revitalize relations with Beijing that have been strained since June when the government of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull passed national security legislation that bans foreign interference in politics. Government officials said at the time that the law was not aimed at any single country but the decision came months after newly released Australian electoral returns showed businesses with links to China had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to political parties in 2016. In August, the Australian government blocked Chinese technology giant Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE, from providing equipment to support the country's new telecommunications networks. Government ministers said at the time that companies that ""are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government"" posed unacceptable security risks."
Op-Ed,2018-11-07,"After Donald Trump won the election in 2016, he was in a position of great power to cut taxes, repeal Obamacare and build border walls to his heart’s content — if congressional Republicans cooperated.

Of course, they didn't always cooperate, but Mr. Trump was also able to push forward his agenda using the presidency's unilateral powers — to deregulate, start trade wars and expel undocumented immigrants — and his power to appoint conservative judges with the consent of the Senate. That was then. When newly elected members of Congress take their seats in January, creating a Democratic majority in the House, the president's power will shrink — not to nothing but significantly. The reason is not that a hostile Congress will block legislation that Mr. Trump seeks. Even without party control of both houses, many presidents employed their unilateral powers and skillful deal-making to score political victories. Ronald Reagan cut taxes, weakened regulations and negotiated historic nuclear arms reduction agreements with the Soviet Union. Bill Clinton pursued his New Democrat vision with a largely Republican-dominated Congress. George W. Bush's ""war on terror"" was almost entirely formulated by the executive branch. Barack Obama pursued several progressive measures — in the areas of immigration, affirmative action and campus speech — on his own. Nor is Mr. Trump's problem impeachment, at least, not in the short term. Removal requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate, and Republicans will almost certainly not oblige. No, Mr. Trump's power will shrivel for another reason: the interaction of congressional oversight and his chaotic, divisive and corrupt administration. Congress has so far used its oversight powers reluctantly. Republicans want to protect Mr. Trump, not embarrass him. That will change with Democratic control of the House. Committees will hold hearings on potential election collusion with Russia, of course, but also Mr. Trump's immigration enforcement policies, including family separation, his financial entanglements with the federal government, nepotism in the White House and allegations of corruption in the Trump Organization. Remember Whitewater? That single shady real estate transaction spawned a five-year investigation that consumed much of Mr. Clinton's presidency. President Trump and the Trump Organization have (or so it has been alleged) been involved in dozens if not hundreds of shady transactions. The parade of witnesses will be long. The president seems to expect his aides to corroborate the alternative reality he tweets out in the dead of morning, but they, not he, face perjury convictions if they do. Those witnesses will confirm accounts of dysfunction already leaked to the media, further damaging the president's standing. Congress will demand to see Mr. Trump's tax records and other financial documents. The bonanza of information will put him into jeopardy of further criminal investigation as well as civil lawsuits and, of course, bad press. The investigations will also clog the gears of his already notoriously inefficient administration. The subpoenas alone will sap resources and damage morale. While Mr. Trump can still push agencies to deregulate, hold the line on immigration enforcement, raise tariffs and tear up treaties, every action will invite a new congressional inquiry, along with a blizzard of subpoenas and another parade of witnesses if — as so often seems the case — it is accompanied by leaks that suggest procedural irregularity, internal disagreement or impropriety. The White House will fight back by claiming executive privilege. This hazy area of the law provides many opportunities for delay, confusion and conflict. But executive privilege cannot be used to disrupt investigations into criminal matters, and most presidents have felt constrained to allow inquiries into serious allegations of unethical conduct.  Will Mr. Trump? He could order his subordinates not to answer subpoenas. He could certainly get them to drag their feet. And while Congress could refer those officials to the Justice Department for prosecution for contempt, the department's longstanding policy is not to prosecute officials who keep silent based on executive privilege. But Congress can go directly to the courts to obtain a declaration that an official is in contempt, and — in extremis — arrest and detain him itself. This won't happen, but expect some tense moments. With or without executive-branch cooperation, Congress will uncover suspicious activities, which it will refer to the Justice Department. Attorney General Jeff Sessions (or his successor) will be pressured to appoint special counsels. These new Robert Muellers could generate new clashes with the president, whose distrust of the Justice Department will reach new heights. If Mr. Trump survives these conflicts, he will be badly wounded. Unless the Democrats rescue him. A premature impeachment inquiry could do just that. Bill Clinton's popularity soared after the Republicans' attempt to remove him from office blew up in their faces in 1999. No president has been pushed out of office except Richard Nixon, whose poll numbers languished in the 20s for months before his resignation and who finally lost the support of leading Republicans as well. Mr. Trump's numbers have stayed near or above 40 percent for most of his tenure, and he has a stranglehold on the Republican Party. In existential contests between Congress and the presidency, Congress can't win without overwhelming public support. The presidency enjoys too many inherent advantages over a clumsy multimember body that is deeply unpopular and divided with conflicts. Mr. Trump can't be defeated, not until 2020. But if Congress acts wisely, he can be constrained. Eric Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.

Op-Ed,2018-11-08,"Well, that was bittersweet.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/trump-midterms-sessions-russia.html,898," Well, that was bittersweet. I'm not sure I would call Tuesday's election results the blue wave many expected, but liberals absolutely made progress — and history — as Democrats assumed control of the House of Representatives, in part by electing a historic number of women to the body. Furthermore, the incredible diversity of the newly elected Democratic class offers a more comprehensive reflection of the current contours of the nation. But there was also heartbreak, as Republicans increased their margin in the Senate and some acclaimed liberal hopefuls in the South came close but fell short. That may temper excitement, but it shouldn't erase it. Whenever a chamber of Congress changes hands, it is a big deal. This is an even bigger deal, because it represents the first real legislative check on Donald Trump's power as president since he took office. Under Republicans, the House of Representatives made a mockery of its oversight responsibility, if not abandoned it altogether. Trump grew bolder and more brazen as he realized that there would be no political price to pay for his rhetoric and his actions. The Republican representatives were cowed before the pig. Democrats will now investigate and subpoena, which is a necessary and powerful function of the legislature. But it is also true that Trump sees part of the election outcome as a validation and an endorsement. The remaining Republicans in the House may be more Trump-friendly. Trump will no doubt see this all as encouragement to continue his racism, his attacks on the truth and on the press, and to expand his corruption. He has already moved to potentially change the infrastructure of the Russia investigation being conducted by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. On Wednesday, Trump requested the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and received it. Matthew Whitaker, Sessions's chief of staff, will replace him, at least on an acting basis. Before he became chief of staff last year, CNN described Mr. Whitaker this way: ""Matthew Whitaker is a CNN legal commentator and former U.S. attorney who directs the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), a conservative ethics watchdog group. He ran in the Republican primary for Iowa Senate in 2014."" In an article Mr. Whitaker wrote then for CNN under the headline ""Mueller's Investigation of Trump Is Going Too Far,"" he complained: It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump's finances or his family's finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else. That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel. In another part of the article Whitaker wrote: Any investigation into President Trump's finances or the finances of his family would require Mueller to return to Rod Rosenstein for additional authority under Mueller's appointment as special counsel. If he were to continue to investigate the financial relationships without a broadened scope in his appointment, then this would raise serious concerns that the special counsel's investigation was a mere witch hunt. If Mueller is indeed going down this path, Rosenstein should act to ensure the investigation is within its jurisdiction and within the authority of the original directive. It is unclear at this point how this staff change will affect Mueller and his investigation, now that oversight for his work is being taken away from Rosenstein. But there is no way to view this move and not worry about the future of the investigation. Trump now has at least two avenues to appoint a permanent successor to Jeff Sessions: Send a new nominee before a more favorable Senate with even more Republican votes, or make a recess appointment over the holidays. As Steve Vladeck pointed out last year in Slate: Article II, Section 2, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution empowers the president ""to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session."" And as the Supreme Court concluded three years ago in the Noel Canning case, ""the Recess of the Senate"" can include just about any formal recess that lasts 10 or more days — no matter whether it's an intersession or intrasession recess — and the vacancy at issue need not arise during the recess. (Both these holdings were over the nominal dissents of four of the more conservative justices.) As Vladeck explained, the Senate need only recess for 10 or more days with no formal business on the Senate floor — for the Christmas holidays, for instance — and ""Trump could simply recess-appoint whoever he wants to serve as attorney general until the end of the next Senate session."" In this case, that next session would end in January 2020. The incoming Democratic majority in the House would have absolutely no say in this. Democrats did well in the elections for the House in part because representation there is a reflection of where people are. The Senate, on the other hand, is tied to land. Indeed, the fewer people in these states, many of them solidly Republican, the more weight each person's vote carries. The Electoral College lives between the two equations. This, I believe, is why Trump focused his 11th-hour push on Senate races instead of House ones. Trump is solidifying power as a means of self-defense. Trump's strategy is to survive at all costs.

News,2018-11-08,SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon may not be the only technology giant considering a big expansion in New York.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/technology/google-expansion-new-york.html,678," SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon may not be the only technology giant considering a big expansion in New York. Google is in discussions to move into a planned 1.3 million square foot office complex at the St. John's Terminal building on Manhattan's West Side, according to a person with knowledge of the company's plans but not permitted to speak about it publicly. The property, which is expected to be completed in 2022, would allow the internet giant to significantly increase its presence in the city. Google employs around 7,000 in New York, and a space that size could allow it to more than double its local work force. The potential expansion, reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, comes on the heels of news that Amazon appears close to building a corporate office in the city. According to two people briefed on the negotiations, Amazon is close to naming Long Island City, a fast-growing neighborhood on the western edge of Queens, as one of two locations that would together house as many as 50,000 employees. Amazon's so-called HQ2 effort, a search for a second corporate headquarters outside of Seattle, has dragged on for about a year. Many were surprised when word leaked last week that the e-commerce company could end up with two new big offices instead of one. The other would be in Northern Virginia, outside of Washington. Amazon's potential arrival in Long Island City has some in the city hoping that New York could one day rival Silicon Valley as a tech hub. It has also raised concerns about whether the local infrastructure could handle such a rapid expansion. Google opened its first office in New York 18 years ago, but the company's ever-expanding work force has driven demand for larger offices and more staffing in the city. In March, Google spent $2.4 billion to buy the Chelsea Market building in Manhattan, where the company had set up some of its New York offices. The Chelsea office is Google's main workplace in the city, housing product and business teams for web search, ads and sales. A Google spokeswoman said it was also planning to add an additional 320,000 square feet of space with the redevelopment of Pier 57. The search for local real estate is part of a general expansion in the United States for Alphabet, Google's parent company. Last month, Alphabet said it had hired 9,000 employees in the United States this year, raising its total to 94,372 as of September. That was an increase of more than 16,000 from a year earlier. St. John's Terminal is being developed in Hudson Square by Oxford Properties, a Toronto-based developer. The 12-story building will incorporate a former freight terminal for the High Line and showcases rail beds as a central design feature. As tech companies expand in New York, they are likely to compete with Wall Street for engineering talent. New York has always had a significant technology industry of its own, though it has been dwarfed by the financial industry. For years, the city has ranked second or third among communities in the United States in total tech venture capital investment — with Silicon Valley and its surrounding area far and away the leader. New York's technology work force is also among the nation's largest, with many computer engineers working on the enormous data systems that power big financial institutions. Roughly 25 percent of Goldman Sachs's work force, for example, is dedicated to technology tasks, according to reports. Facebook also has a big office in New York, as do many other Silicon Valley companies. One of Microsoft's most important research labs is in the city. And some of the industry's most advanced research in complex and superfast computing systems is being done in New York, largely because of work with the big banks. But one thing the city has not been able to claim in a long time is a technology powerhouse of its own. The closest home of a tech heavyweight is Armonk, N.Y, about 40 miles away, where IBM is based. (IBM also has major offices in Manhattan.)"

Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. A resignation in Washington, a growing gun culture in Italy and anger over collapsed buildings in France. Here's the latest: • ""Dear Mr. President, at your request I am submitting my resignation."" President Trump removed Attorney General Jeff Sessions, above, an effective implementer of his agenda who became a punching bag after recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Matthew Whitaker, Mr. Sessions's chief of staff and a Trump loyalist, will become acting attorney general — and will oversee the investigation, whose scope he has criticized as verging on a ""witch hunt."" Senior officials in the Justice Department are intensely suspicious of him, some seeing him as a White House spy. Mr. Whitaker has the power to block new moves by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and he could choose not to release the findings. The shake-up thus presents a stark challenge to the resolve of the new Democratic majority in the House, which will be seated in January. At a news conference in which he bickered with reporters, Mr. Trump offered to work with Democrats but threatened a ""warlike"" posture if they investigate him. Afterward he suspended the White House credentials of Jim Acosta of CNN, a very rare step. While Republicans' disarray didn't stop them from gaining two Senate seats, Democrats showed focus and flipped 28 in the House. Voters offered a portrait of a nation at odds with itself, while also electing the first Muslim and Native American women to Congress, among a series of historical firsts. Here's what the blue wave looked like, and why it was impressive. Many important races are still undecided. _____ • Gun culture in Italy.  The most powerful figure in Italy's populist government, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, above, has promoted himself as a law-and-order tough guy, cracking down on immigration, declaring a war on drugs and creating a sense of public safety emergency. And he's trying to import American-style gun culture. While campaigning earlier this year, Mr. Salvini pledged to cooperate with a group advocating looser gun laws, and in September they notched a victory when the government made it possible to own more guns, including the semiautomatic AR-15. Italy's gun lobby doesn't have the clout the N.R.A. wields in the U.S., but it is growing. _____ • A Russian theater director goes on trial.  Kirill Serebrennikov, above, renowned across Europe and beyond, is charged in a financial fraud case that is seen by Russia's intelligentsia as a test of artistic freedom under President Vladimir Putin. He and three co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to conspiring to embezzle more than $2 million in government funds in a Kremlin-sponsored art project. They face up to 10 years in prison. Mr. Serebrennikov's productions at the Gogol Center, a small Moscow theater, challenged Russia's conservative culture and often featured thinly veiled criticism of Mr. Putin. The artistic community fears that Mr. Putin, having tamed the country's oligarchs and news media, may now be determined to bring the arts to heel. _____ • More concerns over Boeing instruments. Aircraft problems may have played a role in the fatal crash of a brand-new Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesia last week, investigators said. An Indonesian official suggested that inaccurate readings could have prompted the Lion Air plane to enter a sudden, automatic descent. That added a new element to what investigators have been scrutinizing, including faulty airspeed indicators and possibly flawed maintenance. Boeing has issued a worldwide bulletin on how to respond to errant data to all operators of the plane, one of the most popular in commercial aviation. The developments suggested that multiple factors may have combined to cause the crash, which killed all 189 people aboard.

""The film will show prehistoric monsters fighting one another and making weird sounds,"" The Times wrote in 1933. It was easy to see why the movie would be popular. The stop-motion special effects were groundbreaking, although film scholars saw thinly veiled racist overtones. Nevertheless, the Times reviewer was enthralled: ""Imagine a 50-foot beast with a girl in one paw climbing up the outside of the Empire State Building."" The movie, starring Fay Wray as the beauty who charms the beast, was among the first to be shown at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, shortly after the 6,200-seat theater was converted to show films. A box office hit, the movie was rereleased periodically and has featured in numerous remakes. In the original, Kong was an 18-inch puppet. In the new Broadway production, the ape is 20 feet tall and weighs 2,000 pounds. Not bad for the Eighth Wonder of the World.

News,2018-11-08,Obamacare didn’t just give more people health insurance. It also caused more people to vote.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/upshot/medicaid-expansion-voting-increase.html,804," Obamacare didn't just give more people health insurance. It also caused more people to vote. That's the conclusion of a new body of evidence that strongly suggests that giving people coverage through expansions of the Medicaid program increases their likelihood of participating in the next election. Medicaid expansions seem to raise both voter registration and voter participation, at least temporarily.  On Tuesday, voters in three states approved measures to further expand Medicaid. The election of Democratic governors in three more could also prompt new expansions. Researchers who worked on three recent studies of the effects say it's likely that those expansions will have a similar effect on voting in the next election cycle. ""We can confidently say: When you expand Medicaid eligibility, participation goes up,"" said Jake Haselswerdt, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Missouri, who wrote one of the papers. It's not clear exactly why getting Medicaid makes people more likely to vote, but there are a couple of theories. It could be that Medicaid, which has been shown to increase treatment for depression and improve financial stability, makes it easier for people to participate in the political process by giving them direct benefits. Over all, wealthier and healthier Americans tend to be more likely to vote than their poorer, sicker counterparts.  Perhaps enrollment in the program simply connected people with information about registration and voting, as it brought them into contact with government websites and case workers. Medicaid might also boost civic engagement by making people more grateful to the government and more interested in public policy. Earlier studies have shown that the creation of Social Security had a large effect on the civic participation of older Americans, and that the G.I. bill boosted participation from veterans who earned benefits under its program. ""These are programs that have a major effect on people's lives,"" said Andrea Campbell, a professor of political science at M.I.T., who wrote a book on the political legacy of Social Security. She suggested Medicaid could work similarly, by improving people's circumstances and making them more aware of the stakes of government action. A somewhat conflicting body of evidence has shown that enrollment in stigmatized programs, like cash welfare, actually depresses voting. Medicaid may be more like Social Security. Two of the recent studies looked at what happened during the big Medicaid expansions in 2014, which occurred as a result of the Affordable Care Act. A Supreme Court ruling made the expansion optional, and only about half of states expanded right away. One study, from the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, compared voting later that year between states that expanded and those that didn't. Another study, from the American Political Science Review, zoomed in more narrowly, looking just at similar counties on the borders between states that expanded and those that didn't. Both papers showed increases in voter registration and voting. In the neighboring-counties research, people in the expansion counties were more likely to register and to vote, by three to four percentage points. A third study, released as a working paper this week, looked at an earlier Medicaid expansion, when Oregon opened up its program to some childless adults in 2008. The state set up a lottery to determine who got coverage, which led to an important randomized experiment of how Medicaid coverage affects people's lives. Unlike the 2014 research, the Oregon study was able to track voting by individual, not just region. It found that the Medicaid expansion increased voter turnout by 7 percent among the newly covered group in Oregon.  Voting is private, so none of the research could say whether the new Medicaid voters supported Democrats or Republicans. Mr. Haselswerdt, who did the statewide study, said it might even be possible that some of the voting increase by Medicaid beneficiaries was matched by increased voting by expansion opposers.  But the people eligible for Medicaid expansion tend to be poor, single adults, a demographic more likely to be Democratic-leaning. And the Oregon study showed bigger voting effects in more heavily Democratic parts of the state.  Even though all the studies detected an effect of Medicaid on voting, none of them showed one that lasted. Political science research suggests that voting can be a habit-forming behavior, but that may not be the case for this particular group. In each study, the voting boost after expansion had faded by the next election. That means that the coming expansions may make an electoral difference only once. ""Medicaid coverage policy is still front and center in the political debate,"" said Katherine Baicker, a co-author on the Oregon work and the dean of the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago. ""Having this kind of information about how Medicaid coverage affects not only health and health care use and financial security, but also civic engagement, seems like a really important relationship to have a little more information about."""
News,2018-11-08,"Six weeks after settling a securities-fraud lawsuit with federal regulators, Tesla and Elon Musk have made good on one of the agreement’s key provisions — naming a new board chief to impose order on a company whose automaking has often been overshadowed by Mr. Musk’s behavior.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/business/tesla-new-chairwoman-elon-musk.html,1257," Six weeks after settling a securities-fraud lawsuit with federal regulators, Tesla and Elon Musk have made good on one of the agreement's key provisions — naming a new board chief to impose order on a company whose automaking has often been overshadowed by Mr. Musk's behavior. The company said a current director, Robyn Denholm, would become its chairwoman immediately. Mr. Musk stepped down as chairman last month but remains Tesla's chief executive. Ms. Denholm, 55, is the chief financial officer of Telstra, which dominates telecommunications in Australia. She is a longtime technology executive with experience in Silicon Valley, where Tesla is based, and once worked for Toyota in Australia. The move to replace Mr. Musk as chairman, announced late Wednesday night, was part of a settlement reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September to deal with the fallout from his assertion that he had secured funding for a private buyout of the company. That claim, in a Twitter post in August, quickly fell into doubt. (Mr. Musk later explained in a blog post that discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund led him to believe that it had both money and enthusiasm for such a deal.) Under the settlement, Tesla agreed to name a new leader for the board, splitting those responsibilities from Mr. Musk's post as chief executive, by next Tuesday. The company was also required to add two independent board members and to set up a permanent committee to monitor Mr. Musk's public declarations, including his Twitter posts. It has several weeks to complete that requirement. Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said the appointment of Ms. Denholm ""technically complies"" with the S.E.C. settlement, but he questioned how much Ms. Denholm would be able to push back against a forceful personality like Mr. Musk. ""If the goal is to provide adult supervision, it won't accomplish that,"" Mr. Gordon said. ""She's been on the board through all of the shenanigans. She never resigned in protest. She is a Musk supporter. If it doesn't work out, she will be the one who leaves. It won't be Musk who leaves."" Mr. Musk has galvanized investors and the public imagination with his sleek electric cars and his big dreams for space travel and other ambitions. But his public declarations increasingly unnerved Tesla shareholders and the directors who represent them. Production problems only added to those concerns. Tesla reported a substantial profit in the third quarter, powered by a significant jump in production and sales of its Model 3 sedan. The earnings beat the expectations of many analysts and eased worries about its finances, for now. In the first half of 2018, the company reported losses and used up more than $1 billion in cash. ""They are doing much better than we thought they would a quarter ago,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. ""You have to give them credit for that."" Yet Tesla still faces challenges. It must prove it can sustain profits in the fourth quarter and beyond, pay out more than $1 billion to bondholders over the next few months, address quality issues and fix a chaotic delivery system. Tesla has also had an exodus of senior executives. It has had three chief accounting officers this year. And while the fraud suit with the S.E.C. has been settled, Tesla's past production forecasts for the Model 3 are still being examined by the agency. ""In just about every area, they've had extraordinary volatility,"" Mr. Sonnenfeld said. David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar who follows Tesla, said the appointment of Ms. Denholm was ""a good balance"" and was probably best for Tesla's stock price. Bringing in a hard-nosed outsider ""who wouldn't put up with Elon's Twitter nonsense,"" he added, ""would clash with Elon and it wouldn't work at all."" Tesla shares rose almost 1 percent on Thursday. Still, Mr. Whiston also expressed doubts about how much Ms. Denholm will be able to constrain Mr. Musk. In the last few weeks, the chief executive referred to the S.E.C. on Twitter as the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission,"" and then announced that he no longer had a title at Tesla, raising questions about whether he would continue to have the final word, even with a new leader of the board. ""It's troubling to me that since the settlement Elon has already made a mockery of the S.E.C. twice,"" Mr. Whiston said. He said Mr. Musk should ""stop playing games and just make the darn cars."" Ms. Denholm, a Tesla director since 2014, is one of nine members of a board whose independence has been an issue. In June, shareholders put forward proposals to split the jobs of chief executive and chairman and to deny re-election to some incumbent directors — including Mr. Musk's brother, Kimbal. Tesla said the measures were overwhelmingly rejected. Mr. Musk himself holds about one-fifth of the company's shares. Mr. Sonnenfeld said he would have preferred to see Tesla name a chairman with deep automotive experience, like Alan Mulally or Mark Fields, both former Ford Motor chief executives. ""It would do them good to get somebody who knows how to run the production process without sleeping on the factory floor,"" he said. Ms. Denholm's exposure to the auto industry came in her seven years at Toyota Motor Corporation Australia, where she was national manager for finance, before leaving in 1996 for Sun Microsystems, a onetime Silicon Valley powerhouse later acquired by Oracle. Before her current position at Telstra, Ms. Denholm was an executive at Juniper Networks, which makes computer networking equipment, for about a decade. She has both Australian and American citizenship. Tesla said Ms. Denholm would step down from her role at Telstra once her six-month notice period is complete. Mr. Whiston said Ms. Denholm's plan to leave Telstra ""shows commitment to Tesla to make sure this oversight is done properly."" But Professor Gordon cautioned that once she left her Telstra position, being chairwoman of Tesla ""will be her full-time gig,"" making her less likely to confront Mr. Musk. ""It will be a job she doesn't want to lose,"" he said. Mr. Musk heralded the change in typical fashion — on Twitter. In the Tesla announcement, Mr. Musk cited Ms. Denholm's experience and years with his company. ""Robyn has extensive experience in both the tech and auto industries, and she has made significant contributions as a Tesla board member over the past four years in helping us become a profitable company,"" he said. ""I look forward to working even more closely with Robyn as we continue accelerating the advent of sustainable energy."" In August, Mr. Musk told The New York Times that this year ""has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,"" in part because of the pressure of running Tesla, and that he sometimes took the insomnia drug Ambien to sleep. Some board members worried the drug was contributing to his late-night Twitter sessions. In addition to his troublesome tweet about a buyout, Mr. Musk had a nasty social media battle with a British diver involved in the daring rescue of 12 boys in a flooded cave in Thailand over the summer — a spat he had to quickly walk back. In September, he appeared to briefly smoke marijuana during an interview with Joe Rogan, a comedian. The interview took place in California, where recreational marijuana use is legal. Now the question is whether Mr. Musk can conform to the more conventional corporate culture that Ms. Denholm is meant to represent."
News,2018-11-08,"JB Reefer was always on the lookout for a place to buy, even before he met Erica Romero, who would become Erica Reefer, three years ago.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/realestate/the-beauty-of-a-no-nothing-walk-up.html,985," JB Reefer was always on the lookout for a place to buy, even before he met Erica Romero, who would become Erica Reefer, three years ago. ""I've lived in a shocking number of apartments, and a lot of things that are bad about New York go away when you own your place,"" he said, noting that rising rents constitute ""a core human misery in New York."" The couple, who were engaged a year after they met, later shared a two-bedroom rental for $2,500 a month on the ground floor of a house in Astoria, Queens. ""JB loves real estate,"" Mrs. Reefer said. ""He is always scoping it out and seeing what is on the market. I am along for the ride. We wanted to start putting our money toward our future."" In Astoria, the couple, both 29, found few appealing options. So they turned their attention to Manhattan, as Mr. Reefer also wanted to improve his commute to the Financial District, where he works as a software engineer. Mrs. Reefer works in Times Square, in human resources. For up to $800,000, they sought a two-bedroom — or at least something with space enough to create a second bedroom — in a co-op building. ""I am pro co-op because I want to live in a nice place with neighbors who also want a nice place,"" Mrs. Reefer said. ""It is such a big deal to be buying an apartment that I want to be surrounded by people who also care about where they live."" One priority was a dishwasher. Mr. Reefer does all the cooking and Mrs. Reefer much of the cleaning up. In Astoria, they got by with a countertop dishwasher that attached to the kitchen sink. They also wanted to avoid full-service buildings. Mr. Reefer's two dads live in a Yorkville co-op, ""with porters, doormen, gardeners and paint guys, and there is so much tipping and all those rules,"" he said. ""I am in my 20s. I can carry things upstairs. I wanted an old-school, tenement-style, no-elevator, no-nothing walk-up.""  They emailed about a listing in a beautiful Gramercy Park building, circa 1928, that they found on StreetEasy, and heard from Karen Kostiw, a licensed saleswoman at Warburg Realty. The price was $795,000 when they saw it, having dropped from $975,000. Maintenance was around $1,250 a month. The master bedroom was less than 100 square feet, and the Pullman kitchen was advertised as ""smart, sleek and the perfect size for the city dweller."" That meant a dorm-size refrigerator and minimal counter space. ""It was less of a kitchen than in most hotels I've stayed in,"" Mr. Reefer said. ""I think that apartment is for a pied-à-terre or for the kind of person, like my friends, who don't cook but just order out."" The apartment later sold for $750,000. In Greenwich Village, a two-bedroom in a charming walk-up was going for around $700,000, with maintenance of $1,000. It seemed ""incredible for the price, and there was probably a reason for that,"" Mrs. Reefer said. ""We were blinded by the address and the cool neighborhood."" As it turned out, a single investor owned most of the co-op shares in the building and was renting many of the units, making a mortgage difficult to obtain. ""The fantasy was we would find something really cheap by being smarter than everybody else, but it was never that realistic,"" Mr. Reefer said. Still, they had fun frequenting open houses, lining up an itinerary for the day and stopping for brunch. ""A two-bedroom the size they were looking for at that price point is not an easy find,"" Ms. Kostiw said. She suggested their luck would improve on the Upper East Side. It did. One option was on a ground floor in Yorkville, listed at $765,000, with maintenance of around $1,150. It had a second bathroom, but was in rough shape. ""You would need to be somebody like my little brother, who works in construction, to buy that place,"" Mr. Reefer said. The couple also wasn't keen on the street-level location, having spent months smelling the smoke and listening to the conversations of people walking past their Astoria rental. And they were indifferent to the shared garden. The apartment remains on the market for $729,000. ""We were a little obsessive at this point,"" Mrs. Reefer said. ""We knew every apartment under $800,000 in Manhattan. We were either not interested, or we saw it in person."" Then, one chilly day, a new Yorkville listing appeared on a high floor in just the kind of building they liked. In a downpour, they took a cab from Astoria and arrived to find an empty open house. By the end of it, they were still the only ones on the sign-in sheet. They loved the long, narrow layout, which meant fresh air and a cross-breeze, as well as the modern kitchen, with a dishwasher and the bonus of a combination washer-dryer. Stepping inside ""was like when I met Erica,"" Mr. Reefer said. ""It was a completely different thing."" They offered $650,000 on an asking price of $725,000, settling at $690,000. Maintenance is just under $1,500.  After they moved in last winter with their two cats, the couple, who were married last summer, made some minor repairs: adding window screens, changing light fixtures and removing old wires that prevented a door and a window from closing. They jettisoned much of their old furniture and gave the countertop dishwasher to their old upstairs neighbors. ""All the stuff we had that looked O.K. in a shabby apartment in Astoria looks terrible in here,"" Mr. Reefer said.  He carries things upstairs; she puts them away. Most of all, they are pleased to be homeowners. ""If somebody tracks garbage in the hallway, I will pick it up because I own the place,"" Mr. Reefer said. ""It's my first homeownership experience, and it's very different from renting,"" he said. ""Kind of like how being married is different from dating.""

News,2018-11-08,Good Thursday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/business/dealbook/corporate-america-midterms.html,1743," Good Thursday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.) The Dow Jones industrial average climbed almost 550 points yesterday. The S&P 500 enjoyed its biggest postelection rally in 30 years. Why? Per Barron's: ""It's finally over."" Corporate leaders still have much to fear, including President Trump's trade fight with China. But they view Washington gridlock as largely positive, as it will ward off sweeping policy changes that could upset the strong environment for business. (These are the economic indicators that will show if that theory holds.) Here are some other key corporate takeaways from the midterms: • Energy: Renewables companies benefited from Democratic victories on the state level, where a lot of energy policy is set. Oil producers suffered setbacks in some states, but blocked a carbon tax initiative in Washington State. • Tech: Both parties are expected to come together on potential new privacy regulations, but they are likely to clash on net neutrality rules. • Health care: Insurance providers are happy that no repeal of the Affordable Care Act is on the table. Both Democrats and Mr. Trump want to lower drug prices, but it's unclear what they can accomplish. • Finance: Representative Maxine Waters of California, a skeptic of the industry, is likely to take over the House Financial Services Committee. Among her expected targets is Deutsche Bank, which she wants to scrutinize over its ties to Mr. Trump. • Taxes: Mr. Trump said yesterday that he's open to a rise in corporate taxes — which he cut last year to 21 percent from 35 percent — to pay for a middle-class tax cut. One big boon for business: Continued Republican control of the Senate, which will help Mr. Trump to keep adding judges that are seen as favorable to corporate interests. ____________________________ Today's DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London. ____________________________ The automaker chose Robyn Denholm, the C.F.O. of the Australian telecommunications company Telstra, to replace Elon Musk as chair of the company's board. Ms. Denholm has been an independent director at Tesla since 2014, and will step down from her role at Telstra. The move is the result of a settlement between Tesla and the S.E.C. over Mr. Musk's tweets about plans to take the company private. To end a lawsuit over the posts, the S.E.C. demanded that the automaker separate the roles of chairman and C.E.O., and Mr. Musk is now unable to serve as chairman for three years. Tim Higgins of the WSJ considers Ms. Denholm's appointment: The decision thrusts into one of the brightest spotlights in American business a woman who is little known in the U.S. but has extensive experience as a finance executive in Silicon Valley and her native Australia. As a Tesla board member, Ms. Denholm has provided some rare automotive experience to a company that prides itself on being an industry outsider. She spent seven years at Toyota Motor Corp. in Australia, where she was a senior financial manager. More Tesla news: The venture capitalist Tim Draper says that Elon Musk should have tried to take the company private sooner. It isn't just Amazon that's reportedly planning to open huge new offices there. The NYT reports that Google is in discussions to move into a planned 1.3 million-square-foot office complex at the St. John's Terminal building on the West Side of Manhattan. Google currently employs around 7,000 people in New York. The new space could house up to 8,500 people, according to the WSJ. As it expands throughout the city, the company could eventually have space for as many as 20,000 staff members. With Amazon also reportedly planning to locate half of its proposed HQ2 (and about 25,000 jobs) in Long Island City, Queens, New York could become a tech hub. Not everyone will be pleased about that: Daisuke Wakabayashi of the NYT notes that ""as tech companies expand in New York, they are likely to compete with Wall Street for engineering talent."" Amazon HQ2 news: What we don't know about its plan to split the new office in two. What it could mean for Long Island City's infrastructure. And how the decision could leave the rest of the country behind. The Fed announces its latest policies. The central bank isn't expected to raise rates today. Some economists believe it could point to softening business investment and housing markets as signs of slowing growth. President Trump has long been expected to replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Yesterday, he did. But the new acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, has been publicly skeptical of the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Though Mr. Trump has said that he won't fire Mr. Mueller, Mr. Whitaker could make the special counsel's job much harder. He could slash Mr. Mueller's budget — an idea he floated last year — or block off lines of inquiry, like Mr. Trump's finances. Democrats have called on Mr. Whitaker to recuse himself, given his previous public comments. Expect the political battling to drag on. More on Mr. Sessions: Cannabis stocks jumped yesterday on the news of his ouster because of his opposition to legalizing marijuana. Hedge funds suffered their worst October in seven years, according to Hedge Fund Research. Energy and tech stocks are to blame for their poor performance, according to Lindsay Fortado of the FT: H.F.R.'s equity hedge fund index fell 4.25 percent in October — its worst performance in nearly three years — while the index that tracks funds that invest in technology stocks fared the worst, with a decline of 4.7 percent. Those strategies weren't even the worst performers for the month. That title went to H.F.R.'s index that tracked funds that invest in energy stocks, which was down just over 8 percent for October. Among the losers: Dan Loeb's Third Point, which lost 6.7 percent, and Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, which was down 8.4 percent. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital Management, which has struggled so far in 2018, was among the few funds that showed a gain. The renminbi has slid in value for months, but the country has been working hard to keep it from plummeting. The FT reports that China spent roughly $32 billion in foreign exchange reserves to strengthen the currency last month, the heaviest monthly investment into propping up the renminbi in almost two years. Analysts broadly think that China sees a renminbi exchange rate of 7 to the dollar as a big psychological barrier (the currency is currently just below that level). The big spending suggests that is the case, but the FT also notes that the Chinese central bank is treading a careful line to avoid eroding its foreign exchange reserves below $3 trillion. The news may assuage some concerns about whether China is unfairly manipulating its currency. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned China not to reduce the renminbi's value as a weapon in its trade war with the U.S. Goldman Sachs named 69 new partners, its smallest class in three decades, but also its most diverse to date. CDK, a maker of software for car dealerships, hired Brian Krzanich, the former Intel C.E.O., as its new chief executive. Tom Barrack ousted Richard Saltzman as C.E.O. of Colony Capital and took the role for himself. Vice Media will shrink its staff by up to 15 percent through a hiring freeze and close at least half of its websites. Toshiba plans to cut 7,000 jobs over the next five years.

briefing,2018-11-08, (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/briefing/thousand-oaks-jeff-sessions-tesla.html,1405,"  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: At least 12 people, including a sheriff's deputy, were killed late Wednesday in a shooting at a country and western dance hall in Thousand Oaks, Calif., officials said. The gunman is also dead, officials said, adding that there was no longer a threat to the public after the shooting at the dance hall, the Borderline Bar and Grill, which was holding an event for college students. • The location: Thousand Oaks, a relatively affluent city in Ventura County, is about 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. President Trump replaced Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday with Matthew Whitaker, who has questioned the scope of the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Sessions, who resigned at the president's request, recused himself in March 2017 from overseeing the investigation, citing his role in Mr. Trump's campaign. Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, has been overseeing the inquiry. As acting attorney general, Mr. Whitaker now has that responsibility. He has said that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, would be going too far if he examined the Trump family finances. • Profile: Mr. Whitaker, Mr. Sessions's chief of staff and a former U.S. attorney, has been forging ties to the White House, where he is seen as a reliable ally. • Looking back: Mr. Sessions helped promote Mr. Trump's agenda, particularly on immigration and in addressing violent crime and opioids, but his recusal from the Russia investigation cost him the president's support. • What's next: One of our Washington correspondents answered questions about the implications of Mr. Sessions's firing. transcript After a roller-coaster tenure as attorney general, Jeff Sessions was forced to resign. He's been on the president's hit list ever since he recused himself from the Russia investigation shortly after taking office. ""I should not be involved investigating a campaign I had a role in."" As recently as August, Trump went after Sessions, tweeting that ""Jeff Sessions should stop this rigged witch hunt right now."" In June it was more of the same. ""Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself. I would have quickly picked someone else."" The grudge goes back even further. This was Trump in 2017: ""So Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself. I then have — which frankly, I think is very unfair to the president."" A week later at a press conference with the Lebanese prime minister, he continued to lash out. ""I told you before, I'm very disappointed with the attorney general. But we will see what happens. Time will tell. Time will tell."" Sessions was one of Trump's earliest establishment supporters. But that was then. Now, President Trump will appoint a new attorney general and potentially clear the way to derail the Russia inquiry. A day after his party lost control of the House, President Trump threatened to adopt a ""warlike posture"" if Democrats used their new power to investigate his financial and political dealings. He made his remarks at a news conference that started with an offer to work across party lines. He went on to scold reporters whose questions or behavior he didn't like, including Jim Acosta of CNN, whose White House credentials were suspended by the end of the day. • The House: Democrats made gains by focusing on health care, while Republicans lost their grip on unity and messaging, our correspondents write. • The Senate: Republican wins have strengthened the influence of social conservatives, who are seeking to push harder to the right on issues including abortion. • Election firsts: There will be at least 100 women in the House next year. Here are some others who made history on Tuesday. • Too close to call: Several races, including the one for Georgia governor, have yet to be decided. • Partisan picks: Writers from across the political spectrum discuss the midterm elections. The goal of talks scheduled for today had been to plan a second summit meeting between President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. But the State Department announced on Wednesday that the meeting between Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and a top North Korean official had been canceled. • Mixed messages: Mr. Trump later said that the meeting would be rescheduled and that ""we're very happy with how it's going with North Korea."" • What might Democratic control of the House mean for your wallet? Tax-overhaul initiatives could be blocked, but there may be room for agreement on other measures. Here's a breakdown. • Tesla named Robyn Denholm, an Australian telecommunications executive, as its new chairwoman, as it tries to move beyond regulatory problems and concerns about Elon Musk's leadership. Mr. Musk will remain chief executive. • Google is in discussions to move into an office complex on Manhattan's West Side that could allow it to more than double its local work force of 7,000. • Canada is running low on legal marijuana three weeks after recreational use of the drug became legal.

""It'll be up in lights on Broadway: Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World!"" an adventurer exclaims in the 1933 film ""King Kong."" Eighty-five years later, a $35 million musical version with the big ape officially opens in New York tonight. Before the movie was released, the excitement was palpable, even if newspapers didn't exactly know what would be happening. ""The film will show prehistoric monsters fighting one another and making weird sounds,"" The Times wrote in 1933. It was easy to see why the movie would be popular. The stop-motion special effects were groundbreaking, although film scholars saw thinly veiled racist overtones. Nevertheless, the Times reviewer was enthralled: ""Imagine a 50-foot beast with a girl in one paw climbing up the outside of the Empire State Building."" The movie, starring Fay Wray as the beauty who charms the beast, was among the first to be shown at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, shortly after the 6,200-seat theater was converted to show films. A box office hit, the movie was rereleased periodically and has featured in numerous remakes. In the original, Kong was an 18-inch puppet. In the new Broadway production, the ape is 20 feet tall and weighs 2,000 pounds. Not bad for the Eighth Wonder of the World.

News,2018-11-08,Update: The Tai Kwun Center for Heritage and Arts said on Friday that it would host the Ma Jian events as scheduled.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/world/asia/hong-kong-ma-jian.html,973," Update: The Tai Kwun Center for Heritage and Arts said on Friday that it would host the Ma Jian events as scheduled. HONG KONG — A cultural venue run by a nonprofit organization with close ties to the Hong Kong government has abruptly canceled plans to host two events featuring an exiled Chinese writer, in what some saw as the latest sign of eroding freedoms in the city.  The cancellation came just days before the writer, Ma Jian, was scheduled to speak at the Tai Kwun Center for Heritage and Arts as part of the annual Hong Kong International Literary Festival. It left festival organizers scrambling to find a new venue for the Saturday events. ""We do not want Tai Kwun to become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual,"" Timothy Calnin, director of Tai Kwun, said in a statement sent to reporters on Thursday. ""We have therefore worked closely with the Hong Kong International Literary Festival to find a more suitable alternative venue."" Mr. Ma, 65, who is currently based in London, was scheduled to speak at a panel discussion on Hong Kong literature as well as give a talk about his new novel, ""China Dream."" Published in Britain last week, the book, whose title refers to the signature propaganda catchphrase of Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, was described by the publisher as a ""biting satire of totalitarianism that reveals what happens to a nation when it is blinded by materialism and governed by violence and lies."" While Tai Kwun, which is financed and operated by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, did not make specific reference to Mr. Ma in its statement, the venue's decision to pull out of the events came after the author wrote in a Twitter post last week that publishers in Hong Kong had declined to publish ""China Dream"" — ""the first time that's happened to one of my books."" Speaking by telephone from London, several hours before his flight to Hong Kong, the writer accused Mr. Calnin of ""turning a literary festival into a political matter."" ""He hasn't even read the book yet and he has already passed a political judgment,"" said Mr. Ma. Mr. Ma's books have been banned in mainland China ever since his first novella, ""Stick Out Your Tongue,"" a collection of short stories about the Han Chinese occupation of Tibet, was published in 1987. Mr. Ma, an outspoken critic of the Communist government whose other novels include ""Red Dust"" and ""Beijing Coma,"" lived in Hong Kong for a decade as a dissident before moving to Germany and then London. Though he has been barred from entering mainland China since 2011, Mr. Ma, a British citizen, said he has permanent resident status in Hong Kong, and he spoke at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival as recently as 2013. Tai Kwun's last-minute decision to withdraw from the events comes amid growing concerns about the future of the semiautonomous Chinese city as a haven for rule of law and civil rights in Asia. Last week, the political cartoonist Badiucao, whose works satirize leaders of mainland China and Hong Kong, called off a solo exhibition in Hong Kong one day before its opening after receiving threats from the Chinese authorities. Last month, the Hong Kong authorities expelled Victor Mallet, an editor at The Financial Times, a decision that was widely seen as retaliation for Mr. Mallet's role in hosting a talk with a local independence advocate at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong in August. And on Thursday night, Mr. Mallet was denied entry into Hong Kong as a visitor, The Financial Times said. And in recent years, Hong Kong-based publishers have come under increasing pressure, particularly following the disappearance in 2016 of several booksellers who sold gossipy titles on China's political elite. ""Before, Hong Kong was a haven for arts and literature — a place where we felt like we could hide from China and find true freedom of thought,"" said Mr. Ma. ""But now that era is slowly disappearing."" The Tai Kwun Center for Heritage and Arts opened in May after an eight-year, $484 million restoration of the 19th-century central police station compound undertaken by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the city's sole legal betting operator and largest charitable organization, in close cooperation with the city government. In 2016, the Jockey Club drew criticism when it announced a donation of $451 million to open a local branch of Beijing's Palace Museum, fueling concerns about the mainland government's growing efforts to assert its influence in Hong Kong. The museum is expected to be completed by mid-2022. Tai Kwun is the primary venue for this year's Hong Kong International Literary Festival, which runs through Sunday. Many criticized its decision to pull out of Mr. Ma's events. ""The cancellation appears to be at the very least an act of self-censorship, which would add to a growing list of incidents of suppression of free expression in Hong Kong,"" Jason Y. Ng, president of PEN Hong Kong, said in a statement. ""It is all the more jarring that the decision was made by a publicly funded venue that claims to celebrate and support the arts and creativity."" It was not the first time a cultural institution in Hong Kong had altered its program because of concerns about politicization. In 2015, the title of an exhibition of contemporary Chinese art at M+, Hong Kong's publicly financed, long-planned ""museum of visual culture,"" was changed from the more challenging ""Right Is Wrong"" to the straightforward ""M+ Sigg Collection: Four Decades of Chinese Contemporary Art"" after museum committee members raised concerns. ""The problem in Hong Kong is not censorship,"" Pi Li, the Sigg senior curator at M+, said at the time. ""The problem in Hong Kong is self-censorship. It's self-censorship hidden in the procedures, so it's difficult to distinguish."""
News,2018-11-08,Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/business/dealbook/europe-bank-cop.html,411," Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Lenders shouldn't expect much help with their bad debts from Europe's new senior financial watchdog. The European Central Bank on Wednesday nominated Andrea Enria as chair of its supervisory board, which oversees the continent's 118 biggest lenders. Mr. Enria, from Italy, is currently the respected head of the European Banking Authority, and is unlikely to take a softer line on tackling lenders' bad debts. The industry's chronic low profitability and poor money-laundering controls present bigger challenges. Some might hope that his promotion would lead to softer treatment of Italian lenders, many of which are still grappling with bad debts. They are likely to be disappointed. Colleagues joke that Mr. Enria, a former Bank of Italy economist, is sufficiently northern that he may as well be Austrian. His orthodox credentials, and his experience of dealing with large, international financial institutions as chair of the European Banking Authority since 2011, helped him secure the nomination over Sharon Donnery, the deputy governor of Ireland's central bank. It's true that Mr. Enria has shown dovish impulses. In 2017 he called for the creation of a regional ""bad bank"" to help clean up dud loans. That would have implied a degree of risk sharing by European governments — anathema to Germany — and his plea fell on deaf ears. Since then, the E.C.B. has pushed banks to tackle their own problems. If confirmed, Mr. Enria will have bigger issues to tackle. First up are the European Union's lax money-laundering controls, which have led to the sudden closure of banks in Malta and Latvia this year. The scandal in which up to 200 billion euros of potentially suspicious funds flowed through Danske Bank's Estonian unit has cast a cloud over the Danish lender, and could yet infect others. But the E.C.B. has no formal anti-money laundering powers, instead relying on national authorities — or U.S. authorities — to take action. Then there is the thorny issue of low profitability. Inside the E.C.B., there is widespread dismay that, despite a benign economy and record-low bad debt charges, banks still can't make good profits. The European banking industry's average return on equity is 7.2 percent, according to European Banking Authority figures, well below a probable 10 percent cost of capital. Tackling these issues, rather than doing favors for banks in his home country, will be Mr. Enria's top priorities."
News,2018-11-09,"LOGAN, W.Va. — Richard Ojeda presented himself as a new face of the Democratic Party: a tough guy in combat boots whose economic populism was the key to flipping coal country and maybe — just maybe — a model for winning in rural America in the age of Donald J. Trump.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/west-virginia-midterm-election-richard-ojeda.html,1174," LOGAN, W.Va. — Richard Ojeda presented himself as a new face of the Democratic Party: a tough guy in combat boots whose economic populism was the key to flipping coal country and maybe — just maybe — a model for winning in rural America in the age of Donald J. Trump. For a moment, Mr. Ojeda seemed poised to pull it off. He channeled West Virginia's union roots when he championed a statewide teachers' strike earlier this year. He had a plain-speaking, almost Trump-like style that attracted attention and money, drawing more than $2 million in donations from around the country. But on Tuesday he lost badly, taking just two out of the 18 counties that make up the Third Congressional District, a swath in the southern coal fields that is home to Mr. Ojeda and many of the teachers he supported. He even lost his home county, Logan, by 24 points. ""I was absolutely slapped in the face when I saw the totals,"" said Heather Ritter, a school librarian and supporter of Mr. Ojeda, the day after the election. She added, ""I don't think people understand what's just happened and the gravity of this."" While the Democrats succeeded in winning back the House — and Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia managed to hang onto his seat — the magnitude of Mr. Ojeda's loss served as a stinging reminder to Democrats of the enduring power of Mr. Trump in rural parts of the country, particularly in Appalachia. Mr. Ojeda's supporters expected him to become a major force on the national stage, an important corrective to past mistakes when Democrats did not listen to working-class voters. Instead, he was dragged down by the undertow of nationalized politics — with Mr. Trump making many visits to West Virginia and supporting Mr. Ojeda's opponent, Carol Miller, whose main appeal to voters appeared to be her connection to the president. Antipathy toward Mr. Trump helped drive record turnout in some parts of the country, but many voters also came out to support the president. This was especially true in West Virginia, where more than 47 percent of the state's registered voters turned out on Tuesday — significantly more than in recent midterm years, according to the West Virginia secretary of state. In 51 interviews in five different towns in the district where Mr. Ojeda ran, a majority of voters said they turned out to defend the president. Dennis McCloud, a retired coal miner in the tiny town of Dingess, said he was voting for the first time in a midterm election. He said he had come to show support for Mr. Trump, who he said had been besieged by the news media and Democrats. ""If he says this cone is red, they'll say it's blue,"" said Mr. McCloud, 65, pointing to a traffic cone on the sidewalk as he stood outside an elementary school in Dingess, where he had just voted for Ms. Miller, a candidate he said he hadn't heard much about. ""I never felt this strongly about a president before,"" said Mr. McCloud, who was about to go celebrate his birthday — and his vote — with a steak. Social media also seems to have played a role in Mr. Ojeda's loss. Supporters point to a flurry of activity on Facebook with doctored photographs aimed at discrediting him. In one, Mr. Ojeda is sitting in a chair in front of his campaign sign smiling and holding cash like a fan. In another, a Facebook page called Veterans Against Richard Ojeda featured a picture of him altered to look like he was in makeup, pink fatigues and a pink beret. Matt Stanley, a school administrator who was staring in disbelief at the election results at Mr. Ojeda's election night party, said he saw them as a grim sign for the American political system. ""It's just disgusting that social media rules,"" he said. ""What he says they don't believe, but what they see on the computer, they do believe. Explain that to me. I can't wrap my head around it."" Of Ms. Miller, he said: ""She didn't show up to anything. She didn't have to."" Ms. Miller, a state delegate, was relatively unknown among voters and mostly avoided interviews and open public appearances during the campaign. Even the men sitting in lawn chairs behind a large sign that urged voters in Dingess to choose Ms. Miller were thin on details about their candidate. ""Don't know that much about her to be honest with you,"" said Hayden Hannah, 70, a retired timber worker, ""but she stands for Trump and that's enough for me."" One of Ms. Miller's campaign ads says she's a bison farmer who has supported legislation to make the Bible the official book of West Virginia. Her financial disclosure forms show her household controls a businesses that include real estate, car dealerships, and other investment assets worth $11 million. Ms. Miller did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Some voters said Mr. Ojeda had himself to blame for the poor showing. Carl Blevins, a retired coal miner in Chapmanville who said he did not like Mr. Trump and his style, said he also did not support Mr. Ojeda for some of the same reasons. ""He was his own worst enemy,"" Mr. Blevins said, sitting with a group of friends on Wednesday at Tudor's Biscuit World. ""There's an arrogance, like he knows more than the rest of us."" Mr. Trump made a number of trips to West Virginia to stump for Republicans, most recently last Friday. He has singled out Mr. Ojeda personally, calling him ""stone-cold crazy"" and ""a total wacko."" Mary Frances, a 78-year-old from Dingess, said she had come to vote for the sole purpose of supporting the president. She said she supported Ms. Miller, even though she did not know much about her. ""There are too many crooked politicians — one is about as good as the next one,"" she said. But Mr. Trump was different, she said, and he was protecting the country, including from the caravan of migrants, a large traveling group that moved from Central America into Mexico last month. ""If all those people come in here it will decimate this country,"" Ms. Frances said. On Tuesday night, Mr. Ojeda pledged to keep fighting, but also pondered whether it was even possible for a Democrat to win in West Virginia's Third Congressional District, which Mr. Trump won by nearly 50 points in 2016. ""Look, I really don't know what to say,"" he said. ""I'm not happy with the outcome, but I'm telling you right now, any place else in the United States of America we would have won. Anyplace else. We just happened to run in the reddest — and I hate to say this — an area where people just completely will fall for what we just had."" He added: ""We had a president who came down here and said 'Hey, I want you all to vote for her.' They didn't look and say, 'Why should we vote for her?'"""
News,2018-11-09,"LOS ANGELES — Disney returned to annual profit growth on Thursday after a difficult 2017, the result of blockbuster movies, rising theme park attendance and a stabilizing ESPN.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/business/media/disney-earnings-streaming-service.html,740," LOS ANGELES — Disney returned to annual profit growth on Thursday after a difficult 2017, the result of blockbuster movies, rising theme park attendance and a stabilizing ESPN. Despite reporting a record profit of $12.6 billion for its fiscal year, the Walt Disney Company spent most of a call with analysts discussing its high-risk plan to introduce a Netflix-style subscription streaming service late next year, which will carry enormous content, technology and marketing expenses. Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, unveiled the name of the streaming service on Thursday, telling analysts on a conference call that it would be called Disney Plus, styled by the company as Disney+. The name parallels the one for Disney's fledgling sports streaming service, ESPN Plus. In addition to the original shows and films already announced, Disney Plus will include a live-action ""Star Wars"" series based on the rebel spy Cassian Andor, a character from the 2016 film ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story."" Diego Luna will reprise the role, Mr. Iger said. Disney Plus will also feature a live-action Marvel series about Loki, the god of mischief from the ""Thor"" movies. Tom Hiddleston will reprise that role. Mr. Iger also gave an update on Disney's $71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox. European regulators approved the deal on Tuesday, which Mr. Iger called a ""major milestone."" Disney is still waiting for approval from a handful of countries, but Mr. Iger said he expected the deal to close ""meaningfully earlier"" than June, Disney's initial time frame. As for Sky, the British pay-television company that Disney lost to Comcast in a September bidding war, Mr. Iger said, ""You can't cry over spilled milk — nothing you can do about it."" He conceded that it would take Disney ""a little bit longer"" to roll out Disney Plus in Europe as a result. For the most recent quarter, the fourth in Disney's fiscal year, net income totaled $2.3 billion, a 33 percent increase from a year earlier. Profit for the year rose 40 percent. Analysts had expected far less growth for both the quarter and year. Although Disney ended its fiscal year on a high note, the coming quarter may be rough. Christine M. McCarthy, Disney's chief financial officer, cautioned that movie operating income could fall by as much as $600 million — or roughly 70 percent — because of comparisons to ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" in 2017. The lack of a ""Star Wars"" movie over the holidays will also hurt Disney's consumer products business. And programming costs at ESPN will climb because of the timing of sporting events. There were also areas of weakness in the quarter that just ended. Disney Consumer Products reported another drop in operating income — its fifth quarterly decline in a row — because of write-downs related to the Disney Store chain and worsening licensing results for the ""Cars"" franchise. Disney also disclosed that it had written off about 40 percent of its investment in the moribund Vice Media, or $157 million. And Disney turned to discounting to prop up attendance at Shanghai Disney Resort. ""We saw some softness in the tourism market in China,"" Mr. Iger said. ""Not just for us, but across the board."" He added that much of the discounting had ended. ""We still believe very, very, very bullishly"" in the resort, he said. Over all, however, it was a strong quarter for Disney, with each of its biggest divisions — movies, theme parks and television — contributing in a significant way to results, a contrast to a year ago, when movies and television sputtered. Movie operating income more than doubled, to $596 million, because of fewer film-related write-offs and scorching ticket sales for ""Incredibles 2"" and ""Ant-Man and the Wasp."" Disney's theme parks had operating income of $829 million, an 11 percent increase, because of growth at Walt Disney World in Florida, which suffered from Hurricane Irma in 2017. And quarterly profit at Disney's vast television business, which includes ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel and the Freeform network, climbed 9 percent, to $5.96 billion. Results at ESPN were flat; higher subscription fees were offset by a decline in advertising. Lower costs helped Disney Channels Worldwide and Freeform deliver improved results. ABC benefited from sales of reruns for the sitcom ""black-ish,"" but continued to suffer from declining ratings: Increases in political ad revenue were offset by ""lower network impressions."" Disney shares climbed about 1.7 percent in aftermarket trading, to $118."
News,2018-11-09,"WASHINGTON — Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, served on the advisory board of a Florida company that a federal judge shut down last year and fined nearly $26 million after the government accused it of scamming customers.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/politics/whitaker-trump-attorney-general.html,1317," WASHINGTON — Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, served on the advisory board of a Florida company that a federal judge shut down last year and fined nearly $26 million after the government accused it of scamming customers. The company, World Patent Marketing, ""bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars"" by promising inventors lucrative patent agreements, according to a complaint filed in Florida by the Federal Trade Commission. Court documents show that when frustrated consumers tried to get their money back, Scott J. Cooper, the company's president and founder, used Mr. Whitaker to threaten them as a former federal prosecutor. Mr. Cooper's company paid Mr. Whitaker nearly $10,000 before it closed. Mr. Whitaker's role in the company would complicate his confirmation prospects should President Trump nominate him as attorney general. It is not clear if Mr. Trump was aware of Mr. Whitaker's involvement with the patent marketing company before naming him as a replacement for Jeff Sessions, who was ousted by Mr. Trump on Wednesday. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Whitaker's ties to the patent company, which were first reported by The Miami New Times. Before his ascension to the office of the nation's top law enforcement official, Mr. Whitaker, 49, was Mr. Sessions's chief of staff. A conservative Republican from Iowa, he was seen within the Justice Department as a White House loyalist who publicly expressed doubts about the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Mr. Trump or any of his associates conspired in the effort. Mr. Whitaker's appointment has prompted concerns that he might shut down or stymie the special counsel's investigation. In August 2017, Mr. Whitaker highlighted on Twitter a Philly.com opinion article with the headline ""Note to Trump's Lawyer: Do Not Cooperate With Mueller Lynch Mob."" In his tweet, Mr. Whitaker wrote that it was ""worth a read."" Mr. Whitaker also wrote an opinion article that same day for CNN's website with the headline ""Mueller's Investigation of Trump Is Going Too Far."" He said the investigation needed to be limited. Mr. Whitaker, a former college football player, joined the Justice Department in October 2017 after Mr. Trump watched him as a CNN analyst and approved of his television appearances. World Patent Marketing was founded in 2014 and had the hallmarks of a legitimate business. It used a splashy website and other marketing materials to ""create the impression that they have successfully helped other inventors,"" the trade commission said in its complaint. In reality, the commission said, the Miami Beach company failed to make good on almost every promise it made to consumers, and strung them along for months or years after taking their money. When prospective customers left their contact information on the company website, an employee would call them back and follow a script: The company was an ""invention powerhouse"" with an ""incredible advisory board,"" including Mr. Whitaker, a ""former United States attorney who was appointed by President George Bush."" Mr. Whitaker had served as the top prosecutor for the Southern District of Iowa, a position he held until 2009. In joining the board, Mr. Whitaker was quoted in a news release issued by the company as saying that he was honored to be a part of World Patent Marketing because it was a ""trusted partner to many inventors."" In another news release, Mr. Whitaker was quoted as saying that ""as a former U.S. attorney, I would only align myself with a first-class organization."" ""World Patent Marketing,"" the release continued, ""goes beyond making statements about doing business 'ethically' and translates those words into action."" In footage uploaded to Vimeo, a video platform, in 2015, Mr. Whitaker can be seen reviewing an invention meant to reduce razor-blade cuts. Mr. Cooper also posted a picture of himself on social media with a smiling Mr. Whitaker at the company offices in Miami. The trade commission complaint said that consumers were told they had to spend about $3,000 for a ""Global Invention Royalty Analysis"" to begin the process of examining an invention with the goal of getting a patent. After making the payment, the company's clients were then pitched various packages ranging from approximately $8,000 to about $65,000. After the company took the money, it typically began ignoring customers, who became frustrated that they were left in the dark. Mr. Cooper would often berate or threaten them when they asked questions or wanted their money back. ""Defendants and their lawyers have threatened consumers with lawsuits and even criminal charges and imprisonment for making any kind of complaint,"" the trade commission's complaint said. In at least two instances, Mr. Cooper used Mr. Whitaker's former position as a federal prosecutor to rebuff customers. Mr. Whitaker, using his Iowa law firm's email, told a man who had complained to Mr. Cooper that he was a former federal prosecutor and served on the company's board. ""Your emails and message from today seem to be an apparent attempt at possible blackmail or extortion,"" Mr. Whitaker wrote in August 2015. ""You also mentioned filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and to smear World Patent Marketing's reputation online. I am assuming you understand that there could be serious civil and criminal consequences for you."" When another frustrated customer, Rich O'Neill of Montana, emailed around the same time and wanted his $1,300 returned, Mr. Cooper fired back a threatening email. ""You're telling me that if I don't refund your $1,300, you will blackmail me into filing complaints with regulators? And you just put it in writing,"" Mr. Cooper wrote. ""You are aware that we have a former U.S. attorney on our board."" Mr. Cooper returned the money to Mr. O'Neill, who said in an interview on Thursday that he believed the email referencing Mr. Whitaker was meant to intimidate him. The complaint also accused the company of using thuggish tactics, according to court documents. In an email to customers, the company referenced a blog post that described how one person wanted to speak with Mr. Cooper about his invention idea. The post said that the person was intercepted by the company's ""intimidating security team, all ex-Israeli special ops and trained in Krav Maga, one of the most deadly of the martial arts."" The post added, ""The World Patent Marketing Security Team are the kind of guys who are trained to knock out first and ask questions later."" Another customer, Brenda Wilcox, 49, a Trump supporter who lives in Broward County, Fla., said in an interview on Thursday that World Patent Marketing scammed $11,000 from her. She said the company had agreed to market, license and develop a bracelet she invented that would warn drivers if they left a baby in the back seat of their car. Another customer, William Knecht of Texas, lost about $35,000 on a patent package, according to the complaint. ""The entire time I worked with W.P.M. I feel like the company cut corners, did the bare minimum to get by, and were just slimy enough to keep me happy and not complaining,"" Mr. Knecht said in a 2017 statement as part of the trade commission's case. Another customer, Christopher Seaver, a Florida doctor who spent more than $300,000 hoping to make money on an invention, said that Mr. Cooper asked him to be on the advisory board to do consulting work on medical patents. ""I have not made any money from my involvement with W.P.M.,"" Dr. Seaver said in the complaint. ""This has caused financial hardship for me because I paid life savings to W.P.M."" He added, ""I've gotten nothing in return."" This past March, the federal judge, Darrin P. Gayles, banned Mr. Cooper and World Patent Marketing from the invention promotion industry. Mr. Cooper was also ordered to pay the trade commission nearly $1 million, according to court documents. His lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday."
News,2018-11-09,"LANSING, Mich. — There is a tendency for people to define Gretchen Whitmer by who she is not.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/politics/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-governor.html,1642," LANSING, Mich. — There is a tendency for people to define Gretchen Whitmer by who she is not. Ms. Whitmer was not one of the surprising, insurgent Democratic nominees for governor this cycle, as her campaign for Michigan's governorship was flush with money and key endorsements from the outset. She did not have the up-from-nothing background story of some other Democratic candidates; after all, a building in downtown Detroit is named for her father, the former chief executive of Blue Cross Blue Shield. She was not Abdul El-Sayed, the fiery leftist whose campaign for governor captured national attention, but who lost badly to Ms. Whitmer in the primary. And she was not Hillary Clinton, whose 2016 failure in Michigan still reverberates among Democrats throughout the state. But after a nearly 10-point victory Tuesday over the Republican state attorney general, Bill Schuette, Ms. Whitmer is finally getting recognition for who she is: a shrewd politician tailor-made for Michigan, whose pragmatic approach to policymaking has consistently been underrated by opponents in both parties. In the weeks leading up to the election, a slate of new Democratic stars emerged who gained national attention: Andrew Gillum in Florida, Beto O'Rourke in Texas, Stacey Abrams in Georgia. None won on Tuesday — Mr. Gillum's and Ms. Abrams's races have not yet been called — while the Whitmer-led ticket in Michigan soared, flipping two House seats and electing women to key statewide posts. ""The Biggest Democratic Stars Of The Midterms Lost. Here's Who You Should Know About Now,"" read one headline on election night that featured Ms. Whitmer's picture. Ms. Whitmer, 47, has also united a Michigan Democratic Party that was wounded and embarrassed after President Trump's 2016 victory in the state. She buried the pervasive belief that a ticket led by a woman could not succeed in the industrial Midwest, winning over a once-skeptical Detroit community and even some voters who backed Mr. Trump. That's partly because she's the anti-Clinton, said Lon Johnson, former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party. ""I think that Hillary was viewed as a part of the hyper partisanship of this country, and Gretchen is not,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""She's rightly viewed as someone who's reasoned and effective and doesn't join the shouting.'' Ms. Whitmer's folksy appeal was evident during the campaign as she traversed Michigan, an ideologically diverse state that is still rebounding from a recession that considerably damaged its labor-heavy economy. Ms. Whitmer, the former state Democratic Senate leader, leaned on her statehouse connections early in the race. She also diverged from the traditional Democratic formula for the primary — consolidating support in the outer areas of the state before focusing on Detroit later in the cycle. Fueled by her ""Fix the Damn Roads"" bus tour and the belief that Democrats have not adequately reached out to working-class people of all races, Ms. Whitmer visited all 83 Michigan counties: union voters in Macomb County who voted for Mr. Trump, Flint residents still wrestling with the continuing water crisis and teacher unions hobbled by a Republican administration hostile to labor. ""Love you, Gretchen!"" one man called as she headed toward a diner in Lansing, her hometown, a common occurrence for a person who seems to be on a first-name basis with many voters. ""Gretchen is like a football team that just runs the ball and runs the ball and runs the ball,"" said Mark Bernstein, the powerful Democrat and a member of the Board of Regents at the University of Michigan. Ms. Whitmer, a big sports fan who went to college with hopes of being a sideline broadcaster, would appreciate the reference. ""Lots of times people want to see like 30-yard passes or fancy stunt play, but that's just not her style,"" he said. ""This is Michigan, where we respect candidates who campaign how they live and work — and she does that."" Ms. Whitmer described her approach as being ""tethered to the things that matter to people."" ""Part of the failures of past Democratic campaigns, I believe, was in not showing up,"" she said. ""In assuming that you know what people are confronting and what they need and what they expect."" Last month in her Lansing campaign office, Ms. Whitmer outlined some of the defining contours of her life in public service. She credited her parents, a Michigan power couple who worked in state government, with instilling in her a desire to give back to others. She also cited two life-changing experiences as the motivating forces behind her pragmatic approach to policymaking: caring for her dying mother in the early 2000s while she was nursing her first child and being sexually assaulted in college. Ms. Whitmer described the sexual assault in an emotional speech on the floor of the State Senate in 2013, when she opposed the so-called rape insurance bill, which banned insurance coverage for abortion in private health plans unless women purchased a separate rider. The bill passed over her objections, but she views it as an example of how her values inform her political decisions. ""I've come to appreciate that these experiences are what compels me to just come in and fix problems,"" she said. ""It eliminates my patience for anyone who wants to politicize an issue instead of just rolling up their sleeves and getting to work."" Republicans struggled to find a consistent line of attack against Ms. Whitmer. Mr. Schuette, who heavily spent his own money in the governor's race, tried to tie Ms. Whitmer to the tenure of former Gov. Jennifer Granholm, whose administration struggled with a slumping economy and the financial collapse of Detroit during her two terms. Mr. Schuette even called Ms. Whitmer by Ms. Granholm's name in a recent debate, though he quickly corrected himself. ""Maybe Bill Schuette will finally learn my name,"" Ms. Whitmer said at a campaign stop on Election Day. The most lasting criticism of Ms. Whitmer came from Mr. El-Sayed, her primary opponent who later endorsed her. In a recent interview, Mr. El-Sayed said ""it's no secret"" that his definition of a progressive differs from Ms. Whitmer's. He also said Ms. Whitmer's establishment ties significantly helped her in the primary. ""I think she was really effective at being able to leverage her influence with insiders in the party to keep other people out of the race"" who would have eaten into her vote, he said. ""She was up against it. And a lot of folks were worried about what her candidacy would mean."" Mr. El-Sayed consistently chided Ms. Whitmer on health care. Though Ms. Whitmer was integral in helping Michigan expand Medicaid in 2013, she refused to back the Medicare-for-all proposal that Mr. El-Sayed and other progressive stalwarts attributed to her close connection with the health care industry and companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield. Ms. Whitmer bristles at the establishment label and said she simply refused to overpromise things to voters she did not feel the current system can deliver. ""You can be both progressive and want to get things done — they're not mutually exclusive and that's what I bring,"" she said. The establishment label sticks particularly well to Ms. Whitmer, a product of a powerhouse Michigan family. Her mother, Sherry, was a Democrat and a top lawyer in the attorney general's office. Richard Whitmer, her father, led the state Department of Commerce in a Republican administration before leading Blue Cross Blue Shield as C.E.O. for years. The eldest of three children, Ms. Whitmer had dreams of covering sports for ESPN or a local television station that were upended after she took an internship with a local representative in Lansing, she said. She then decided to forgo broadcasting and enter Michigan State's law school, igniting a political awakening that coincided with her parents' rise to prominence in statehouse politics. She won her first primary election for the State House of Representatives less than three years after graduating from law school, kick-starting her political ascent that culminated with her becoming the first woman to lead a party caucus in Michigan's Senate. Republicans have criticized Ms. Whitmer for being a lifelong politician and failing to sponsor significant legislation while in the statehouse. They have also said that in her next job after leaving the legislature, as Ingham County prosecutor, she failed to aggressively investigate Lawrence G. Nassar, the former Michigan State gymnastics doctor who was later convicted of charges of sexual molestation and child pornography. Ms. Whitmer has said she pursued the necessary charges based on the information she was given at the time, and the Nassar case was eventually taken out of her jurisdiction. She also notes that she made several reforms to the prosecutor's office in her six-month tenure, including opening a unit dedicated to investigating domestic violence. Political experts in Michigan point to the Medicaid expansion as a defining moment for her bipartisan credentials. Some Democrats in 2013 were torn about whether to work with the Republican governor, Rick Snyder, such a key legislative accomplishment, but Ms. Whitmer gained fans throughout the state for her willingness to put policy over politics. Debbie Stabenow, the Michigan senator who won re-election Tuesday, credits Ms. Whitmer for helping women secure victories across the ticket. Ms. Stabenow said it was especially important to do so by emphasizing their job qualifications, not their gender. ""Sooner or later in American history this moment was going to come, where women were stepping forward and being recognized as the most qualified candidate,"" Ms. Stabenow said, as Aretha Franklin's ""R-E-S-P-E-C-T"" blared from Ms. Whitmer's campaign bus on Tuesday. ""And that didn't happen because we were in a back room and planned this together, but because each of us ran on our own merits."" The next song in the queue was Ms. Whitmer's favorite: Lizzo's women's empowerment anthem, ""Good as Hell."" ""Boss up and change your life,"" the future governor sang. ""You can have it all, no sacrifice."""

Another mass shooting in the U.S., a century since the Armistice, and how the Mandarin duck got its name.  Here's the latest: • A mass shooting in California. Investigators were searching for clues to why a former Marine armed with a .45-caliber handgun, legally obtained, opened fire at a crowded dance hall in Thousand Oaks, Calif., on Wednesday night, killing 12 people. He was identified as Ian D. Long, 28, a combat veteran. He had served in Afghanistan and was later evaluated for post-traumatic stress. But the authorities said they had determined that he posed no threat. He died after being confronted by police officers, including one who became his victim, Sgt. Ron Helus. Sergeant Helus was honored Thursday in the procession seen above. Some of the hundreds of the people in the club had survived the mass shooting at a country music festival last year in Las Vegas, where 58 people were killed. _____ • 100 years after the Armistice.  Dozens of world leaders will commemorate the end of World War I in France this weekend, and President Emmanuel Macron, above, hopes the occasion puts them in mind of the dangers of nationalism. But as he gets ready to inherit de facto leadership of the E.U. from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Mr. Macron is a diminished figure. On the world stage, he has few allies in defending immigration and liberal governance. In Europe, he is despised by rising populist movements. At home, his policies and aristocratic image are putting people off. Mr. Macron recently likened this era to the one between the world wars. Analysts told us he'll have to do a better job of grappling with discontent if he hopes to change the Continent's course. _____ • Another jam-packed day in American politics.  To justify the White House's unusual move of barring the CNN reporter Jim Acosta, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders falsely claimed he had laid hands on a staff member, above right, during a contentious presidential news conference. Ms. Sanders circulated misleadingly edited video of the encounter that came from an infamous conspiracy website. Meanwhile, the Trump administration claimed vast authority to deny asylum to virtually any migrant who crosses the border illegally. And there were new details about the acting attorney general, Mark Whitaker, a skeptic of the Russia investigation who is now tasked with overseeing it. He was on the advisory board of a company accused of bilking customers and has criticized the Supreme Court's power of judicial review, a foundational principle of American government. _____ • What brought down Lion Air Flight 610? We've had reporters around the world consulting investigators, pilots and aviation experts, trying to understand what may have caused a new Boeing jet to crash into the Java Sea last week, at the cost of 189 lives. What they've been able to reconstruct is an end that would have been terrifying but swift. The single-aisle Boeing aircraft appears to have plummeted nose-first at as much as 400 m.p.h., striking the waves in less than a minute. And it's become clear that there might have been a whole cascade of problems — including erroneous data, a burst of confusing alarms in the cockpit and the culture at Lion Air, an Indonesian airline. _____ • Google overhauls its sexual misconduct policy. The technology giant said it would end forced arbitration for sexual harassment or assault claims, days after more than 20,000 of its employees around the world, prompted by a Times investigation, walked out in protest of how the company handles cases of sexual misconduct.

Our critic reviewed the results. Recently, a visitor has been seen paddling around in a lake in New York's Central Park: a brightly colored little duck. The duck, above, a native to East Asia that quickly became a star on social media, is a yuānyang (鸳鸯) in China. In English, it's a Mandarin duck. Why? The fowl's vibrant plumage recalls the dress of government bureaucrats centuries ago, called mandarins in the West. The same connection applied to the dialect those officials used. Even mandarin oranges got the linguistic overlay. But mandarin is not a Chinese word. Its etymology is disputed. Some say that during the Qing dynasty, visiting Westerners heard people calling government officials of the ruling class ""mǎn dàrén"" (满大人): Manchu for ""big man"" or ""boss."" Others say that the term comes from ""menteri,"" the Malay for ""court councilor"" or ""minister,"" and that the 16th-century Portuguese who used Malaysia as a stepping stone into China wrote it as ""mandarin."" The little duck in Central Park has been solo, but in China, its cousins are believed to be lifelong couples. There is a saying: A pair of Mandarin ducks is more enviable than an immortal.

News,2018-11-09,"MANILA — A Philippine court on Friday sentenced Imelda R. Marcos, the country’s flamboyant former first lady, to a minimum of 42 years in prison for creating private foundations to hide her unexplained wealth.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/world/asia/imelda-marcos-sentenced-philippines.html,720," MANILA — A Philippine court on Friday sentenced Imelda R. Marcos, the country's flamboyant former first lady, to a minimum of 42 years in prison for creating private foundations to hide her unexplained wealth. But it is unlikely that Ms. Marcos, a 89-year-old widow, will see any jail time. The court, which handles graft and public corruption cases, said the ruling could be appealed, and legal experts have said Ms. Marcos could fight a prison sentence because of her advanced age. The sentence comes as Mrs. Marcos and her family have seen a political resurgence in the Philippines, having gained favor under the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte. The court found her guilty of seven counts of graft, with each count punishable by a minimum of six years in prison. The ruling also automatically disqualifies Mrs. Marcos, who is a congresswoman, from holding any public office. Mrs. Marcos did not appear in court for the sentencing, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. In a statement later Friday, Mrs. Marcos said her lawyer was studying the ruling and intended to file a motion asking the court to reconsider it. The lengthy sentence drew praise from some leading opponents of Mr. Duterte, who has in the past praised the brutal dictatorship of Mrs. Marcos's deceased husband, Ferdinand Marcos. Loretta Ann Rosales, the country's former human rights commissioner, who was tortured as an activist in the 1970s for opposing Mr. Marcos, called the sentence a symbolic victory for the thousands who died resisting the dictatorship. ""I am literally jumping with joy,"" Ms. Rosales said in an interview. She said the ruling showed that there were still public corruption judges ""who have helped keep the candles lit through these dark nights and pursued the truth."" She said the ruling also proved that the Marcoses and their cronies were guilty of raiding government coffers in order to enjoy a lavish lifestyle while millions of Filipinos lived in poverty. Neither Mrs. Marcos nor her lawyers could immediately be reached for comment. The charges against Mrs. Marcos took more than a quarter-century to prosecute, largely because many people who could have been witnesses had died or were too old to testify. The charges were filed in 1991, when state prosecutors accused Mrs. Marcos of creating private foundations in Switzerland and having financial interests in several companies when she was governor of Manila between 1978 and 1984. Prosecutors said the fake firms hid money that her family stole from the government. The prosecutors wrapped up their presentation in 2015, but Mrs. Marcos's lawyers successfully delayed the hearings by not appearing in court. Among those who testified against Mrs. Marcos was Frank Chaves, the country's late solicitor general, who filed a sworn statement that said Mrs. Marcos had used the foundations in Switzerland to hide millions of dollars of stolen wealth. The government successfully recovered some $658 million that the Marcoses held in Swiss financial institutions. But officials believe that is just a fraction of the roughly $10 billion they say the Marcoses stole from the Philippines. Ferdinand Marcos's two-decade rule was ended by the 1986 ""people power"" revolution. The Marcoses were sent into exile in Hawaii, where Mr. Marcos died three years later. The family was subsequently allowed to return home, where they re-established a base in their hometown, Ilocos Norte, in the northern Philippines. The Marcoses' political fortunes surged after Mr. Duterte was elected president two years ago. Mr. Duterte, who often describes himself as a fan of the late dictator, has credited the Marcos family with consolidating support for him in the north. In 2016, he allowed Mr. Marcos's remains to be reburied in a heroes' cemetery in Manila, leading toprotests. Mr. Duterte has also backed Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s appeal of his narrow loss in the vice-presidential election that year. A spokesman for Mr. Duterte, Salvador Panelo, said Friday that the president respected the court's decision. ""While we note that there are still legal remedies available to Congresswoman Marcos, this latest development underscores that our country currently has a working and impartial justice system that favors no one,"" Mr. Panelo said. One of the Marcoses' daughters, Imee Marcos, is running next year for the Philippine Senate. She recently refused demands by rights groups that she apologize for her father's atrocities, calling on the public to ""move on."""
News,2018-11-09,"MANCHESTER, England — The problem with Manchester City, as Arsène Wenger saw it, was not simply that it possessed an apparently bottomless well of wealth. It was that City was smart, too. “Petrol and ideas,” as Wenger, the former Arsenal manager, put it. “Money and quality.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/sports/manchester-city-united-football-leaks.html,1780," MANCHESTER, England — The problem with Manchester City, as Arsène Wenger saw it, was not simply that it possessed an apparently bottomless well of wealth. It was that City was smart, too. ""Petrol and ideas,"" as Wenger, the former Arsenal manager, put it. ""Money and quality."" Wenger, of course, spent much of his career railing against soccer's inexorable drift into the grasp of oligarchs and plutocrats, vainly espousing the virtues of sustainability as the game swooned before leveraged billionaires and sovereign investment funds. It was Wenger who first introduced the idea of ""financial doping"" to the sport, preaching parsimony during a gold rush. By the end, though, even he did not believe City's success could be explained solely by its balance sheet. Its pre-eminence could not have been achieved without the billion-plus pounds provided by its backer, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, but it would not have been so complete had that money not been spent so wisely. The most obvious manifestation of that has been on the field: Pep Guardiola's team won the Premier League last season with more points and more goals than any team in the modern era. It did so with such style, such ruthless élan that England as a whole will ""forever be grateful"" for Guardiola's presence, as the former striker Gary Lineker put it. When England's national team reached the semifinals of the World Cup last summer, many credited Guardiola, at least in part, for helping to smooth the introduction of a more modern approach. Off the field, though, the modern City has also become a point of reference to many. City Football Group, the umbrella organization that owns City and its interlinked network of sister clubs, has been consulted by the Chinese Super League on how to run its teams more sustainably. In the United States, in particular, Major League Soccer has made use of the vast database of information held by City's recruitment department when assessing potential signings from minor European leagues. Even Real Madrid, a club more accustomed to leading than following, was impressed by City's model. Executives from the Santiago Bernabéu told City's chief executive, Ferran Soriano, that it was not something they could copy — Real's prestige would be diluted by franchising, they felt — but they admired the concept. Like everyone else in soccer, they accepted that City was about more than just oil: it had ideas, too. Increasingly, it seems as though that combination is simply too much for the rest of the Premier League. Guardiola's team has dropped only four points this season; it remains on course to equal, or beat, its points total from last year. It will go into Sunday's derby against Manchester United as a firm favorite; United, for so long the shadow City could not escape, now seems the underdog. On Tuesday, Guardiola was asked if the league as a whole would eventually suffer for City's unimpeachable excellence. ""I don't know,"" he said, ""if it's a problem."" Similar success in the Champions League, the competition its executives — if not its fans — cherish more than any other, has proved more elusive. City does not need the trophy, though, to know that it has already joined Europe's front rank of teams. In the documents released by the opaque whistle-blowing platform Football Leaks to the German magazine Der Spiegel, five Premier League clubs were named as party to a plan to launch a breakaway European Super League — replacing the Champions League — starting in 2021. City was among them. The petrol, and the ideas, have brought City to the head table. Those documents, though, have painted an entirely different picture of City from the one that had convinced so many of its opponents to follow its example. In a weeklong exposé of the methods the club has used to circumvent UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations — to, in a comment attributed to Simon Pearce, one of the club's most influential executives, ""do what we want"" — Der Spiegel and Football Leaks have depicted a club that has, for almost a decade, worked tirelessly to deceive and co-opt the game's authorities, to make sure the rules do not apply to City; and whenever it has not gotten its way, it has reacted with petulant anger. There are details of inflated sponsorship deals designed to mask covert cash injections from the club's owners; of closed payment loops with spurious third-party companies for players' image rights; of a former manager's salary that seems, at least in part, to have been bolstered by an ""advisory"" role with another club owned by Sheikh Mansour; of a secret partnership with a Danish team that may have breached rules on a club's influence; of legal threats toward not only UEFA but to the accounting firm sent in to examine the club's accounts; and of back-room deals with Gianni Infantino, at the time the general secretary of UEFA and now the most powerful man at FIFA. Nobody comes out of the revelations well: not Infantino, craven and crawling; not UEFA, willing to prosecute the minnows while the sharks swim free; not the clubs, led by Bayern Munich, who talked of leaving not only UEFA but FIFA itself in search of more money; not Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, who has called for those guilty of ""dirty tricks"" to be punished, which would coincidentally help several of the teams in his competition; not the clubs or organizations who should be righteously angry at flagrant rule breaches but who have maintained the silence of the complicit; and certainly not City — or, for that matter, Paris Saint-Germain — who signed up to a set of rules and promptly searched for ways to break them. The New York Times has not seen the source documents Der Spiegel has obtained, and cannot verify them. But City has not declared any of the information reported so far to be false. It has simply dismissed the documents as a ""clear and organized attempt"" to smear the club's reputation. It might also point out, of course, that it has already been punished for failing to comply with Financial Fair Play — 60 million euros (about $68 million) in 2014, though some of it was suspended or subsequently refunded — even if, as the documents show, intensive lobbying meant that fine was substantially lighter than it might have been. The documents suggest City is likely to believe that relief was justified, too. The club has hardly made a secret of the fact it felt Financial Fair Play was a ruse concocted by the game's traditional elite to keep upstarts like City and P.S.G. in their place. If City was trying to find a way around the rules, it was only because the rules were unfair. Besides, even if the allegations are true, and tens or hundreds of millions of dollars more were injected into City than the club's accounts recorded, that does not change the fundamental truth, the one even Wenger recognized: That money alone is not enough. That, certainly, is Guardiola's view. ""When I was at Barcelona and in Germany, always I heard that Manchester City just has money,"" he said this week. ""You have to accept it when people say you win just because of money. We believe that we work a lot: not just the manager, the staff and the players. If people say it is about money, we accept it, but that point of view is completely wrong. We work a lot, in a good way, and that is why I always defend us."" City, in other words, has petrol and ideas. There is, though, a broader issue here, one that stretches beyond whether City has been punished enough, or whether F.F.P. was well-conceived in the first place. To zoom in on those issues is to get lost in the weeds. Even as City — like P.S.G. — reportedly poured considerable time, effort and expense into breaking UEFA's regulations, it was simultaneously meeting any threat of a punishment with ire and anger, contemplating whether any potential fine might be better spent on a legal team to take on, and crush, the organization levying it. When the sum it would be forced to pay was eventually decided, City could afford to declare that tens of millions of euros did not ""materially affect"" its business. That is the true image cast by the revelations of the last week, one that has ramifications far beyond tribal self-interest: of not just one club, but of a whole host of them that believe the rules should be altered to fit their needs; of teams so inflated by success that they can now casually disregard the diktats of their governing bodies; of teams too big to fail, beyond control. That is what led City both to deceive and then disdain UEFA. It is what led to the endless changes to the Champions League and the tweaks to domestic cup competitions and a series of bans for illegally approaching, or signing, young players: an essential arrogance, a disregard for consequence, a belief that might makes right. It is what threatens the fundamental rupture in the fabric of the game best reflected in that Bayern-concocted plot for a breakaway super league that would involve pulling players out of all international soccer, including the World Cup. Perhaps it is understandable that City tried to circumvent a set of rules designed, to a large extent, specifically to protect the teams it was trying to usurp. Perhaps it was justified in fighting, tooth and nail, the idea that it might be punished by what it considers a rigged system. Perhaps UEFA got lucky that it did not go to court. Perhaps, too, it would be evidence of a skewed morality to condemn City's owners for all of that but not for the allegations of human rights abuses and oppression they have overseen in the United Arab Emirates. But to turn a blind eye to that, as the game's authorities seem likely to do, is to help yet again usher in a game with one rule for the rich and another for the poor; a game of governing bodies that cower at the trembling fist of the great and the good; a game of teams who decide which rules suit them, and when, and of authorities who act at the behest of their most powerful subjects and fans that contort themselves to praise actions that might otherwise draw scorn. It is to embrace a game that is not being run in the interests of the many, but the few, and a world where the quality of an idea is no match for a quantity of petrol."
News,2018-11-09,Do you or your family know anyone who is homeless? How big a problem is homelessness in your neighborhood or community?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/learning/would-you-let-a-homeless-person-live-in-your-backyard.html,599," Do you or your family know anyone who is homeless? How big a problem is homelessness in your neighborhood or community? In ""A Novel Solution for the Homeless: House Them in Backyards,"" Jennifer Medina explores a bold new pilot program in Los Angeles to offer incentives to homeowners to provide shelter to the homeless in their backyards: Faced with a major housing crisis, Los Angeles is trying out an idea that some hope is so wild it just might work: helping homeowners build small homes in their backyards and rent them to people who have spent months living in their cars, in shelters or on the streets. Both the county and the city of Los Angeles are beginning pilot programs to give homeowners subsidies to create housing for the homeless. Similar experiments are also underway in Seattle and Portland. Though housing the homeless in your backyard might be considered extreme, thousands of residents on the West Coast have indicated they are interested in doing just that. ""It's part of our daily life now — you're always either walking or driving past someone who is homeless,"" said Ms. Chavarria, a 37-year-old single mother who works in human resources. She has volunteered at soup kitchens and contributed to food drives but more often has felt helpless about the seemingly intractable problem. ""If we can be part of doing something, why would I not want to do that?"" she said. ""I'm not religious, but I am spiritual, and I have this belief that when God blesses you, it's to bless someone else."" While officials hope that homeowners like Ms. Chavarria will be motivated by good will, they also plan to prod them by offering subsidies. A pilot program run by Los Angeles County will give assistance to a handful of homeowners who are willing to build. Ms. Chavarria was one of more than 500 homeowners who applied for the program. Once the unit she is building is rented, she expects to earn $1,500 a month, paid for through a Section 8 voucher or some other rental assistance program. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — Would you let a homeless person live in your backyard? Why or why not? — What responsibility do we all have to others who are facing difficult situations — in this case, people who do not have a home? Melina Chavarria, one of the homeowners participating in the pilot, said, ""If we can be part of doing something, why would I not want to do that?"" She continued, ""I'm not religious, but I am spiritual, and I have this belief that when God blesses you, it's to bless someone else."" Do you find her reasons persuasive? — While the central goal of the program is to provide a home for someone who does not have one, do you think participants might get additional benefits — beyond financial incentives — by housing someone else in their backyard? What might some of these benefits be? — What does your community do to help alleviate the issue of homelessness? Do you think these actions are effective? Why or why not? — How effective do you think this pilot program will be? What might it be able to accomplish that traditional approaches might not? — Currently, the pilot is in Los Angeles, with similar experiments in Seattle and Portland. Should all cities adopt this novel approach? Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public."
News,2018-11-09,The United States has been engaged in land wars in the Middle East for so long that it’s easy to forget some of our nation’s most significant battles have been fought at sea. Two good new books remind us of the importance of maritime warfare in our national history.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/books/review/nathaniel-philbrick-in-the-hurricanes-eye.html,2322," The United States has been engaged in land wars in the Middle East for so long that it's easy to forget some of our nation's most significant battles have been fought at sea. Two good new books remind us of the importance of maritime warfare in our national history. Nathaniel Philbrick demonstrates once again with IN THE HURRICANE'S EYE: The Genius of George Washington and the Victory at Yorktown (Viking, $30) that he is a masterly storyteller. Here he seeks to elevate the naval battles between the French and British to a central place in the history of the American Revolution. He succeeds, marvelously. He can relate in a word or two what others might take a chapter to expound. For example, his phrase ""Washington's tightly coiled response"" captures the tense tone of much of Washington's wartime correspondence. Nor is Philbrick afraid to make sweeping assertions. He writes that ""the bitter truth was that by the summer of 1781 the American Revolution had failed,"" in that it was a stalemate that many Americans no longer supported physically or financially. Victory would be secured, he continues, not by Americans but by French funds, guns, ships and soldiers. (Philbrick also does hurricanes well.) On top of that, at a time when many books of military history have poor maps or none, this book has many, all of them instructive and graceful. As a writer, I'm envious of Philbrick's talents, but as a reader, I'm grateful. Trent Hone's LEARNING WAR: The Evolution of Fighting Doctrine in the U.S. Navy, 1898-1945 (Naval Institute, $34.95) is quite the opposite, a dry volume written for military professionals. But there is a place for such works, especially when they show how organizational change can be the key to victory. Hone examines the United States Navy of World War II through his lens as a management consultant. Sample: ""The Pacific Fleet would not advance as a monolith; it would attack as a distributed network."" Personalities do not loom large in his tale. The real hero here is not an individual but a large, complex organization, the American Navy, that quickly grew from second-rate status to become the world's premier maritime force. Even so, Hone tells the story of the 1942-43 Guadalcanal campaign particularly well. That history is often related from the Marine Corps's point of view, which in painful summary is that the Navy ran away and left the Marines to fight it out alone against the Japanese. As Hone tells it, Navy commanders knew they were outmatched by the Japanese but also recognized that Guadalcanal was a decisive campaign of the Pacific War. Understanding those stakes, they engaged in suicidal missions in an effort to keep the Japanese Navy from bombarding the Marine airfield on the island and also from landing reinforcements. But the most intriguing chapter is Hone's study of a critical but largely unrecognized reorganization that transformed Navy operations beginning in late 1942. The problem was that commanders of warships were being cognitively overwhelmed by all the new information thrown at them in battle. In addition to traditional sightings and signaling, they were now receiving reports by radio from aircraft and from other ships, as well as from radar readings. The Navy's answer was to design a new Combat Information Center on each ship. Through it, all that data could be continually funneled, sifted, integrated and passed to the captain and others on the vessel who might need it, like gunners. Such an improvement may seem mere common sense, but then many great innovations do seem obvious — in retrospect. Interestingly, Adm. Chester Nimitz told skippers what to do (establish the new centers) but not how to do it. This meant that different ships devised different approaches, which provided the basis for subsequent refinements. Hone's history is good as it goes, but it would have been better had he also addressed the Navy's clear failures of the time. For example, it seemed unable to devise an effective response to the German U-boat campaign along the East Coast in 1942. Also, it went into the war having developed a deeply flawed torpedo, the Mark 14, which among other things often failed to detonate, and sometimes ran 10 feet deeper than intended and so passed under enemy warships. These problems seem to raise a few doubts about Hone's thesis that the Navy went into the war as an innovative, flexible organization brilliant at learning from its mistakes and so able to address them quickly. Three other new books are seemingly obscure, but actually quite illuminating. I've been a student of the American military for nearly three decades, but until I picked up AFRICAN AMERICAN OFFICERS IN LIBERIA: A Pestiferous Rotation, 1910-1942 (Potomac, paper, $21.95), I didn't know that for several decades in the early 20th century, the United States Army had a training, advising and leading mission in Liberia. What's more, most of the officers who carried out the mission were black Americans. Brian G. Shellum, a retired Army tank and intelligence officer, does a workmanlike job of relating this neglected tale. The American effort in Liberia had a dual purpose: to fend off encroaching colonial powers, but also to help the 15,000 former American slaves who colonized Liberia to subjugate the approximately 730,000 indigenous people who resented the newcomers. One of the most effective American advisers was Col. Charles Young, who was born a slave in Kentucky in 1864, fought for the Army in the Philippines, was briefly acting superintendent of Sequoia National Park, was active in the N.A.A.C.P. and wound up serving repeated tours in Africa. The book is instructive in the multiple hazards and difficulties of foreign training missions. Liberian government officials wanted to have a military force, but feared having one that was too effective. In a terrible irony, at one point they shunted aside the American advisers and used their own troops to round up indigenous people, who then were shipped to forced labor camps elsewhere in West Africa. It's not often that a work of medieval military history reminds me of a minor BBC comedy show, but that's the case with THE VIKING WARS: War and Peace in King Alfred's Britain, 789-955 (Pegasus, $29.95), by Max Adams. Reading this quirky book, with its heavy reliance on the evidence of coins (where they were minted, what king was depicted on them, what dates they carried, where they were unearthed), brought to mind ""Detectorists,"" a charming television series made a few years ago about the loves and feuds of two amateur archaeologists in eastern England. Adams's book isn't really a military history, and his publisher has done him no favor with the book's American title. It was published last year in Britain as ""Ælfred's Britain: War and Peace in the Viking Age,"" which is a more accurate description. Battles do not figure largely in it, but the reasons for war and their outcomes do. This is an enjoyable book, but it is also very English. At times it feels as if it is veering into Old English, as when Adams, an archaeologist, relates that ""the king of Brycheiniog in southern Wales killed an abbot, called Ecgbehrt, with his companions, provoking the vengeful wrath of the Myrcna hlaefdige. She sent a force to his llys at Brecenanmere, the crannog on Llangorse lake, stormed it and captured his queen."" For all that, Adams doesn't have much to say about the fact that the Norsemen ultimately prevailed, a century after this book closes, with a successful invasion of England in 1066 by William the Conqueror, a descendant of the Viking raider Hrolfr, a.k.a. Rollo. The question of how wars are financed is about as far as one can get from traditional military history about great generals and decisive battles. Yet funding is, of course, essential to conducting almost any war. And as Sarah E. Kreps, the author of TAXING WARS: The American Way of War Finance and the Decline of Democracy (Oxford University, $29.95), points out, war taxes are an especially American issue, given that the United States was founded partly as a result of disputes with Britain over payment of the costs of the French and Indian War, and of the continuing defense of the Colonies. But the financing of wars has become a peculiar political issue nowadays, notes Kreps, a former Air Force officer who teaches government at Cornell University. While our recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been controversial, she observes, how we pay for them has not been. Despite our current partisan polarization, politicians of neither party raise the issue much. She concludes that there now exists a broad, quiet political consensus to insulate the American people from the human and financial costs of their wars. This agreement is insidious, she writes, because it has undermined democratic accountability. One complaint: A volume written by an Ivy League professor and published by Oxford University Press should not contain historical howlers. Two that I noticed: She has Harry Truman losing to Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, and refers to ""the Tea Party Massacre and the origins of the American Revolution,"" a seeming conflation of the Boston Massacre of 1770 and the same city's Tea Party three years later. What does William T. Sherman's march through Georgia in 1864 have to do with today's controversy over Confederate monuments? Lots, I think. The monuments quarrel grows in part out of an incomplete understanding of our past. Monument supporters charge that taking them down reduces our history, but the problem is that many of the people involved in the controversy simply don't know enough history. Imagine, for example, if Southern plantations were more accurately called ""slave labor camps."" Would young lovers then still dream of being married in such places? Likewise, Sherman's march continues to be misunderstood. Contrary to what many Americans still believe, and some are taught, its violence was not indiscriminate. Rather, Sherman was quite precise in directing it against the property (but not the persons) of wealthy Southern die-hards whose assets had been largely untouched by war. Nor was the campaign particularly bloody. As J. D. Dickey notes in RISING IN FLAMES: Sherman's March and the Fight for a New Nation (Pegasus, $29.95), Sherman's casualty rate from campaigning through enemy-held territory for several weeks was minuscule, less than 600 out of 62,000 men. But Sherman did achieve his goal of eviscerating Southern morale, both at home and at the front, where rebel officers realized that their families and homes were unprotected. By doing that, Sherman helped bring an end to the war. He should be ranked among our top five generals, ever. Dickey, the author of ""Empire of Mud,"" looks at the march mainly through the eyes of soldiers and other participants, like nurses. Perhaps as a result of this perspective, he tends to overemphasize the role of subordinate commanders like John Logan, while underestimating Sherman's extraordinary ability to juggle troop movements, logistics and intelligence, all while adapting to a new way of war built around the railroad and the telegraph. So ""Rising in Flames,"" while interesting, is unlikely to take a place alongside essential texts like Joseph T. Glatthaar's ""The March to the Sea and Beyond."" Speaking of Glatthaar, his new book, THE AMERICAN MILITARY: A Concise History (Oxford University, $18.95), carries precisely the right title. In just 127 small pages of text, Glatthaar, a historian at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, gallops through American military history from the French and Indian War all the way to Iraq and Afghanistan. Impressively, he manages to provide a lot more than battle histories, deftly delving into technological advances, social changes and political contexts. Anyone looking for a place to begin understanding the military history of our country would do well to start here. It is all too easy to forget the costs of war for the people who wage it. Some 2.5 million Americans have served in Afghanistan and Iraq. In AFTER COMBAT: True War Stories From Iraq and Afghanistan (Potomac, $29.95), Marian Eide and Michael Gibler seek to construct one big narrative from interviews with 30 veterans about their experiences in those countries. Does this approach work? Yes, and far better than I expected. I finished this book wishing that there were companion volumes for the American Revolution and the Civil War. Eide, an English professor at Texas A&M, and Gibler, a former Army officer, have compiled what amounts to a primer on what it was like to be enlisted in the Army in the post-9/11 era. People who know the military won't be surprised by much, but others can learn a lot from it. And there are still some illuminating surprises. I've covered military operations as a reporter in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, yet I'd never before heard about a kind of ""mortar bingo,"" in which soldiers would bet on where enemy mortar shells would next hit their base. ""After Combat"" captures the odd humor of war. Also, I hadn't before seen this observation from one soldier: ""Most of the platoons had people on suicide watch. … It was the powerlessness, and suicide is one way of getting power back. Suddenly, you're in control again; you can do something. … Part of it is they see violence as a solution."" Finally, it offers a line true in any war: ""It was really boring and then really stressful."" For female soldiers, a major stressor was internal. One comments that ""there was no training about how to deal with the constant advances."" Only one line in the book made me shake my head. I generally appreciated the tone of the editors, which is neither mawkish nor militaristic. But at one point they assert that it is polite for civilians to say to veterans, ""Thank you for your service."" Some vets I know don't mind that phrase, but some others hate it. I think it is better to simply say, ""Welcome home."""
News,2018-11-09,"For some, only new will do.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/realestate/something-new-for-1-million.html,2075," For some, only new will do. With fashionable finishes, trendy technology and a cruise ship's worth of amenities — as well as auras untainted by previous occupants — freshly constructed apartments make the best homes for these buyers. But with an average sale price that exceeds $4 million in Manhattan, or more than twice the $1.6 million average for previously lived-in units, brand-new condominiums can feel out of reach to all but a few. Today's sluggish market, however, is challenging that assumption. Under pressure, some developers are scrapping their original plans and switching out ultraexpensive units for smaller, less pricey versions. At the same time, neighborhoods where condos were once scarce, like Bushwick in Brooklyn and Rockaway Park in Queens, are now seeing projects with below-average prices. What that means is that many snazzy new market-rate condos can now be had for less than $1 million, although that seven-figure cutoff might seem like an only-in-New-York definition of a deal. ""Think about it: We're talking about $1 million as being affordable. Where else in your life would you do that?"" said Klara Madlin, the broker handling sales at the Highbridge, a 39-unit condo from HAP Investments in Washington Heights, at 448 West 167th Street, where every apartment falls in that price range. Eight units remain. (Sales started in 2014, then stopped for several years because of construction issues before resuming about a year ago.) Adam America Real Estate is one developer that adjusted an offering plan for one of its Brooklyn buildings as the market turned. In 2015, when Adam America bought a site at 308 North Seventh Street in Williamsburg, the company envisioned a building with 38 apartments, including 15 three-bedrooms, said Tomer Yogev, Adam America's head of development. But about a year ago Mr. Yogev noticed that buyers were beginning to shy away from pricier apartments at a different condominium he was marketing in Williamsburg, so he decided to reconfigure the building at North Seventh Street, also known as N7. He eliminated some three-bedrooms, shrank the size of the two-bedrooms and increased the number of one-bedrooms. Today, N7, which is next to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, has 45 units: 20 of them one-bedrooms, 20 two-bedrooms and just five three-bedrooms.  Most critical, Mr. Yogev said, is that 17 of the apartments, which Douglas Elliman Real Estate began marketing in September, are priced at $1 million or less. ""We wanted to let buyers enjoy something in their price range,"" he said. In general, Brooklyn seems to be a good place to look for the under-$1 million condo. Last month, Kings County had 197 market-rate condos in that range, according to StreetEasy. About three dozen of those units are in Bushwick, where midsize modernist developments like 267 Evergreen Avenue, an eight-unit condominium from HomeLand Property Group, coexist with shabbier buildings, like the shuttered deli the condo faces. Seven apartments there were listed for under $1 million when the building started sales in August. By last month, half had sold, said Daniel Fried, an Elliman agent who represents the building, where vented stoves, sliding wood balcony doors and distant views of Manhattan are highlights. As Mr. Fried put it, ""One million dollars is a psychological threshold.""  It also may be a financial Rubicon: New York slaps a one-percent ""mansion tax"" on transactions over $1 million, and that extra $10,000 or more is a fee many buyers try to avoid. But to stay on the affordable side of that line, they may have to take a chance on a neighborhood where coffee shops, sit-down restaurants and other mainstays of more popular neighborhoods are limited. ""It's happening, but it's not quite there yet,"" said Marty Hanna, a broker at the Bedrock agency, as he gazed out a window at 1370 Bushwick Avenue, a five-story non-doorman building at the corner of Decatur Street from Urban View Development Group. All 10 apartments at No. 1370, which have oak floors and quartz counters, are priced under $1 million; two-bedrooms that went on the market this summer started at $550,000. Three units are in contract. But even prime Brooklyn neighborhoods are not out of the question. Consider Downtown Brooklyn, where Extell Development Company is at work on Brooklyn Point, the condo portion of the City Point mixed-use development on Flatbush. At the 720-foot tower, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, 24 of the 458 units are studios, 23 of which are listed for under $1 million. The studios, which average about 550 square feet, start at $850,000.  Potentially sweetening any deal, Extell executives said, is the building's 25-year tax abatement, a rarity after the state's 421-a affordable housing program did away with abatements for most condos in a 2017 revamp. Under the abatement, buyers at Brooklyn Point will owe no property taxes for two decades, the equivalent of about $11,000 a year in savings for studios.  Brooklyn Point, Extell's first Brooklyn project, has 40,000 square feet of amenities, including a lounge with a wine bar and a wraparound terrace, a 35-foot climbing wall and a rooftop infinity pool that takes in Manhattan's skyline. Around the corner is a competitor, 11 Hoyt, a pale, cast-concrete spire from Tishman Speyer with 481 apartments. Of them, 116 studios and one-bedrooms are currently priced at $1 million or less, said Erik Rose, a Tishman managing director, although prices could increase soon. Many of those units have unusual bumped-out windows that offer a ledge on which to sit. The apartments also have lava-stone counters and Bosch appliances. ""We wanted to bring high design to Brooklyn,"" Mr. Rose said. The building also has 55,000 square feet of amenities, including an indoor pool, a squash court, music rehearsal rooms, a test kitchen and an elevated park of more than a half acre.  The $3 million to $10 million bracket for condos is hurting across the city, but at this condominium, where units average $1.7 million, or about $1,600 a square foot, ""traffic has been exceptional,"" Mr. Rose said, although he declined to provide sales statistics. Queens had more than six dozen new condos priced at under $1 million from which to choose in October, according to StreetEasy, with about a third in the vicinity of Long Island City, an area awash in construction near the East River. Although prices have climbed in the once-industrial area, the average in the third quarter was still $1.1 million, according to Elliman, down slightly from the preceding quarter. But values could soon climb, with the anticipated announcement from Amazon that it will open a major new office in the neighborhood. And many of the retailer's thousands of employees may seek housing in the area.  Among projects with numerous under-$1 million apartments is Corte, at 21-30 44th Drive, a glassy 85-unit, eight-story project from a team led by CBSK Ironstate. About a third of the units, studios and one-bedrooms fall in that category, said Kayla Lee, a saleswoman with the brokerage Modern Spaces, which is handling marketing. Unsurprisingly, pockets of value can also be found farther from Manhattan. All the apartments at Elmhurst Terrace, a 138-unit two-towered condo at 45-15 82nd Street, in Elmhurst, Queens, are priced at $1 million or below. The project, in a corner of Queens that is attracting developers, seems to be making a play for the Chinese population in nearby Flushing. Two small, local agencies focused on Chinese-speaking buyers have joined the Corcoran Group to market the 42 apartments currently for sale. Yet the building, which has mostly one- and two-bedrooms, is also drawing buyers priced out of Astoria and Long Island City, said Vivian Kuo, a Corcoran sales agent. Seven units are now in contract at the complex, which began marketing in October. And in Rockaway Park, One Sixteen, a condominium with an eight-story tower and a smattering of townhouses at 133 Beach 116th Street — near the last stop on the A train, and the ocean — is offering all but 12 of its 86 units for less than $1 million. ""There is a certain level of quality that comes along with new,"" said Mark Caller, the chief executive of the developer, the Marcal Group. ""Unless there is something unique about the dated one, new is always better, if it's the same price."" In fact, at $600 a square foot, the development's prices are far cheaper than those of most condos in Manhattan, where new developments now average $2,600 a square foot, according to the Corcoran Group. And by November, 10 buyers had signed contracts at the building, which is to open next year. Still, with 67 under-$1 million new-development listings available in October, according to StreetEasy, Manhattan is not entirely off limits to entry-level buyers. Those units are often found in Upper Manhattan, where condos are increasingly common. In Central Harlem, for instance, there is the Rennie, an eight-story, 134-unit offering at 2351 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard from BRP Companies, listed by Halstead Property Development Marketing. Sixty-eight of the 106 market-rate apartments are less listed for less than $1 million, including all of the studios and one-bedrooms, plus a small penthouse with a private terrace, said Jeff Krantz, an associate broker with Halstead. Buyers priced out of more expensive areas like Chelsea, Hell's Kitchen and TriBeCa have been sniffing around, Mr. Krantz added. Finishes at the Rennie, which was named for the Renaissance Ballroom and Casino that once stood on the site at West 138th Street, include oak floors, stainless steel appliances and Ecobee smart thermostats, and building amenities include a work lounge, gym and dog spa. The condo is also offering 27 apartments for below-market rates. But as is the case in other developments, those units will be reserved for people with incomes below certain levels and will be awarded through a lottery expected to draw thousands of applicants. Another nearby condo attracting buyers from elsewhere in Manhattan is 70 West 139th Street, a 64-unit condominium with 21 market-rate and 42 affordable apartments (plus a unit for a superintendent) from Parkadon Management and Development. Last month, a south-facing two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit with a small kitchen, a side-by-side washer and dryer, and a balcony lined with synthetic grass was listed at $995,000. ""The epicenter of value begins north of Central Park,"" said Norman Horowitz, the Halstead agent in charge of sales and, since 2005, an owner of apartment buildings in the area. The under-$1 million segment of the new-development market has been growing. In the third quarter, apartments for less than $1 million made up 16.9 percent of Manhattan's new-development market, as a share of sales, said Jonathan J. Miller, of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc., up from 11.8 percent in that quarter a year ago. At the same time, the average sale price in the ""starter market"" — the bottom 10 percent of all transactions, new and existing units, condos and co-ops — hit a record high in the third quarter of $379,000, while bidding wars were erupting over studios, he said. In fact, records have been set for the last five quarters, suggesting that even as interest in lower-priced units has increased, there still aren't enough to go around, Mr. Miller said.  ""We have been top-end oriented, but the lack of supply is becoming a very significant factor in the entry level,"" he said, noting that steep land and construction costs often make development of these units unfeasible. Buyers shouldn't expect developers to roll out more studios overnight, said Andrew Gerringer, the managing director of the Marketing Directors, a company that helps get condos off the ground. That's because slicing large apartments into smaller ones is not easy once construction has started. ""It's always easier to combine units than to take them apart,"" Mr. Gerringer said. When Michele Papa, 41, began looking to buy last winter, to upgrade from a two-bedroom rental in Sunnyside, Queens, he assumed that ""unless you spend over $1 million, it is probably very, very hard to find new construction,"" he said. But he wound up with a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo at Baldwin Park, a boutique condo in Harlem marketed by CORE Real Estate, for which he paid $945,000. The limited-frills, non-doorman building also has low common charges, about $600 a month, another plus, said Mr. Papa, who moved in last month with his wife, Patricia Cury, 33, and their infant son, Matteo. Soon after, Mr. Papa, a sound engineer, set up a recording studio in his living room, something he thinks would have been difficult to pull off in a co-op.  A less-restrictive condo — and a new one, to boot — is a delight. ""As soon as I walked in,"" he said, ""I thought, 'This is it.'""

The penalties, which grew out of President Trump's decision in May to abandon the Iran nuclear accord, take aim at Iran's oil, banking, shipping, shipbuilding and insurance sectors, and are intended to force Tehran to either abandon its foreign policy ambitions or collapse. Administration officials became almost gleeful in the run-up to Monday: There was a 12-day countdown clock on the State Department's website that resembled an advent calendar; Mr. Trump tweeted a movie-poster-style image of himself with the words ""Sanctions Are Coming"" in a nod to the popular HBO series ""Game of Thrones."" In the show, though, counterattacks are frequent, and the Trump administration is now facing its own backlash. European diplomats are quietly insisting they will complete work in the coming days or weeks on an alternative payment system with Iran that will bypass American sanctions. China, India, Russia and Iraq are likely to defy the new sanctions, too, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said this week that he would ignore them. Iran's leaders remain defiant. The challenges to the administration's Iran strategy are part of a broad pushback around the world to President Trump's aggressive and often bullying tactics, which have won him few friends and caused a steep drop in international regard for the United States. And the tough tactics have yet to prove successful almost anywhere, with threats growing in North Korea, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Administration officials have long said that their strategies had yet to fully gestate. But two years after Mr. Trump's election, that excuse no longer works. When world leaders laughed at Mr. Trump at the United Nations in September, it was an expression of growing international disdain for the president's methods, which rely almost entirely on sticks in the form of sanctions and tariffs instead of the carrots of aid, investment and dialogue. While the United States' use of sanctions has been gradually increasing for decades, Mr. Trump has made them the core of his foreign policy. From Iran to North Korea and Russia to Venezuela, from the drug dealers of Colombia to the bomb makers of Hamas, this administration's first — and sometimes only — instrument to shape world events, punish rivals and discourage challenges to American authority has been sanctions. Last year, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on a record 944 individuals and entities, according to a count provided by the law firm Gibson Dunn. This year, the number is expected to far exceed 1,000, according to Adam M. Smith, who was a top sanctions official in the Obama administration. By comparison, President Barack Obama imposed penalties on 695 individuals and entities in 2016, the previous high mark. ""Sanctions are the perfect tool for someone like President Trump, who arrived into office with no governing experience and no real relationships in Congress, the bureaucracy or among world leaders,"" Mr. Smith said. ""Sanctions let him govern on his own. He just has to write an executive order, and it's done."" Mr. Trump's fondness for sanctions illustrates a core contradiction of his foreign policy. No modern American president has been as dismissive of ""globalism"" or as vigorous in the defense of sovereignty as Mr. Trump. ""We reject the ideology of globalism,"" he said at the United Nations on Sept. 25, adding that ""responsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty not just from global governance, but also from other new forms of coercion and domination."" And yet the power of sanctions springs from the very system of international agreements that Mr. Trump rejects, and it is a device widely seen outside of the United States as an assault on sovereignty and a form of American coercion and domination. In some ways, sanctions are the perfect American weapon. They are cheap, put no American lives at risk and elicit no equivalent response. Thanks to the centrality of the dollar to the global financial system, only the United States has the power to fully wield them. Sanctions' power was demonstrated in April when penalties against the Russian aluminum producer Rusal for its connections to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and against the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE for doing business with Iran and North Korea, crippled the two global giants. The big problem, however, is that sanctions rarely work. Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, said that in his study of 100 years of sanctions efforts, 90 percent of the penalties applied for national security purposes ultimately failed. In some cases, they were disastrous: Japan's 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor was in large part a response to American oil sanctions. Iran proves the point. Tehran's regional meddling was particularly ambitious from 2012 to 2015 — just as sanctions were at their most onerous. There is a small chance that sanctions could lead to the overthrow of Iran's government, but the administration has repeatedly insisted that regime change is not its goal. Besides being largely unsuccessful, the Trump administration's unilateral use of sanctions has fueled a campaign led by Europe, Russia and China to remake the financial system, removing the United States from its heart. The consequences for America's power, economy and alliances could be profound. Even before Mr. Trump's presidency, Jack Lew, Mr. Obama's treasury secretary, warned in 2016 that overuse of sanctions could produce a dangerous reaction ""if foreign jurisdictions and companies feel that we will deploy sanctions without sufficient justification or for inappropriate reasons."" Now, with Mr. Trump's decision to walk away from the Iran nuclear accord and threaten allies who have remained in the deal, the backlash is gathering steam. European diplomats say they are determined, despite real challenges, to follow through on their promise to create a ""special-purpose vehicle"" independent of the dollar to continue commercial relations with Iran. Trump administration officials have reacted with derision and fury and have quietly threatened to sanction the entity.  Chinese and Russian officials have for years been trying to sell Europe on financial messaging and trade vehicles that skirt the dollar and the United States. So far, these efforts have had little success. That could change: ""The world has been comfortable with the dollar as the currency of reference,"" said Nicolas Véron, a French economist and senior fellow at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels. ""But that could change if doing so is seen as carrying a prize in terms of greater geopolitical independence."" Marshall Billingslea, an assistant secretary of the Treasury, said in congressional testimony that efforts to set up alternative financial systems to avoid sanctions are ""something that's a concern to us."" The Trump administration's critics worry that President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, who has said the new sanctions have isolated the United States and not Iran, may be right. They also worry that while Iran's economy will suffer in the short term, the new sanctions will spur the creation of financial mechanisms that exclude the United States, undermining American power, economic might and ability to track and contain terrorism in ways that could far outlast the Trump administration. ""It is foolishness for the United States to accelerate the development of these financial alternatives, which are a profound security threat in the long run,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg, a sanctions official during the Obama administration."
News,2018-11-10,"The Rev. Joseph Musser’s family has always lived in the region of Alsace, but not always in the same country.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/world/europe/europe-armistice-merkel-macron-peace-war.html,1585," The Rev. Joseph Musser's family has always lived in the region of Alsace, but not always in the same country. His grandfather fought for the Germans in World War I, and his father for the French in World War II. Today, no one is fighting anymore. His great-niece lives in France but works in Germany, crossing the border her ancestors died fighting over without even noticing it. It is this era of peace and borderless prosperity that champions of the European Union consider the bloc's singular achievement. ""The foundation of the European Union is the memory of war,"" said the Reverend Musser, 72. ""But that memory is fading."" On Sunday, as dozens of world leaders gather in Paris to mark the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I, the chain of memory that binds Mr. Musser's family — and all of Europe — is growing brittle. The anniversary comes amid a feeling of gloom and insecurity as the old demons of chauvinism and ethnic division are again spreading across the Continent. And as memory turns into history, one question looms large: Can we learn from history without having lived it ourselves? In the aftermath of their cataclysmic wars, Europeans banded together in shared determination to subdue the forces of nationalism and ethnic hatred with a vision of a European Union. It is no coincidence that the bloc placed part of its institutional headquarters in Alsace's capital, Strasbourg. But today, its younger generations have no memory of industrialized slaughter. Instead, their consciousness has been shaped by a decade-long financial crisis, an influx of migrants from Africa and the Middle East, and a sense that the promise of a united Europe is not delivering. To some it feels that Europe's bloody last century might as well be the Stone Age. Yet World War I killed more than 16 million soldiers and civilians, and its legacies continue to shape Europe. ''The war to end all wars'' set the scene for an even more devastating conflict and the barbarism of genocide. Winston Churchill, Britain's legendary wartime leader, thought of 1914-1945 as one long war. ""Those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it,"" he said in 1948. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose decision to welcome more than a million migrants to Germany in 2015 first became a symbol of a liberal European order, then a rallying cry for a resurgent far-right, said the jury is still out on whether Europe will heed the lessons of its past. ""We now live in a time in which the eyewitnesses of this terrible period of German history are dying,"" she said of World War II. ""In this phase, it will be decided whether we have really learned from history."" Indeed, the last World War I veteran died in 2012. And the number of those who experienced World War II and the Holocaust is rapidly shrinking, too. Politicians are apt to use history selectively when it suits them. But the history in this case is ominous. Now as then, Europe's political center is weak and the fringes are radicalizing. Nationalism, laced with ethnic hatred, has been gaining momentum. Populists sit in several European governments. World War I demolished empires and destroyed kings, kaisers and sultans. It introduced chemical weapons and aerial bombing. It brought women into the work force and hastened their legal right to vote. In Italy, a founding member of the European Union, Matteo Salvini, the nationalist deputy prime minister, has turned away migrant boats and called for the expulsion of Roma. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary speaks of a ""Muslim takeover"" and unapologetically flaunts his version of ""illiberal democracy."" ""In 1990, Europe was our future,"" he said earlier this year. ""Now, we are Europe's future."" The political discourse is deteriorating in familiar ways, too. In Germany, the far right has become the main voice of opposition in Parliament, mocking the mainstream media as ""Lügenpresse,"" or lying press — a term that was first used by the Nazis in the 1920s before their ascent to power. Traute Lafrenz, the last surviving member of the White Rose, an anti-Hitler student resistance group in the 1940s, said she got goose bumps seeing images of Hitler salutes at far-right riots in the eastern German city of Chemnitz recently. ""Maybe it's no coincidence,"" Ms. Lafrenz, now 99, told Der Spiegel. ""We are dying out and at the same time everything is coming back again."" After World War II, the European Union sought to prevent anything like it from happening again by gradually creating a common market, a common currency, a passport-free travel zone and by pooling sovereignty in a number of areas. But on Sunday, standing next to Ms. Merkel and her host, the fiercely pro-European French president, Emmanuel Macron, will be a number of nationalist leaders who would like nothing more than to pull the European Union apart — among them President Trump, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Historians guard against drawing direct parallels between the fragile aftermath of World War I and the present, pointing to a number of notable differences. Before World War I, a Europe of empires had just become a Europe of nation states; there was no tried and tested tradition of liberal democracy. Economic hardship was on another level altogether; children were dying of malnutrition in Berlin. Above all, there is not now the kind of militaristic culture that was utterly mainstream in Europe at the time. France and Germany, archenemies for centuries, are closely allied. ""What is being eroded today, is being eroded from a much higher level than anything we had ever achieved in Europe in the past,"" said Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European history at the University of Oxford. Still, Mr. Garton Ash sees 1918 as a warning that democracy and peace can never be taken for granted. ""It's a really sobering reminder that what seems like some sort of eternal order can very rapidly collapse,"" he said. In that sense, if Europe's motto after World War II was ""never again,"" the lesson of World War I is ""it could happen again."" Daniel Schönpflug, a German historian who recently published ""A World on Edge,"" an evocative book tracking 22 characters in the interwar period, points out that for centuries, periods of prolonged war in Europe's violent history have been followed by periods of prolonged peace. ""But once the generation with living memory of fighting had died, the next war came along,"" Mr. Schönpflug said. ""History teaches us that when the generation that experienced war dies out, caution diminishes and naiveté toward war increases."" ""That means we have to be very careful today,"" he said. In 1918, the artist Paul Klee made ''The Comet of Paris,'' a tightrope walker hovering precariously in the air with a comet searing through the sky above and the Eiffel Tower below. What is unnerving about the image is that one cannot discern the rope even though one knows it is there. ""It sums up where people were then, and in a way where we are today,"" said Mr. Schönpflug. No one knows what might come next. Europe has entered the unknown. In 1929, as it happened, people entered a murderous decade without even knowing. ""That's what's so eerie looking back,"" said James Hawes, a historian and author of The Shortest History of Germany. ""Right up to 1931-32, no one realized what was about to happen. They thought they were just entering another decade."" What might future historians write about the Europe of 2018? Antony Beevor, author of a numerous best-selling history books, is pessimistic. The moral dilemmas of the future will undo European liberal democracy, he predicts. The migration crisis of 2015 was only a foretaste of what is to come. ""Future waves of migration are inevitable and Europe is their main destination,"" Mr. Beevor said, pointing to the disruptive forces of poverty and climate change in developing countries as the main reasons. ""European leaders will face the choice of turning back starving refugees or of handing ammunition to the far right and eroding the fabric in their own societies,"" he said. Others see it differently. Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, says the biggest problem facing Europe is not populism but the incomplete currency union of the euro. ""The major threat of Europe at the moment is not Orban or Salvini, the major threat is that the E.U.'s institutional arrangement is unstable,"" Mr. Ferguson said. Mr. Macron's ambition has been to fix that; but there is no consensus backing him. Whatever the future of Europe's institutions, one big difference from 100 years ago is that the Continent is no longer at the heart geopolitics. ""A century ago, Europe was the center of the world — even if it was the dark tragic center of the world,"" said Dominique Moïsi, a French author and thinker. ""Today we might be back to tragedy but not to centrality."" ""History is moving elsewhere,"" he said. That, too, should be a motivation to shore up European integration, says the Reverend Musser in Alsace. One of his grandnieces is doing an internship in China, not Europe. Bones, bombs and bullets remain in the soil of Alsace, a region switched back and forth between various incarnations of France and Germany five times between the Thirty Years' War that ended in 1648 and the devastation of World War II. Local residents joke that Alsatians still keep German street signs in their basements, just in case. The Reverend Musser puts it this way: ""Alsace is a reminder of how much has been won in Europe — and how much can be lost."""

And did I mention that she was a black woman?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/books/review/in-praise-of-ann-petry.html,1118," In 1946, Ann Petry had it all, well before we were wondering if this was even possible for a woman. Born in 1908 (or 1911 — biographers do not agree), Petry was trained as a pharmacist, worked as a reporter, married, and would soon be a mother. Hers was not an overnight success. She paid her dues, publishing short stories and essays, sometimes writing under a male pseudonym. Her star began to rise when she was awarded a $2,500 fellowship from Houghton Mifflin to write her first novel, ""The Street,"" which sold a staggering 1.5 million copies. And did I mention that she was a black woman? So why do so few people read her work today? I really don't know. When I first encountered Petry, I was a student at Spelman College, a historically black women's college in my hometown of Atlanta. My copy of the book sported a classroom-ready cover of muted grays and the title was announced in a blockish, sober font. One of my classmates brought a vintage edition she had found at her parents' home. This cover spotlighted a woman with long hair, hourglass figure and dramatic makeup. The copy promised a tale of violence and vice. My book indicated that the story in my hands was ""a powerful, uncompromising work of social criticism"" or something snoozy like that. Could this possibly be the same book? Absolutely. ""The Street"" is my favorite type of novel, literary with an astonishing plot. The heroine, Lutie Johnson, is a single mother who lives with her 8-year-old son in Harlem. Although her marriage fell apart due to financial hardship caused by racism (and also old-fashioned incompatibility), Lutie still believes in the American Dream. Despite her attempts to be a respectable woman, Lutie's life intersects with the seedier side of Harlem. The building super becomes obsessed with her and puts her dear little boy in harm's way. Her neighbor, a Madam with a heart of gold-plate, saves Lutie from rape, but tries to push her into a relationship with a white man with underworld ties. Add to this bubbling plot an abused wife who seeks the services of a local hoodoo practitioner, a crooked lawyer, a smoky nightclub and murder-by-candlestick and you've got the kind of novel that makes 400 pages seem like too few. Even with the twisty breathless plot, Petry engages the issues of her day, which sadly are the issues of our day as well. At every turn, Lutie confronts that many-headed hydra of racism, sexism and classism. Because of its uncompromising view of injustice and its collateral effects, ""The Street"" has often been called a women's version of Richard Wright's ""Native Son."" Both novels hinge upon murders motivated by heat-of-the-moment spontaneity and deep-seated resentment born of relentless discrimination. However, it is unfair to Petry to think of her artistry as a pink-collared version of Wright. James Baldwin famously criticized Wright's hero in ""Native Son"" by noting that ""Wright imagined Bigger, but Bigger never could have imagined Wright."" Lutie Johnson most certainly could have imagined Petry and would have striven to be like her. Although ""The Street"" is sometimes praised as a ""protest novel"" and sometimes criticized for the same, ""The Street"" is a novel about people and their problems, not problems and their people. Lutie is complicated in her ambition and compassion. Lutie is a good woman, a good mother and a talented singer. But like so many women who follow the rules, a torrent of anger courses through her body, right alongside her blood. When she realizes that her big-break as a singer is really just a powerful man's scheme to force her into sex, she lets loose a lifetime of fury. ""She twisted out of his arms with a sudden, violent motion that nearly sent him off balance. The anger surging through her wasn't directed solely at him. He was there at hand; he had tricked her into staying a few extra minutes in this room with him, because she thought he was going to lend her the money she so urgently needed; and she was angry with him for that and for being a procurer for (his boss) and for assuming she would snatch at an opportunity to sleep with either or both of them. This quick surface anger helped to swell and became a part of the deepening stream of rage that had fed off the hate, the frustration, the resentment she had toward the pattern that her life had followed."" For Lutie there is no #MeToo movement. Ronan Farrow will not be calling her for a quote. Her experience more than fifty years ago is very similar to that of women today who are poor and of color. She must save herself, understanding that there will be devastating consequences for standing her ground. I recently reread ""The Street"" and I just can't figure out why this work is not more widely read and celebrated. After such a stunning reception in the 1940s, why hasn't this novel become a college staple? After all, Petry's fiction would be a godsend for professors who are looking for a book that students would actually want to read. I recall my own college days when this book was assigned. We stayed late, missing lunch because we had so much to say. And even outside the classroom, these novels would be book club gold. Maybe a better question is what can be done to ignite an Ann Petry revival? Sometimes when a writer is regarded as ""before her time"" we don't quite understand that the same work is still right on time. Petry is the writer we have been waiting for, hers are the stories we need to fully illuminate the questions of our moment, while also offering a page-turning good time. Ann Petry, the woman, had it all, and so does her insightful, prescient and unputdownable prose. Beyond 'The Street': An Ann Petry Starter Kit 'THE NARROWS' Petry's second novel continues with her penchant for marrying social commentary with complicated plot work. Both meaningful and scandalous, ""The Narrows"" is the story of a doomed interracial romance that proves that passion and prejudice are not mutually exclusive. 'TITUBA OF SALEM VILLAGE' This YA novel reminds us that Petry was a writer from New England. Tituba was the enslaved black woman who was the first person accused of practicing witchcraft in the infamous Salem Witch Trials. 'MISS MURIEL AND OTHER STORIES' Thirteen short stories that delve into the complicated world of interpersonal racism. A highlight is ""The Bones of Louella Brown"" in which the bones of a black servant are commingled with those of a Boston Brahman — panic ensues. It's funny, but it's not funny."
News,2018-11-10,"Susan Good was sitting with a group of women in her home in Palm Springs, Calif., when one of them began lamenting the difficulties of aging.

Unseen. As if she had nothing to contribute to the world.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/style/intergenerational-womens-groups.html,1779," Susan Good was sitting with a group of women in her home in Palm Springs, Calif., when one of them began lamenting the difficulties of aging. But it wasn't the usual script about aches, pains and skyrocketing cholesterol levels. ""She said that she felt invisible,"" recalled Ms. Good, who is in her 70s. The speaker felt generally silenced. Unseen. As if she had nothing to contribute to the world. This shocked Ms. Good. ""Invisible"" was the last word she would have used to describe this woman. ""She was very popular with a great personality,"" she said. But then the other women in the room echoed the same feelings. ""These were all women who had college degrees, were married or had a significant other, were well traveled and led very nice lifestyles, but every one of them felt invisible,"" she said. ""They felt invisible when they saw themselves in the mirror. They didn't feel pretty any longer. Nobody was looking at them."" The word continued to haunt her, and she wondered if she could help address this prevalent feeling. So in 2015 Ms. Good, whose nickname is ""Honey,"" created a website for women 50 and over, HoneyGood.com, which offers advice on everything from pedicures to the stock market to grandparenting (she has two children, one stepchild and 26 grandchildren; a book, ""Stories for my Grandchild,"" comes out in February).  But rather than keep her initiative strictly online, Ms. Good in September started Moxie!: a free private social network on her website where women could bond. The idea was for them to share their stories, concerns and triumphs not just with people in their same age group, but across generations. IRL. At her monthly Moxie! group in Palm Springs, now in its third year, women in their 60s munch on cookies and sip coffee while mingling with women in their 80s. At a recent gathering in Chicago, where she lives half the year, guests ranged from 29 to 93. ""We talk about money issues, blended families, widowhood, invisibility,"" Ms. Good said. ""We talk about problems between mothers and daughters. The only rule I have is that nothing leaves my home."" Ms. Good's Moxie! group is one of a handful of informal, intergenerational women's gatherings that have started recently in cities around the country. Distinct from the Lean In circles started by Sheryl Sandberg, which tended to focus on career, these groups are filling a necessary void: As a January 2018 J. Walter Thompson trend report of women 53 to 72 noted, women in this age group are usually overlooked or ignored.  In most other countries, young and old freely mix together, with several generations often living under one roof. But in the United States, that mostly happens in the workplace. Even so, millennials and baby boomers tend to stick with their same-aged cohort, rarely associating out of the office. This is a limited way of socializing that cross-generational groups seek to expand. ""A lot of people think if they're mothers they can only be friends with mothers; if they're single they can only hang out with single people,"" said Shasta Nelson, 41, the author of ""Frientimacy,"" a book about deepening friendships that was published in 2016. ""But research suggests that it doesn't matter what commonality we have, only that we find a couple of commonalities. If I say, 'I'm in my 40s and I only want to meet people in my 40s,' it's as much of a predictor of friendship as saying I can only be friends with people born in September or who like Madonna or who have my name."" According to Ms. Nelson, only three things are necessary for a relationship to flourish: positivity (it has to feel good); consistency (you have to be in touch on a regular basis); and vulnerability (you have to feel safe with each other). None of them has to do with age. ""A friendship is any relationship where two people both people feel seen in a safe and satisfying way,"" she said. Ten years ago, Ms. Nelson created GirlFriend Circles, a kind of match.com for women to meet online and take it offline if they choose. She later started Travel Circles, which helps women of all ages take trips to meet other women around the world. Angela Wilkinson, 48, a self-described ""suburban housewife in Middle America"" (in this case, Marion, Iowa), went to Greece, Italy, Rwanda and Peru with Ms. Nelson. With two sons now in their early 20s, one of whom has special needs, Ms. Wilkinson said she always felt isolated at home, and unable to meet new people.  ""It's hard to make friends as an adult,"" she said. ""I didn't have friends who were older or younger."" On her trips with Ms. Nelson, she became close with two women: one of whom is 13 years older than she is, another who is 14 years younger. They have remained in touch and have even taken other vacations together. ""What helped bridge the age gap with friendship is when you're in a new situation or uncomfortable in some way — it's just a great equalizer,"" Ms. Wilkinson said. ""We're all in the same boat. On these trips everyone's on these new situations. The age goes out the window."" Though Lean In is less spoken of these days, some intergenerational women's gatherings are focused on professional advancements. Erica Keswin, 50, is a workplace strategist who started the Spaghetti Project, a monthly gathering in her Manhattan home of like-minded individuals two years ago. (The name came from a study she read Kevin Kniffin, a professor at Cornell who found that firefighters who ate meals together had higher performance levels than those who dined solo.) Some are free; others have a nominal cost. Ms. Keswin models her salons, which do include pasta, after today's average white-collar workplace, where multiple generations share one roof and are forced to interact. ""Groups of people need to come together in an intentional way,"" she said. ""It's good for us personally and in business. Regardless of where it is and who's there, good things happen when people connect."" Spaghetti Project attendees are invited not by age but by a common denominator, usually work related: They're all in the food industry, say, or obsessed with conscious capitalism, or trying to transition out of freelance writing. ""When I curate these events I want diversity of thought — race, gender, age — and not just people from the same schools or background,"" said Ms. Keswin, the author of ""Bring Your Human to Work,"" about encouraging personal authenticity in the office. ""We want people at different stages of their career."" That's also the thinking behind Generation Women, a monthly reading series in New York and Sydney, Australia, where women from multiple generations read short stories and essays loosely centered around a theme. The series came about after a conversation its founder, the novelist Georgia Clark, 38, had with her mother about ""disappearing"" in later life. ""She said that as she had gotten older people looked right through her,"" Ms. Clark said. ""If we're walking down the street together they'll just look at me, and if she's alone it's as if she's not there."" ""I was aware of ageism as an issue, but because it was something my mother said it really made it personal and I got mad,"" she continued. ""I wanted to do something about it. I wanted to create a storytelling event where women of all ages could come together and feel comfortable and heard. We make a lot of space in our society for teens through 30s, for their experiences and journeys and point of views, but we don't make space for women in their 60s, 70s and 80s, who are still going through changes and evolution and whose perspectives are so much greater."" Some participants find these sorts of intergenerational gatherings comforting in a divisive political climate. Younger women are seeking solace in the assurance of older women, who have lived through political uncertainty or wartime, that everything will be O.K. Older women appreciate the passion and drive of younger women in case everything isn't. ""I'm blown away by their emotional sills and self-awareness,"" said Christine Mulvey, 60, a writer in Nevada City, Calif., who attends annual Honey Root Embodiment Gathering intergenerational retreats (no relation to Honey Good). ""Things I came to in my 40s and 50s, young women are coming to so much earlier. I find permission to be themselves and to be creative in them that just thrills me. I'm delighted by it. Their hunger for real connection and depth, their passion for the world."" ""And then there's a darker side to that,"" Ms. Mulvey said. ""The passion that I see in them can slip into a kind of despair. There's something about being older and having been through a number of cycles from different eras that kind of holds the despair at bay, and also calls it into a sense of how important it is that they show up and engage."" At HoneyRoot's Embodiment Gathering (yes, the name is a little woo-wooey, but it is California, after all), which lasts four days and costs $495 to $750, depending on financial means, certain women are given ""elder"" status, which means they're treated as valued members whose experiences are honored and respected. They, in turn, welcome the ""youngers"" into adulthood. (Each woman determines for herself when she's an ""elder"" — for most woman it's when they are postmenopausal.) ""I think our younger members have an understanding that strangely not everyone does, that one day they will be older women and that we're all responsible for creating a society that honors older women,"" said Devorah Bry, 40, the founder of HoneyRoot, who is a dancer and couple's therapist in Nevada City, Calif.  ""The dominant culture tells you that when you get to a certain age you can't be included anymore,"" Ms. Bry said. ""It's cool to see certain people who say, 'I don't want you to see my age, I want you to see my age and spirit.' Then other people who are in the same room who want you to acknowledge that 'I'm older and living in a different type of body now, I want to be honored that I have life experience now.' It's really about paying attention. We're all going to get to the end of our life."" Jessica Arnold, 30, started going to HoneyRoot two years ago. She was feeling adrift, and worried about the country.  ""I really felt I needed more connection with older people, especially politically — I feel really lost,"" Ms. Arnold said. ""But I also have this sense that history repeats itself and that it's a continuum that has happened throughout history. I need the guidance and remembrance that times like these have happened before and to keep your eyes set on something greater."""
News,2018-11-10,"PARIS — They shook hands politely and patted each other on the arm stiffly. Their tight-lipped smiles appeared strained and forced. No cheeks were kissed, no friendly rubs were given, none of the bonhomie of their earlier meetings was on display.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/world/europe/world-war-i-trump-macron.html,1559," PARIS — They shook hands politely and patted each other on the arm stiffly. Their tight-lipped smiles appeared strained and forced. No cheeks were kissed, no friendly rubs were given, none of the bonhomie of their earlier meetings was on display. So much for the bromance. After a promising start, the relationship between President Trump and President Emmanuel Macron of France has soured. By the time they met in Paris on Saturday, the trans-Atlantic alliance that was to be showcased by this weekend's commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I appeared to be fraying instead. ""The honeymoon is well and truly over,"" said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""Trump's visible contempt for allies over trade and the Iran nuclear deal are humiliating for Macron. There were high hopes of Macron's charm offensive, but Trump's actions have shown that it had no policy impact and that it is dangerous for any political leader to tie his reputation to the mercurial mood swings of the American president."" It did not help on Saturday that Mr. Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery at the foot of the hill where the Battle of Belleau Wood was fought. Aides cited the rain; the Marines who pilot presidential helicopters often recommend against flying in bad weather. But that did not convince many in Europe who saw it as an excuse and another sign of disrespect. ""They died with their face to the foe and that pathetic inadequate @realDonaldTrump couldn't even defy the weather to pay his respects to The Fallen,"" Nicholas Soames, a Conservative member of the British Parliament and grandson of Winston Churchill, wrote on Twitter. He added the hashtag: #hesnotfittorepresenthisgreatcountry. Ben Rhodes, who was deputy national security adviser to President Barack Obama, dismissed the explanation. ""I helped plan all of President Obama's trips for 8 years,"" he tweeted. ""There is always a rain option. Always."" Mr. Trump will have another chance to pay respects to the war dead on Sunday with a scheduled visit to the Suresnes American Cemetery outside Paris following the ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe marking the anniversary of the armistice at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. But he will not stay for a Paris peace forum that Mr. Macron is sponsoring to bring together world leaders to discuss ways to avoid conflict. ""Trump's absence from the Peace forum tomorrow, apparently alone among the 72 heads of state and government, will have a negative impact — the man who did not even pretend to work for peace, as it were,"" said François Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a research organization. In a five-minute session with reporters before their meeting on Saturday, Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron sought to defuse simmering tension over security and trade. Mr. Macron reassured his visitor that his proposal to create a ""true European army"" was in harmony with Mr. Trump's repeated insistence that Europe stop relying so much on the United States for its defense. World War I demolished empires and destroyed kings, kaisers and sultans. It introduced chemical weapons and aerial bombing. It brought women into the work force and hastened their legal right to vote. ""I do share President Trump's views that we need much better burden-sharing within NATO, and that's why I do believe my proposals for European defense are utterly consistent with that,"" Mr. Macron said with Mr. Trump at the Élysée Palace. Mr. Trump, who had called the idea of a European army ""very insulting"" in a tweet three minutes after Air Force One landed in France on Friday, said he was glad to hear Mr. Macron's reasoning. ""He understands the United States can only do so much, in fairness to the United States,"" Mr. Trump said. The flap may have resulted from misleading accounts of Mr. Macron's comments, which came in an interview in French with Europe 1 radio this week. In the interview, Mr. Macron said that Europe needed to defend itself against the United States as well as Russia and China, but he was referring to cyberthreats, not the American government. The discussion of a European army actually came up later in the interview, and he characterized it as lightening America's burden, not defending against it. Still, Mr. Macron was critical in the interview of Mr. Trump's move to scrap the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, a three-decade-old agreement that eliminated a whole class of missiles stationed in and aimed at Europe. The United States has accused Russia of violating the treaty and Mr. Trump seems focused on whether such missiles might be useful in countering China, but European leaders see it as reopening a threat to their own countries. ""When I see President Trump announcing that he's quitting a major disarmament treaty, which was formed after the 1980s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim?"" Mr. Macron said in the interview. ""Europe and its security."" The tense meeting with Mr. Trump contrasted with Mr. Macron's joint appearance with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany later in the day. At a solemn ceremony in the woods outside the northern town of Compiègne where the armistice was signed on Nov. 11, 1918, the two leaders stood in front of a plaque celebrating peace and Franco-German friendship. It was the first time a German leader had returned to the spot where both World War I and World War II armistices were concluded. After conquering France in 1940, Adolf Hitler forced the defeated French to return the same railway car used in 1918 to consecrate Germany's defeat, a way of humiliating his vanquished foe. On Saturday, Mr. Macron and Ms. Merkel entered a similar car that now sits inside a museum at the site and sat glumly side by side for a few moments. The original car was destroyed during the second war and much at the site razed on Hitler's orders. The ceremony, simple yet symbolic, was over in 45 minutes, after the French and German national anthems were sung. ""The symbolism of it is, it's not just a question of military victory, or military defeat, but of friendship between France and Germany, and also that both sides have overcome this defeat,"" said Sylvain Fort, a top aide to Mr. Macron. ""We've overcome this defeat to build a friendship that's lasted 70 years."" The meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron earlier in the day seemed decidedly chillier than their warm session in Washington in April when they smiled broadly, hugged, kissed each other on the cheeks and lavished praise on each other. During their short appearance before reporters, Mr. Trump remained formal and distant. When he avoided sharp language in front of the cameras, Mr. Macron appeared relieved and patted Mr. Trump's leg appreciatively. ""We have become very good friends over the last couple of years,"" Mr. Trump said, with none of the enthusiasm of last spring. ""We have much in common in many ways — perhaps more ways than people would understand. But we are — we're very much similar in our views."" Mr. Macron referred to Mr. Trump as ""my good friend"" and said they had ""worked very closely together"" in countering Syria's use of chemical weapons. ""Our people are very proud to have you here,'' he said. A major point of contention is Mr. Trump's decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran following his withdrawal from the multinational accord intended to curb the country's nuclear program. The French want to continue doing business with Iran and resent pressure by the Americans. The Trump administration  waived the sanctions for eight countries, but France was not among them. One of Mr. Macron's senior advisers complained about bullying by Washington earlier this week. ""Europe refuses to allow the U.S. to be the trade policeman of the world,"" Bruno Le Maire, the economy minister, told The Financial Times. The two sides remain at odds over broader trade issues as well. Mr. Trump has slapped steel and aluminum tariffs on Europe and other trading partners, and has threatened tariffs on cars manufactured in Europe. Mr. Trump said negotiations to ease the tariff war have been promising. ""We've made a lot of progress,"" he said. ""We'll see if we can get it over the line, as they say."" Mr. Trump remains deeply unpopular in Europe, especially in France, where just 9 percent think he will do the right thing in international relations, according to the Pew Research Center. The president's seeming indifference to European sensibilities was reinforced by a report in Le Monde, the French newspaper, that in a meeting with the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania earlier this year, Mr. Trump confused the Baltic states for Balkan states and blamed them for the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Mr. Macron understands the importance of maintaining the relationship, said Karen Donfried, president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. But ""domestically,"" she said, ""it may be better for him if the bromance has cooled visibly."" Charles A. Kupchan, a former Europe adviser to Mr. Obama, said that Europe has all but given up on Mr. Trump and is focused instead on developing its own ""strategic autonomy"" to make it less dependent on the United States. ""Trump might be able to retain decent working relationships with populist governments in Italy, Poland, and Hungary,"" he said. ""But the rest of Europe is resigned to running out the clock, hoping and praying that Trump is a one-term president."""
News,2018-11-10,"DES MOINES — Partway through his stump speech at the Iowa State Fair in August, Representative John Delaney spotted a familiar face walking by.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/politics/john-delaney-2020-iowa.html,1360," DES MOINES — Partway through his stump speech at the Iowa State Fair in August, Representative John Delaney spotted a familiar face walking by. ""Mr. Speaker!"" he called from his perch atop The Des Moines Register's soapbox. ""What a nice surprise. Speaker Boehner is in the house. You're looking good, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate you coming out and supporting me, I really do."" John Boehner, the former House speaker, wearing a blue-and-white gingham shirt almost identical to Mr. Delaney's — and looking distinctly as though he wished he had taken a different route from the pork chop stand to the parking lot — was instantly surrounded by reporters. ""I worked on a lot of stuff with him. He's a good member,"" was about all Mr. Boehner, a Republican, would say of Mr. Delaney, a Maryland Democrat running for president. ""Oh God. I'm just walking by. If it weren't Delaney there — I'm walking by, I got a pork chop, I was walking by, I saw Delaney. I said, 'Aw, I'll stop.' I should have known better. I should have kept walking."" It was hardly a reaffirming moment for Mr. Delaney, but he will take any recognition he can get. Political junkies like to joke that the 2020 campaign began the moment the polls closed on Tuesday, but Mr. Delaney is already more than a year into his.  He is well aware that better-known Democratic politicians like Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are attracting more news coverage even though they have not yet officially declared, and he knows that even though he is the only major candidate running right now, he is running from behind.  So why do it? ""I think I'm the right person for the job, but not enough people knew who I was or still know who I am,"" Mr. Delaney, 55, said. ""The way to solve that problem, it seems to me, is to get in early and just work harder than everyone else."" While Mr. Boehner's clear discomfort showed how little he had expected to run into a campaign-trail press scrum more than two years before the 2020 election, Mr. Delaney seemed to thoroughly enjoy the pageantry in Iowa, whose caucuses are the first test for presidential candidates at the ballot box. He strolled over to WHO-HD's corn poll and dropped a kernel in a jar for Fred Hubbell, the Democratic candidate for governor, who would lose three months later. He grabbed a rug and went on the Giant Slide with the youngest of his four daughters, Grace, 11, who looked unconvinced of the wisdom of this activity.  That night, he would cheerfully recall the Boehner encounter in a speech at the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding.  And two days later, he would hit the last of Iowa's 99 counties, completing a classic campaign feat before any better-known opponent started. He isn't running for re-election to the House, the better to go ""all in"" on running for president. It's hard to overstate how unusual Mr. Delaney's timeline is. He announced his candidacy on July 28, 2017, almost three years before the Democratic convention. John T. Woolley, co-director of the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said that with the arguable exception of President Trump, whose campaign apparatus never disbanded after 2016, he didn't know of ""any case of a serious major-party candidate announcing so far before the election.""  Characteristically for a man who spent much of his career in finance — and who listened to one Iowan describe how the cost of his medication had skyrocketed and proceeded to calculate the ""annual compounded increase"" in his head — Mr. Delaney likened his campaign start date to inflation-adjusted dollars. ""Campaigns have gotten much longer,"" he said. ""When Jimmy Carter announced, which was effectively right after the midterms — back then, on a relative pace, this was similar to what I'm doing now."" Mr. Carter was the quintessential ""came out of nowhere"" candidate, something Mr. Delaney hopes to duplicate. But the retail politicking that lifted Mr. Carter in 1976 is not as decisive as it once was. Around this time in 2015, the five Republicans who had visited Iowa the most were all polling in the bottom half of the pack. Two days after the caucuses in 2016, not one was still in the race. And yet, by some measures, Mr. Delaney's strategy has been effective. In an Emerson College poll in September, only 21 percent of Iowa voters were unfamiliar with him. At the Iowa State Fair, one couple — Connie Waller, 74, and Don Waller, 75, farmers in nearby Van Meter — even recognized him from his TV ads.  ""He's just coming out and saying, 'Here's who I am and here's what I believe in,'"" Ms. Waller said approvingly. ""I like him right now. But there's not a lot of others."" Mr. Delaney's central message is simple: Globalization has been an ""extraordinarily positive"" force, he says, but not for everyone, and politicians should have acted — through tax incentives, infrastructure investments, better public education, universal health care — to make it positive for more people. Instead, they were ""too busy fighting."" In an interview on his campaign bus, winding through corn and soybean fields west of Des Moines, he said he would start to change that by dedicating the first 100 days of his administration exclusively to existing bipartisan legislation. He cited a criminal justice overhaul drafted by Mr. Booker and Rand Paul; immigration reform as proposed in a bill that passed the Senate with a supermajority in 2013, but that Mr. Boehner refused to bring to the House floor; and repairs to the Affordable Care Act outlined by Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray.  ""So much of politics these days has become, quote, 'about politics,'"" Mr. Delaney said in an earlier interview, adding that he wanted to emphasize civility, bipartisanship and compromise. ""People getting into these pointless arguments about ideology, and are you left or center or progressive, or all this garbage."" A self-described ""pragmatic idealist,"" Mr. Delaney was a businessman before he was elected to the House in 2012: the founder of two financial companies and, at one point, the youngest chief executive on the New York Stock Exchange. Those companies made him one of the wealthiest members of Congress, with an estimated net worth of more than $90 million — allowing him now to finance most of his campaign while, by his own acknowledgment, not yet focusing on fund-raising. At the end of the last quarter, he had raised about $1 million and contributed $2.5 million of his own money. But on the trail, he emphasizes his working-class roots. Neither of his parents went to college. His father, an electrician, belonged to a union that covered half of Mr. Delaney's tuition at Columbia, ""which has always been a great reminder for me that none of us do it alone in life,"" he said to a crowd in Adel. ""I would have nothing that I have today but for a bunch of electricians reaching into their pockets."" Mr. Delaney's strategy is classic small-town retail politics. Over five days in August — his 14th trip to Iowa — he covered more than 700 miles and held more than two dozen events, many of them featuring fewer than 20 people in cities with populations of barely more than 1,000.  At a cafe in Greenfield (population 1,800), he met with the Adair County Optimist Club. In Panora (population 1,100), he campaigned for a House candidate, Cindy Axne, and the Democratic nominee for Iowa's secretary of agriculture, Tim Gannon.  In Grundy Center (population 2,700), he canvassed with Dennis Evans, a candidate for the Iowa House. In Atlantic (population 6,700), he visited the farm of another Iowa House candidate, Denise O'Brien, and asked her about agriculture policy.  Less than five hours later, he added one of Ms. O'Brien's policy suggestions — making the national farm bill last longer than five years — to his stump speech.  At the Greenfield event in particular, Mr. Delaney received a warm welcome. Afterward, Marcia Fulton, 77, of Creston, declared herself ""extremely impressed."" But she also said she was ""anxious to see who else comes into"" the race. The caucuses, after all, were still more than 500 days away."
News,2018-11-10,"PHOENIX — At first, the Republican looked as if she could win Arizona’s Senate race by a razor-thin margin. Then the Green Party emerged as a potential spoiler, even though its candidate had dropped out of the race. Now the Democrat has taken the lead.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/arizona-senate-sinema-mcsally-green-party.html,1035," PHOENIX — At first, the Republican looked as if she could win Arizona's Senate race by a razor-thin margin. Then the Green Party emerged as a potential spoiler, even though its candidate had dropped out of the race. Now the Democrat has taken the lead. Confused yet? The battle for the seat being vacated by Senator Jeff Flake, the Republican ridiculed time and again by President Trump, is just getting started. Arizona's election officials say it could take days for a winner to emerge as they steadily count hundreds of thousands of ballots after a surge in turnout around the state. Mr. Trump is weighing in, claiming without offering proof that corruption is tainting the race. The chairman of the Arizona Republican Party is accusing the top election official in Phoenix of voter fraud, prompting angry rebuttals from Democrats who seem to be clawing back in a Republican bastion. ""Welcome to the new Arizona,"" said Joseph Garcia, the director of the Latino Public Policy Center at Arizona State University. ""We're slowly shifting from a red conservative state to a blue progressive state. Will this process be smooth at every turn? No way."" In a state that is home to conservative icons like Joe Arpaio and Jan Brewer, the power struggle is revealing one potential path forward for Democrats fighting to win elections in a state where they haven't won an open Senate seat since 1976: embrace the center. [Here's a look at how close the results are in Arizona, Georgia and Florida.] Kyrsten Sinema, 42, the Democrat in the race, started out as a liberal but moved hard to the middle after winning a seat in the House of Representatives in 2012. She drew attention for staking out relatively conservative positions on various issues, sometimes siding with Mr. Trump and other Republicans. Some liberal Democrats were left aghast by such positioning, but it seems to be working for Ms. Sinema, who is currently ahead of her rival by about 29,800 votes. About 150,000 voters who cast ballots for Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican who sailed to re-election this week, also voted for Ms. Sinema, tallies show, suggesting that her strategy of appealing to moderate Republicans and independent voters may be working. At the same time, her Republican opponent, Martha McSally, 52, a congresswoman and former United States Air Force pilot, drifted away during the campaign from centrist positions to a more energetic embrace of Mr. Trump on issues like building a wall on the border with Mexico. Arizona is just one state where voting has been marked by confusion, rancor and undecided races in the aftermath of the midterm elections. Races in Florida and Georgia also remain extremely close. In Arizona, election officials emphasized the need to count mail-in ballots, early ballots dropped off on Election Day and provisional ballots. Turnout was unusually robust in the state, with some estimates reaching as high as 65 percent, the highest level in decades. Republican officials filed a lawsuit against Adrian Fontes, a Democrat and the top election official in Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, over the way that signatures on ballots are verified. But a settlement was quickly reached requiring all counties in the state to continue checking signatures until Nov. 14. In a state where Republicans have exerted near hegemonic control in some levels, Ms. Sinema's strategy of appealing to voters on both sides of the fence comes with obvious risks. For instance, in the closing days of the race, the Republican Party sent out mailers to some Democratic voters in the state. The leaflets didn't mention the Republican or Democrat in the race but the Green Party candidate, Angela Green, and her support for policies like legalizing marijuana and robustly expanding public health care. ""It was a classic reverse psychology tactic,"" said Tyler Montague, a Republican campaign strategist in Arizona, emphasizing how the mailers may have had the effect of peeling away liberal support for Ms. Sinema, while bolstering Ms. Green. Never mind that Ms. Green dropped out of the race and endorsed Ms. Sinema. Ms. Green, 48, who works in the mortgage industry and is an avowed progressive, still received about 47,000 votes — far more than the 29,800-vote lead currently held by Ms. Sinema over Ms. McSally. The small Green Party's role in the race has elicited recriminations from Democrats over the possibility that their candidate could end up losing to a Republican closely aligned with President Trump if the final vote count shifts in Ms. McSally's favor. We're tracking the votes as they are tallied in two races for governor and two for Senate that have slim margins. ""That underestimates the intelligence of the tens of thousands of people who voted for me,"" said Ms. Green. ""Obviously there are a lot of people out there who are very frustrated with both sides."" In a state where registered Republicans still easily outnumber Democrats, promoting Green Party candidates is nothing new. In 2010, a Republican political operative went so far as to recruit drifters and homeless people onto the Green Party ballot in an effort to siphon some support from Democrats. And in a twist involving some irony, Ms. Sinema got her start in politics as an activist and spokeswoman for the Green Party in Arizona. She then joined the Democratic Party, won a seat in the State Legislature and went on to be elected in 2012 to the U.S. House of Representatives. The confusion surrounding the race is eliciting different reactions from voters. ""I'm glad they're taking the time to do it right,"" said Brenda Palmer, 57, a financial reporting manager with the Arizona State Retirement System. Ms. Palmer said she voted in the past for both Republicans and Democrats but opted for the first time in this election to vote a straight Democratic ticket. ""Sometimes they come back so quickly I wonder how accurate can it be,"" Ms. Palmer added, referring to the way election results are released in Arizona. Others were already expressing fatigue with an often venomous race in which Democrats and Republicans spent heavily on attack ads. ""I didn't care for either of them because of the way they went after one another,"" said Roger Quaing, 72, a retired manager of auto parts warehouses. Still, he voted for the Republican in the race. ""I felt McSally was the lesser of two evils."""
News,2018-11-10,"HONG KONG — An exiled Chinese novelist spoke at a literary festival in Hong Kong on Saturday, two days after his appearance had been briefly canceled in a move that was widely seen as the latest erosion of freedoms in the semiautonomous city.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/world/asia/ma-jian-hong-kong-literary-festival.html,901," HONG KONG — An exiled Chinese novelist spoke at a literary festival in Hong Kong on Saturday, two days after his appearance had been briefly canceled in a move that was widely seen as the latest erosion of freedoms in the semiautonomous city. The writer, Ma Jian, whose appearances at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival were reinstated at the last minute, said the reversal ""proves the failure"" of self-censorship. Mr. Ma, a British citizen who lives in exile in London, said on Saturday that a robust literary culture helps to ""safeguard the bottom line of our civilization."" ""Of course there is no way literature can resist a political force,"" he told reporters at a hastily arranged news conference. But he said that ""in fiction we find our real roots: the goodness of human nature."" There had been concern that Mr. Ma might be taking a security risk by even traveling to Hong Kong, where a few booksellers who published titles critical of China's Communist government have disappeared in recent years, only to turn up in custody on the Chinese mainland. Mr. Ma's appearances at the Tai Kwun Center for Heritage and Arts were thrown into doubt on Thursday when the venue said it would not host them. Mr. Ma's books have been banned in mainland China since 1987, and he says his new novel, the biting satire ""China Dream,"" is a political allegory of the country's modern self. ""We do not want Tai Kwun to become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual,"" Timothy Calnin, the center's director, said in a statement on Thursday. ""We have therefore worked closely with the Hong Kong International Literary Festival to find a more suitable alternative venue."" Tai Kwun reversed course on Friday, saying it had ""reconsidered our position in light of the possibility that these events might be prevented from taking place altogether."" Yet it was unclear on Friday whether Mr. Ma, who previously lived in Hong Kong and has permanent resident status here, would even be allowed to enter the city when his flight landed that evening. He later said on Twitter that he would be speaking at the festival as a novelist, ""which is my only identity,"" and that he was not a politician. ""But anyone who has ever read me knows that my books are deeply political, and China Dream is no exception,"" he added. ""All literature is political, whether the writer intends it to be or not."" Phillipa Milne, the festival's director, told reporters on Saturday that its goal was to promote Hong Kong's literary arts while also ""supporting the principles of free speech by providing a platform for a diverse spectrum of inspirational local and international writers."" She did not take questions. The festival came amid growing concerns about Hong Kong's future as a haven for rule of law and civil rights in Asia. Last week, for example, the political cartoonist Badiucao, whose works satirize leaders of mainland China and Hong Kong, called off a solo exhibition in Hong Kong after receiving threats from the Chinese authorities. On Thursday, the Hong Kong authorities denied entry as a visitor to Victor Mallet, an editor at The Financial Times, a few weeks after he was expelled from the city. Mr. Mallet's expulsion was widely seen as retaliation for his role in hosting a talk with a local independence advocate at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong in August. On Saturday, Mr. Ma declined to directly answer a question about whether he felt safe in Hong Kong, but he noted that he had informed the British authorities of his travel plans. ""I know if I ever disappear, they will look for me,"" he added. Emily Lau, a former Democratic Party member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, said the back-and-forth over Mr. Ma's appearances created an emotional ""roller coaster"" for many people in the city. Ms. Lau said she believed the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which finances and operates the Tai Kwun center, had faced political pressure to cancel Mr. Ma's visit, and that the reversal of the cancellation was not much of a victory because it had already set a damaging precedent. ""In Hong Kong we've never had democracy, but we enjoy freedoms,"" she said. ""Now it seems our freedoms are being taken away."" A spokeswoman for the Jockey Club did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday evening. Mr. Ma, 65, has been barred from entering mainland China since 2011, and he spoke at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival as recently as 2013. He was back this year to speak at a panel discussion on Hong Kong literature and to promote ""China Dream,"" whose title refers to the signature catchphrase of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The book, published in Britain this month, charts the disintegration of a Chinese official who is haunted by his violent past. On Saturday evening, Mr. Ma told a packed auditorium that the totalitarian society that George Orwell had described in his dystopian novel ""1984"" had now been ""completely and totally"" realized in China. He also said he saw repression and propaganda in the Chinese mainland today that was eerily similar to that of the Cultural Revolution. He said he feared that building the ""China dream"" that Mr. Xi envisions would require erasing China's recent history. ""If we ignore history, what follows will be something even more horrible,"" he said."
News,2018-11-10,"ROME — Rome’s embattled mayor was acquitted on Saturday of charges of lying about a city hall appointment, a case that threatened her career as well as the credibility of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement she represents.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/world/europe/virginia-raggi-rome-mayor-italy.html,469," ROME — Rome's embattled mayor was acquitted on Saturday of charges of lying about a city hall appointment, a case that threatened her career as well as the credibility of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement she represents. A judge found that no crime had been committed when the mayor, Virginia Raggi, appointed the brother of her top aide to a prestigious tourism position at the beginning of her tenure in 2016. ""This sentence wipes away two years of political mud,"" Ms. Raggi told reporters outside Rome's court. ""I am going ahead with our heads high for Rome, my beloved city, and all residents."" Prosecutors had sought a 10-month prison term on charges that Ms. Raggi had lied to anti-corruption officials when they questioned her about the appointment. Ms. Raggi said that the choice was hers alone, while prosecutors argued that it had been orchestrated by her aide. Had Ms. Raggi been convicted, she would have faced the loss of her position as mayor. Under the Five Star Movement's rules, no member convicted of a crime may stay in office, even pending appeal. The verdict was saluted as a victory by Luigi Di Maio, Italy's vice prime minister and the political leader of the Five Star Movement, which governs in an increasingly tense coalition with the anti-immigrant League of Matteo Salvini. ""Happy to always have defended you, and always believed in you,"" Mr. Di Maio wrote in a blog post on the Movement's website. ""The real plague of this country is the vast majority of intellectually and morally corrupt media,"" Mr. Di Maio added. Such journalists were trying to topple the government, he said, with the specific strategy of ""glorifying the League and always butchering the Movement."" The comment betrayed Five Star's difficulty in keeping up with its increasing popular coalition partner. A recent survey showed that Five Star is losing support even as it is rising for the League and Mr. Salvini, the deputy prime minister and interior minister. Mr. Salvini's tough immigration policies and his image of Italy's strongman are appealing to Italian voters: 30 percent would now vote for the League. Political observers noted that, if Ms. Raggi had been made to quit, Mr. Salvini might have tried to take the high-profile position of running Italy's capital for his own party. Regardless of the criminal case against her, Ms. Raggi is under constant pressure over a sense of decay in the city, where basic services like garbage collection are spotty in many neighborhoods and the transportation company is on the constant verge of financial collapse. In the past six months, a bus caught fire in the city center and a metro escalator packed with Russian soccer fans collapsed, wounding dozens. This weekend, Romans vote in a nonbinding referendum on whether they want the city's transportation services to be privatized."

After all, don't we all deserve a ""snuggle lounger"" — whatever that is? Nov. 4–10 The most expensive midterm elections are behind us. So what now, besides a stock market that breathed a sigh of relief? With Democrats in control of the House, the Republicans' promise of future tax cuts look dicey, unless they can compromise by raising corporate taxes to pay for lower rates for the middle class. (President Trump said he'd consider it.) But don't expect much else in the way of bipartisanship. Now that Representative Maxine Waters of California is primed to lead a more hawkish House Financial Services Committee, buckle up for investigations into the President's real estate and financial dealings, starting with his dealings with Deutsche Bank.  Facebook claims to have won its latest battle against fake news. Its ""war room"" of employees working around the clock to fight false news stories collaborated with the F.B.I. last week to thwart a Kremlin-backed group of trolls that had meddled in the 2016 election. As a result, Facebook says, the midterms were relatively free of smear campaigns from foreign entities, at least on its platforms. But are Facebook's efforts sustainable — and are they enough? The network also released an independent report on its role in deadly hate crimes in Myanmar, and admitted that it ""can and should do more"" to prevent ""being used to foment division and incite offline violence."" After a yearlong (and much-publicized) quest to find a home for ""HQ2,"" Amazon may split its second headquarters between two new locations. The two are expected to be New York City — namely, the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens — as well as Crystal City in Arlington, Va. (In other offline news, an Amazon toy catalog — in print! — is scheduled to thump on your doorstep this month.) Meanwhile, Google is quietly buttoning up a deal to grow its Manhattan footprint, potentially adding space for more than 12,000 additional workers. The company also announced an overhaul of its sexual misconduct policy. Nov. 11–17 On Monday, economic leaders from 21 nations will gather for the weeklong Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea. China will have a flashy presence, literally, as it has given tens of millions of dollars for a swish renovation of the summit's convention center, as well as the country's main highway. Mr. Trump, who made his ""America first"" stance clear at last year's APEC meeting, will not attend; instead, he's sending Vice President Mike Pence. Which is just as well, perhaps, since the convention's hottest topics will include trade and climate change, and the president's views on these issues are not winning the United States many friends these days. On Thursday and Friday, the United States International Trade Commission will hold a hearing on the likely impact of his United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on the economy and American consumers. This replacement of Nafta needs congressional approval to pass, which may be tricky now that the Democrats are about to have a majority in the House. The agreement focuses mainly on new rules for exporting cars, dairy products, wine and pharmaceutical drugs, but critics worry that some provisions will backfire. Auto production is one concern: If the deal makes this more expensive, it could raise prices for American car buyers and give incentives to manufacturers to move production elsewhere. The sale of David Hockney's 1972 painting, ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures),"" is estimated to fetch $80 million at a Christie's auction this Thursday. If the bidding does go this high, the piece will become the most expensive work sold by a living artist, a record held by Jeff Koons' ""Balloon Dog"" since 2013, when it sold for $58.4 million. Hockney not your taste? Edward Hopper's ""Chop Suey"" will be at Christie's too, expected to sell for $70 million to $100 million.

Obituary (Obit),2018-11-11,"Ron Johnson, the All-Pro running back who became the first player in Giants history to gain at least 1,000 rushing yards in a season, achieving the milestone twice in the 1970s, died on Saturday at an assisted living facility in Madison, N.J. He was 71.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/obituaries/ron-johnson-dead-giants.html,846," Ron Johnson, the All-Pro running back who became the first player in Giants history to gain at least 1,000 rushing yards in a season, achieving the milestone twice in the 1970s, died on Saturday at an assisted living facility in Madison, N.J. He was 71. His wife, Karen, confirmed the death. Johnson was found to have Alzheimer's disease in 2008. The Giants had only two winning seasons between 1964 and 1980. Both came when Johnson achieved rushing milestones for the franchise. ""When I got to New York, the running backs were Tucker Frederickson and Ernie Koy,"" he recalled in Ken Palmer's ""Game of My Life: Memorable Stories of Giants Football"" (2007). ""They were two white, big fullback-type guys. Everyone assumed that if you were black, you were fast. The Giants never really had anybody like that. So I was very, very well received when I got to New York."" Johnson, 6 feet 1 inches and 205 pounds in his playing days, ran for 1,027 yards and eight touchdowns in 1970, his first season as a Giant. He also had 487 receiving yards, giving him a league-leading 1,514 yards from scrimmage. The Giants went 9-5. and he was voted to the All-Pro first team and the Pro Bowl. ""He's the best halfback in football today — period,"" the Giants' star quarterback Fran Tarkenton told The Associated Press after Johnson caught a touchdown pass, ran for another score and rushed for more than 130 yards in a 23-20 comeback victory over the Dallas Cowboys in November 1970. ""He catches the ball, he blocks, he runs inside and outside, he makes the big plays,"" Tarkenton said. After missing most of the 1971 season with an injury, Johnson ran for 1,182 yards and nine touchdowns in 1972, when he was again chosen for the Pro Bowl. He set a Giants record for touchdowns in a game when he scored three times on passes from Tarkenton's successor, Norm Snead, and once on a run in a victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in October 1972. The Giants went 8-6 that season, then reverted to their losing ways. Johnson was an All-American halfback at Michigan, and he was the first black player to be named a football captain there. He scored 19 rushing touchdowns in the 1968 season, including a five-touchdown, 347-yard game against Wisconsin; all are still university records. As a rookie with the Cleveland Browns, who selected him in the first round of the 1969 draft, he scored seven touchdowns. The Browns traded him to the Giants in 1970 for receiver Homer Jones in a multiplayer deal. For all his achievements in six seasons with the Giants, Johnson was hampered by injuries, and the team did not win so much as a division title. ""I'd like to go anywhere to play for a winner,"" he told The Sarasota Herald Tribune in January 1975. The Giants did not trade him, and he retired following the 1975 season. Ronald Adolphus Johnson, the youngest of five children, was born on Oct. 17, 1947, in Detroit, where his father, Arthur, owned a trucking company, and his mother, Willie Mae, was a homemaker. He was a high school football star and idolized Jim Brown, the Browns' star fullback. Johnson ran for 4,308 yards and 40 touchdowns as a pro and scored another 15 receiving touchdowns. His single-season Giants rushing record stood until 1985, when Joe Morris ran for 1,336 yards. He shares the club record of four touchdowns in a game with running back Rodney Hampton and receiver Earnest Gray. Johnson is survived by his wife; a sister, Jean; a son, Chris; a daughter, Allison; and three grandchildren. His brother Alex, a major league outfielder for 13 seasons, won the 1970 American League batting championship, hitting .329 for the California Angels. Johnson received bachelor's and master's degrees in business from Michigan, worked as a financial analyst for Dean Witter, and then founded the Rackson Corporation, which is based in Totowa, N.J., and New York City and operates fast food outlets in several states. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1992. Fourteen years later, he became the hall's first member to be chairman of the National Football Foundation, which operates it. Johnson's family told The New York Times in 2011 that he had never received a concussion diagnosis and that his mother and a brother also had Alzheimer's disease. But the possible connection between football contact and long-term neurological disability has been a rising concern. Johnson received between $88,000 and $130,000 annually under the 88 Plan, a fund operated by the N.F.L. and its players' union that helps retired players with dementia. He had sustained knee and thigh injuries while playing football and had neck surgery in 1988 to remove two vertebrae. In reflecting on her husband's neurological illness and her fears for him after football, Karen Johnson told The Times in 2011 how ""I was always worried about the appendages."" ""I always thought it would be something physical, something with the knees, arthritis,"" she said. ""This came out of the dark."""

Crowley III are to be married Nov. 11 at the Butterfly Conservatory, Fairchild Garden in Coral Gables, Fla. Ashley Jansen, a friend of the couple who was ordained by the Renewal of the Spirit Institute, is to officiate in a nondenominational ceremony. The bride, who is 62 and will be taking her husband's name, is a Miami-based National Geographic explorer and anthropologist. She graduated from Brigham Young University-Hawaii, and received a Ph.D. in cultural anthropology with a specialization in ethnonavigation from the Union Institute in Cincinnati, through which the majority of her four years of course work was completed at the University of Hawaii, Manoa Campus, Honolulu, and the University of Hawaii, Hilo Campus.

""I was much more interested in a man who didn't define himself by what he did, or what he had."" She was in fact, more interested in ""how he lived, and what his friends thought about him,"" she said. That is why Dr. Lindsey, an explorer by trade, decided to visit Mr. Crowley in Miami before he visited her. ""He offered to come out to Los Angeles but I thought it would be much more revelatory to see him in his own environment,"" she said. ""I did just that, and much like George, I found his friends to be all very quietly accomplished. They were sophisticated, well educated and well traveled, they just didn't talk much about themselves."" Ms. Lindsey was not alone in her search for the perfect mate. ""I was looking for someone who was spiritual, and through her big heart, I could see that Elizabeth's spirituality was palpable,"" Mr. Crowley said. ""She was also an amazingly accomplished woman with great intellect and curiosity.""

News,2018-11-11,The hotel industry is betting that a simple device can help solve the complex problem of guests sexually assaulting and harassing workers.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/us/panic-buttons-hotel-me-too.html,1192," The hotel industry is betting that a simple device can help solve the complex problem of guests sexually assaulting and harassing workers. It's known as a panic button, a small gadget that housekeepers can use to swiftly call for help. The technology takes different forms, including GPS devices that track employees as they walk through the building, buttons that emit an audible alarm and smartphone apps. After a yearlong cascade of stories about the sexual harassment of hotel workers, questions about how to address the problem remain largely unanswered. The most popular solution, one that hotel executives and labor activists can agree on, is small enough to fit in a pocket. Through company policy or legislation pushed by local officials, panic buttons have become increasingly widespread at hotels across the country. But the hotel industry has fiercely resisted measures that would punish the accused, saying that they would threaten guests' due process rights. Juana Melara, a housekeeper in Southern California, believes a panic button could have gotten her out of a frightening situation several years ago when she was working in Cerritos, Calif. Ms. Melara said she was cleaning a bathtub in a hotel room when she turned to see a guest staring at her. She asked him to leave the room and went on her break. When she returned to her housekeeping cart, she said, the man was walking in the hallway toward her with his penis pulled through his pants. ""I was so scared, I said, 'Oh my God, what do I do?'"" Ms. Melara said in an interview. ""The rooms were empty — there were a lot of checkouts on Sunday. There was not anyone who could hear me."" Ms. Melara, 53, said she escaped into a nearby room and locked the door. She called her supervisor and the front desk but said that no one came to the room for about 20 minutes. When she moved to Long Beach, Calif., years later, Ms. Melara continued to work as a housekeeper and began organizing with Unite Here, a union that represents hotel workers that was advocating a law mandating panic buttons at hotels. Statewide legislation failed earlier this year, but on Tuesday, separate ballot measures in Long Beach and Oakland requiring panic buttons at hotels of a certain size passed easily. Over the past year, Seattle has become the main battleground for the industry and the hospitality union's dueling interests. Two years ago, voters approved a ballot measure mandating panic buttons and instituting a system that would place guests accused of sexual misconduct on a blacklist, which would make hotel workers aware of their presence but not bar them. Under the ordinance, if a hotel worker makes a sworn statement accusing a guest of sexual misconduct or if evidence supports the accusation, the guest would be barred from returning to that hotel for three years. If the worker makes the accusation without signing an affidavit, the guest's name will be added to the list for five years. If the worker agrees, the hotel should report the allegations to the police. In late 2016, the American Hotel and Lodging Association, the main trade group representing major hotel chains, and other local trade organizations sued the city over the ordinance. The groups argued that requiring hotel management to bar and blacklist guests would violate guests' due-process rights. ""That told us loud and clear that the industry was more concerned about their guests' comfort level than protecting their employees from sexual harassment,"" said Erik Van Rossum, the president of Unite Here's chapter in the Northwest, which covers Seattle and Portland, Ore. The hotel and lodging association counters that workers' safety is a top priority. But Katherine Lugar, the association's president, said it objected to the ordinance partly because ""we don't believe it's prudent to put a Seattle employee in the position of acting as a surrogate for law enforcement."" In June 2017, a judge ruled in favor of the city, but the trade groups appealed and were back in court arguing their case this month. While the hotel trade group fights these rules, it has embraced panic buttons as worth a significant financial investment. Chicago officials estimated that a hotel security system including panic buttons with tracking capabilities would cost about $100 per room. The lower-tech option that emits an audible alarm is about $25 per device, a Hyatt spokeswoman said. This fall, 17 hotel brands — including major chains like Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott — said they would put the safety devices in place at all their hotels across the country by 2020. Industry groups were not always enthusiastic backers of the devices. Ms. Lugar said the trade association previously had concerns that the hotel union was using worker safety as a ""fig leaf for labor's laundry list of other wants and desires."" Panic buttons were under consideration, and in some places, in operation, before the #MeToo movement, Ms. Lugar said. But the cultural reckoning has clearly played into the industry's calculations. For many years, business leaders rarely prioritized protecting their workers, said Tina Tchen, a lawyer who served as Michelle Obama's chief of staff. Management did only as much as the law required when it came to sexual harassment policies and training, said Ms. Tchen, who advised hotel chains this year on the panic button initiative. ""One of the failings of the past is that we looked at anti-sexual-harassment policies and trainings as one-size-fits-all,"" she said. ""That's why people tuned out."" Before the hotel industry embraced panic buttons, cities including Chicago and Miami Beach, Fla., mandated them through ordinances passed by their city councils. Collective bargaining agreements have also required the devices at union hotels. New York was the first city to require panic buttons on a broad scale when the provision was included in a contract struck in 2012, the year after a hotel housekeeper accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the chief of the International Monetary Fund and a French politician, of sexually assaulting her. Washington, D.C., followed suit with its own agreement. But enacting legislation that includes measures to punish guests has proved difficult in the shadow of Seattle's legal battle. In California and Chicago, the bills initially were supposed to be modeled on Seattle's ordinance, including the provisions on barring and blacklisting certain guests. Later, those provisions were abandoned. Laws in cities including Seattle and Chicago require hotels to maintain sexual harassment policies with procedures to follow if an employee reports harassment by a guest, such as allowing them to temporarily work at a location separate from the alleged harasser. Some hotels are encountering practical challenges as they put the panic button technology in place. Four months after Chicago mandated panic buttons, some small hotels are struggling to pay for the technology, said Alderman Michelle Harris. Larger hotels, she noted, had faced challenges with establishing reliable Wi-Fi connections in every corner of their buildings. In California, Al Muratsuchi, an Assembly member who spearheaded the legislation there, said he had not given up on a statewide law. Although he wants to find a way to punish guests accused of sexual misconduct, he said the panic buttons are the first step."

The first three are board members of MoMA PS1, where Mr. Biesenbach had been director through late October. All four are based in major art capitals outside of California. Mr. Cheng, from Hong Kong, founded the K11 Art Foundation to give Chinese artists a more international platform and serves as a board director of the National Museum of China Foundation and a board member of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, among others. Mr. Mordant, from Sydney, is chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia and a member of the Tate and MoMA International Councils. Ms. Stoschek, from Berlin, a collector of video, performance and other time-based art, is a co-chairman of the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art. Ms. French, from New York, is a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Academy in Berlin. Ms. French has also been involved with MoMA PS1, though not as a trustee. ""She made MoMA PS1 free for New Yorkers for five years in a row,"" said Mr. Biesenbach. Her commitment to free museum admission might come in handy, as Mr. Biesenbach has been seriously considering suggestions from local arts leaders that he take the Museum of Contemporary Art free of charge, along the lines of the city's other contemporary museums, the Broad and the Hammer. But he said he is not rushing into anything, given ""all the implications that free admission could have,"" not just in lost entrance fees but also lost membership revenue and possibly increased staffing and facilities needs. ""I think it needs very careful, responsible evaluation. Fiscal responsibility is very important for this institution — it's definitely factual that the museum's financial problems in the past were life-threatening,"" he said, referring to the museum's near-collapse a decade ago, when its endowment dropped below $10 million. (It now stands around $134 million.) A larger and more supportive board is one safeguard against these sorts of problems. MOCA now has 41 board members, not counting lifetime trustees. Before Mr. Biesenbach's arrival, the latest addition to the board was Sean Parker, a co-founder of Napster and an early Facebook president."

The loudest noise on a recent day was the autumn breeze whistling in the trees. There were a few streets of stone houses, a 13th-century church, one baker and not much else. So it may come as a surprise that late last year, Mr. Gentilhomme wrote a letter to President Emmanuel Macron telling him that the stress was too much and that he was quitting. He could not stand watching his village of 400 wither anymore. ""After 30 years, I've had enough,"" wrote Mr. Gentilhomme, a vigorous 77-year-old former French Navy SEAL diver. ""The compromises, the unkept promises and the state's withdrawal have used me up, morally and physically.'' His letter speaks to a broader anxiety in France's heartland. This year, like him, more than 150 of the country's mayors, mostly rural, have quit. The number of mayors quitting their posts may be at an all-time high, up anywhere from 32 percent to 50 percent over the previous electoral cycle, according to the French news media. The resignations provide an echo of the larger clash taking place in France today between Mr. Macron's drive to shake up the country's sometimes archaic institutions, untouched for centuries, and a way of life that may no longer be sustainable. [Read about Mr. Macron warning this past week of the dangers of nationalism as he hosted world leaders to commemorate the end of World War I 100 years ago on Sunday.] It is in villages where the president's ambition to pare back the government most squarely runs up against French traditions and expectations — one of which is that the state provides services and should make its authority felt in even the quietest corners. That has long been the role of the village mayor, as much a French specialty as the 17th-century castle that graces Mr. Gentilhomme's tiny territory, and almost as anachronistic. Mayors have been a mainstay of French life since the revolutionaries of 1789 decreed that wherever a church steeple arises — even if only a few houses are clustered around it — there should be a mayor. It has remained this way ever since. No country on the Continent surpasses France's 35,502 mayors, who make up 40 percent of all the mayors in the European Union. Twenty thousand of these towns have fewer than 500 inhabitants. But even before Mr. Macron came to office in May 2017, France was confronting the question of whether it could still afford so many little fiefs, which were already straining under cost cutting and administrative ""regroupings."" Under a 2015 law, small towns were ordered to combine into administrative units of at least 15,000 people, where 5,000 had been the previous benchmark. Real power — to handle economic development, to manage water, even to raise taxes — passed to the new clusters. Now the young president has accelerated that drive toward even more administrative efficiency. ""In the era of the internet, fast transport and cuts in local funding, it makes sense for these towns to group themselves together to confront these new challenges,"" said Jean-René Cazeneuve, a Macron deputy in the French Parliament who is studying why so many mayors are resigning. ""It's Emmanuel Macron who wants to speed things up, who wants to reform,"" Mr. Cazeneuve said. ""And that could make local officials feel uneasy about their future."" No doubt it has. More mayors are shedding the sash that denotes their authority, as the appeal of presiding over the tricolor flag that flutters outside every mairie, or town hall, is not what it used to be. ""There's something going on,"" said Christian Le Bart, an expert in local government at Sciences Po university in Rennes. ""They have the impression of being abandoned by the state, and of being more and more criticized by their citizens."" The departures — a small fraction of the total, to be sure — reflect the struggle of villages in rural France to remain alive while trapped in a spiral of shrinking revenues and declining populations. But the cure, the mayors say, has steadily left them with less money and less authority, but with no fewer burdens. ""We do everything,"" said Jean-Claude Bellini, who recently quit as mayor of nearby Chaux. ""It's always, 'call the mayor, call the mayor.'"" Indeed, experts say, even with the regroupings and the cuts, there is a logic — a very French logic — in keeping the mayor in city hall. ""Their reason for being is proximity,"" said Matthieu Leprince, an economics professor and expert on local finance at the University of Western Brittany in Brest. ""They know the turf."" That has made the quiet revolt among France's mayors — whose ears are closest to the citizen's mouth — an important measure of grass-roots resistance to Mr. Macron's reform drive. The resistance comes at a time where Mr. Macron is looking to position himself as the leader of Europe and the chief defender of its liberal values, as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany prepares to exit the stage. National polls show his support dwindling, most strikingly in the ""deep France"" of the provinces. Mr. Macron is considered the president of France's thriving big cities, not its left-behind periphery. But money has its own logic, too, and funds from Paris have dropped sharply over the last two years, Mr. Gentilhomme said. Overall, the state's contribution to France's towns has dropped to 30 billion euros, or about $34 billion, in 2017, when Mr. Macron was elected, from 42 billion euros in 2014. At the same time, Mr. Macron has vowed to cut a main source of local revenue, the lodging tax, which brings in a total of 22 billion euros annually, or about $25 billion, and makes up 10 percent of the average village's budget. The tax is paid by anyone who owns, rents or lives in a home or apartment — just about everyone in France — and Mr. Macron's pledge to get rid of it was one of his most popular campaign promises. While that promises to lighten the tax load on local residents, it has made the mayors — who booed Mr. Macron at their meeting last year — particularly furious. The president has said he will make up the shortfall, but mayors are distrustful that he will. ""There's a real threat to the financial autonomy of these towns,"" said Ludovic Rochette, who heads the mayor's association in the Côte d'Or department in Burgundy.  The mayors, he said, had long felt disrespected by the authorities in Paris, but they had hoped for a change with Mr. Macron. ""We thought that with him, finally, there would be dialogue between Paris and the territories,"" Mr. Rochette said. ""But cutting out the lodging tax was the last straw. And we've all cut and cut, and now we're down to the bone."" Aware of the frustration, Mr. Macron last month beefed up his local affairs ministry, vowing more attentiveness. But that was too late for mayors like Mr. Gentilhomme. Where he lives in the Côte d'Or, the heart of Burgundy's legendary wine country, the local mayor's association says resignations have increased 52 percent over the period from 2008 to 2014. ""My struggle for the survival of our countryside was misunderstood, and barely supported,"" Mr. Gentilhomme wrote the president. The short letter back from Mr. Macron was signed, but that was the only human touch. It spoke dryly of ""institutional stability"" and promised to simplify the administrative regroupings. But that consolidation was exactly what Mr. Gentilhomme had fought against, as he was pushed from a regrouping of 11 villages into one of 26. Mr. Cazeneuve, the parliamentary deputy, thinks the consolidations could be a prime reason behind the resignation wave — an end to the distinctive French dream of being king of one's own small domain. ""It's better to be first in the village than second in Rome,"" he said. But second, even in the village, is another thing entirely. ""I walked to the mairie every day,"" Mr. Gentilhomme said. ""And they didn't hesitate to call out to me, or even to come to the house. They think the mayor can do everything."" ""'There's no water, there's no electricity, so, it's got be the mayor,'"" he said, mimicking the complaints that came piling down. ""On your own turf, people think you are the good Lord,"" Mr. Gentilhomme said. ""But in reality, you can't do much of anything."""
News,2018-11-11,Shane Parrish was a cybersecurity expert at Canada’s top intelligence agency and an occasional blogger when he noticed something curious about his modest readership six years ago: 80 percent of his followers worked on Wall Street.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/business/intelligence-expert-wall-street.html,1403," Shane Parrish was a cybersecurity expert at Canada's top intelligence agency and an occasional blogger when he noticed something curious about his modest readership six years ago: 80 percent of his followers worked on Wall Street. The blog was meant to be a method of self-improvement, helping Mr. Parrish deal with a job whose pressures had increased with the growing threat of global hacking. But his lonely riffs — on how learning deeply, thinking widely and reading books strategically could improve decision-making skills — had found an eager audience among hedge fund titans and mutual fund executives, many of whom were still licking their wounds after the financial crisis. ""People just found us,"" Mr. Parrish said. ""We became a thing on Wall Street."" His website, Farnam Street, urges visitors to ""Upgrade Yourself."" In saying as much, Mr. Parrish is promoting strategies of rigorous self-betterment as opposed to classic self-help fare — which appeals to his overachieving audience in elite finance, Silicon Valley and professional sports. His many maxims cite Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bertrand Russell and even Frank Zappa. (""A mind is like a parachute. It doesn't work if it is not open."") Today, Mr. Parrish's community of striving financiers is clamoring for more of him. That means calling on him to present his thoughts and book ideas to employees and clients; attending his regular reading and think weeks in Hawaii, Paris and the Bahamas; and in some cases hiring him to be their personal decision-making coach. ""These guys are driven to get that incremental edge — they are competitive, gladiatorial in that respect,"" said Mr. Parrish, 39. ""We are trying to get people to ask themselves better questions and reflect. If you can do that, you will be better able to handle the speed and variety of changing environments."" To do that, Mr. Parrish advises investors like Scott Miller, the founder of Greenhaven Road Capital, to disconnect from the noise and read deeply. ""I will leave my computer and go into a separate room to read,"" said Mr. Miller, an early sponsor of Farnam Street who is currently reading ""Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones,"" by James Clear. ""It feels weird to do this in the middle of the day — but I do it."" Mr. Parrish's site has drawn the attention of some of the biggest names in finance. Dan Loeb, one of the more prominent hedge fund executives on Wall Street, is a big fan. And Ray Dalio of Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund, recently did a podcast with him. ""Shane is a special person,"" Mr. Loeb said via email. Few Wall Street obsessions surpass the pursuit of an investment edge. In an earlier era, before computers and the internet, this advantage was largely brain power: Warren Buffett plucking a nugget from an annual report or George Soros making a seismic bet against a currency. Today, information is just another commodity. And the edge belongs to algorithms, data sets and funds that track indexes and countless other investment themes. This has been devastating for hedge fund and mutual fund managers who make their living trying to outsmart the stock market. With their business models under attack, they are searching for answers. And Mr. Parrish has a simple solution: reading, reflection and lifelong learning. ""These days, if you are not getting better you are falling behind,"" said Mr. Parrish, who is reading ""The Laws of Human Nature,"" an examination of human behavior that draws on examples of historical figures by Robert Greene. ""Reading is a way to consume people's experiences, to learn something timeless and then apply it to your life."" Chuck Royce, the founder and former chief executive officer of Royce mutual funds, who oversees $4 billion in investments, said he stumbled on Mr. Parrish's site and related to it immediately. Mr. Royce developed a reputation as one of the industry's most astute fund managers, specializing in small, high-quality companies in the 1970s. But in the recent period of low interest rates, his main mutual fund's performance has suffered. ""I failed to understand that in this period of zero rates, inferior companies would outperform high-quality companies,"" said Mr. Royce, who was part of a group that spent a long weekend talking books and big ideas with Mr. Parrish in Hawaii two years ago. Mr. Royce has embraced Mr. Parrish's core principles. He gets up at 5:30 every morning to do his daily reading, which currently includes ""Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Bets When you Don't Have All the Cards"" by Annie Duke, a former poker champion — and a big favorite among investors these days. At the office, Mr. Royce works from a couch strewn with papers. His Bloomberg terminal is in another room. ""It is all about habits,"" Mr. Royce said. ""Setting goals is easy — but without good habits you are not getting there."" Some executives have long sought insight from the printed page — and not just in the business section. Emmanuel Roman, the chief executive officer of the bond giant Pimco — who is reading ""On Grand Strategy,"" an assessment of the decisions of notable historical leaders by the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer John Lewis Gaddis — called reading ""a pure passion."" And Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman of Goldman Sachs, has talked up the benefits of reading books, especially those not related to economics or finance. Mr. Parrish is an unlikely guru, a computer scientist from Halifax, Nova Scotia, who seems bemused by his sudden cachet. On a recent swing through New York to meet with clients, Mr. Parrish was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts and carried a worn backpack. Slight and balding, he looked more like an unhurried graduate student than a counselor to some of the wealthiest executives on Wall Street. Mr. Parrish joined the Communications Security Establishment, a division of Canada's Defence Department, straight out of college. His first day was Aug. 28, 2001, and he was soon promoted in the tumult that followed the Sept. 11 attacks. Suddenly, he was managing a large staff at the age of 24. Wanting to improve his decision-making skills, Mr. Parrish found inspiration in Charlie Munger — Warren Buffett's longtime investment partner. Mr. Parrish quickly became an acolyte, drawn to Mr. Munger's thoughts on multidisciplinary thinking and mental models. He pored over Berkshire Hathaway annual reports and became a regular attendee of Mr. Buffett's yearly meetings in Omaha. The name of his site is another tribute to the billionaire investor: Berkshire Hathaway's address in Omaha is 3555 Farnam Street. Last year, Mr. Parrish left intelligence work to tend to the site full time. He would not disclose how much his various projects were making. Farnam Street now consists of book lists, essays, podcasts and a vibrant social network — all of which are anchored by Mr. Parrish's self-improvement musings. There are also branded goodies to be had, such as a decision-making journal and a Farnam Street thinking cap. Some 190,000 people have signed up to Brain Food, his free weekly newsletter. Mr. Parrish's more dedicated followers pay $250 a year to become part of his ""knowledge community"" — a premium site with a private discussion forum and additional content. They have flocked to his social network, trading book ideas and meet-up suggestions in Toronto, Dubai and London. James Aitken, an independent investment adviser in London who counsels some of the world's largest investors, was among the readers that came upon Mr. Parrish in 2012. Since then, Mr. Aitken has revamped his work habits, pushing himself to disconnect from all his screens and read books — ideally for at least two hours a day. ""He is so indispensable to me that, beyond becoming a part of his network, I will occasionally write him a check at the end of the year,"" Mr. Aitken said. Mr. Aitken now pushes his clients to increase the time they spend reading and thinking away from their screens. Twice a year he sends out a list of books — including history, biography, finance and economics, self-help, and more — from which clients can choose a number of books as gifts. He has sent out about 2,300 over the past 10 years. ""Every world-class investor is questioning right now how they can improve,"" he said. ""So, in a machine-driven age where everything is driven by speed, perhaps the edge is judgment, time and perspective."""
News,2018-11-11,"Three wildfires in California have displaced hundreds of thousands of people and destroyed thousands of homes. So far, dozens of people have been confirmed dead and hundreds more are missing.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/reader-center/california-fires-how-to-help.html,724," Three wildfires in California have displaced hundreds of thousands of people and destroyed thousands of homes. So far, dozens of people have been confirmed dead and hundreds more are missing. Vast expanses of land have been scorched in Northern California by the Camp Fire — the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history — and in Southern California by the Woolsey and Hill Fires. Here's how you can help. Remember to do your research on a charity's reputation for using donations effectively. Charity Navigator is a good source to consult. Also, remember that sending money is almost always the most efficient way to help in a disaster, according to the Center for International Disaster Information, part of the United States Agency for International Development. If volunteers on the ground end up with a mountain of donated goods, they'll have to spend time sorting through them rather than buying exactly what's needed. American Red Cross: This nonprofit has opened shelters across the state to help evacuees. They also have an online tool that people can use to register themselves as safe so loved ones can find them. California Community Foundation's Wildfire Relief Fund: For 15 years, the foundation has offered aid to those affected by wildfires. Grants have gone to rebuilding homes, providing financial and mental health assistance and helping those affected to get medical treatment. California Fire Foundation: This organization is on the ground distributing financial assistance to people who have lost everything in the fires. Through its emergency assistance program, firefighters distribute pre-paid gift cards to help those who need to purchase necessities like food, medicine and clothing. Caring Choices: This nonprofit, which is in Chico, Calif., has turned into a hub for organizing volunteers to help those affected by the Camp Fire. Volunteers are assigned a variety of duties, including caring for displaced animals and, for those who are certified doctors or nurses, offering medical care. The organization has paused taking on new volunteers for the next few days but still encourages applications. It said it will need extra hands in the coming weeks. Caring Choices is also seeking monetary donations for its operations. Enloe Medical Center: This 298-bed hospital is in Chico, the site of multiple evacuation centers for the Camp Fire. It is accepting donations for patients and families who have been displaced. Entertainment Industry Foundation: This nonprofit, started by Hollywood stars, has a fund that helps firefighters and other emergency workers battling California wildfires. One of its beneficiaries is the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation, which provides hydration backpacks and night vision goggles for helicopter pilots. Humane Society of Ventura County: This nonprofit is accepting donations to help animals displaced by the Woolsey and Hill Fires. It is taking in domestic animals, such as dogs, cats and birds, as well as livestock. North Valley Community Foundation: This nonprofit in Chico is raising money to support organizations that are sheltering evacuees of the Camp Fire. These could include churches, fairgrounds and community centers, said Logan Todd, a foundation spokesman. Salvation Army: At both ends of the state, the Salvation Army is providing meals to shelters in local churches, fairgrounds and a community college. United Way of Greater Los Angeles: This local branch of the national organization is raising money for those affected by the Woolsey and Hill Fires, specifically to help low-income residents. United Way of Northern California: This local chapter of the national nonprofit has established a disaster relief fund to offer emergency cash and help to people who have lost their homes, according to a news release. There are multiple crowdfunding efforts for victims of the California fires. GoFundMe has organized a page that catalogs the relief efforts in Northern and Southern California. It includes links to donate to families who have lost their homes. Google is collecting donations to help those affected by the wildfires in Southern California. It will funnel the donations to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, which will distribute the money to local nonprofits. Additionally, Airbnb has launched a program that asks people to open their homes to those affected by the fires. Until Nov. 29, the company is allowing residents to mark their homes as a place for evacuees and aid workers to stay for free."
News,2018-11-29,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/reader-center/ceos-mindfulness-meditation.html,821," Illustration by Jack Sachs Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. As the Corner Office columnist and a business reporter, it's my job to stay in touch with chief executive officers around the country. We usually talk about what's going on at their companies, or what's happening in Washington. But sometimes, we chat about meditation. Yes, that's right: meditation. I've been practicing mindfulness meditation for 20 years now, sometimes writing about it for The Times. And recently, mindfulness has become increasingly popular in the business world. While a few years ago the subject was somewhat taboo to discuss at work, with skeptics dismissing meditation as a frivolous pursuit, these days, some C.E.O.s take pride in the practice. Since I took over the Corner Office column this year, the subject has already come up in several interviews. Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, has installed meditation rooms throughout Salesforce Tower in San Francisco, and often hosts Buddhist monks at his house. When I asked him how his meditation practice had informed his leadership style, he responded in what almost sounded like a koan. ""Having a beginner's mind informs my management style,"" he said. ""I'm trying to listen deeply, and the beginner's mind is informing me to step back, so that I can create what wants to be, not what was. I know that the future does not equal the past. I know that I have to be here in the moment."" Mark T. Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna, was severely injured in a skiing accident in 2004 and used meditation to help him get back to work. After experiencing the benefits of meditation firsthand, he started offering mindfulness classes to Aetna employees, and before long, he said, the corporate culture had changed. ""We're different now,"" he told me. ""Everybody started coming to me with ideas about how we could be better."" Eileen Fisher, the designer, didn't overtly mention meditation and mindfulness when I interviewed her for Corner Office. But it was implicit. I had met Ms. Fisher years earlier through meditation circles, and knew that her interest in mindfulness had led her to improve the working conditions for factory workers in China and offer more generous benefits for employees in New York. And Mark Hoplamazian, the chief executive of Hyatt Hotels, who has dabbled in meditation, spoke about the importance of empathy and mindfulness to his strategy. ""In order to practice empathy, you have to be present, and one great vehicle to being present is to be mindful,"" he told me. ""Mindfulness became the central element of our wellness investment."" These C.E.O.s are not alone in embracing mindfulness. Today, plenty of other companies, including Google, Ford and McKinsey, are offering meditation programs in the office. Though it may be surprising to some that C.E.O.s are so enthusiastic about meditation, it's a movement I've been chronicling for years now. In 2012, I wrote an article for The Financial Times, where I was then a reporter, about General Mills' efforts to introduce mindfulness to employees. That led to a book deal, and in 2015, I published ""Mindful Work: How Meditation Is Changing Business From the Inside Out."" My own meditation practice goes back further than that. After reading a book about Buddhism in college, I started practicing Zen meditation. My curiosity was piqued, and I spent my junior year of college in India, first through the Antioch Buddhist Studies program, and then traveling on my own. For the better part of a year, I roamed the country, living in monasteries, going on 10-day silent meditation retreats and learning from Buddhist teachers. In a matter of months, mindfulness meditation was making me less stressed, more patient and even a bit kinder. Since then, my meditation practice has ebbed and flowed, though the benefits have remained the same. There are stretches during which I diligently make time to sit on my cushion every day, quietly observing my thoughts, emotions and sensations. Then I'll go awhile without any formal practice. Then I'll go on retreat again, as I did this spring, going off the grid for days at a time. My writing about meditation for The Times is similarly sporadic. I've published three guides for the Well section (How to Meditate, Mindfulness for Children and How to Be More Mindful at Work). But ever since a weekly column, Meditation for Real Life, ended last year, we haven't had a regular feature on the topic. These days, my meditation coverage mostly turns up in the Corner Office, where, even when a C.E.O. isn't specifically talking about meditation, the answers to my questions are often informed by the practice of mindfulness. When I asked Mr. Benioff whether companies had a responsibility to benefit society, his response might as well have come out of a Buddhist scripture. ""This company is not somehow separate from everything else,"" he said. ""Are we not all connected? Are we not all one?""

News,2018-11-29,"WASHINGTON — Escalating his attacks on the special counsel investigation, President Trump said on Wednesday that a presidential pardon for his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort is “not off the table,” casting him and other subjects of the inquiry as victims of prosecutorial abuse.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/us/politics/trump-pardon-paul-manafort.html,1362," WASHINGTON — Escalating his attacks on the special counsel investigation, President Trump said on Wednesday that a presidential pardon for his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort is ""not off the table,"" casting him and other subjects of the inquiry as victims of prosecutorial abuse. Although Mr. Trump had not discussed a pardon for Mr. Manafort, ""I wouldn't take it off the table,"" he said in an Oval Office interview with The New York Post. ""Why would I take it off the table?"" He said that prosecutors for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had poorly treated Mr. Manafort, who was convicted of eight felonies this summer and pleaded guilty to two more. Though Mr. Trump is given to loose promises that go unfulfilled, the suggestion of a pardon was nonetheless remarkable. It came as his rhetorical attacks on Mr. Mueller have grown increasingly provocative — the president tweeted on Wednesday that prosecutors were ""viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts & they will get relief"" — and as leading Republican senators again thwarted an effort to protect Mr. Mueller from being fired. The president's declaration also capped a turn of events for Mr. Manafort, who was a cooperating witness for Mr. Mueller until prosecutors declared this week that he had lied to them in breach of his plea agreement. They were said to be frustrated in part because one of his lawyers was updating Mr. Trump's legal team about the case. By leaving open the possibility of pardoning a former aide whose lawyer was a source of inside information about an investigation into Mr. Trump himself, the president showed a new willingness to publicly signal that he will intervene to protect people who are in the special counsel's cross hairs. And though the president's advisers have previously dangled the possibility of pardons before targets of the special counsel's inquiry, pardoning Mr. Manafort could be politically risky for Mr. Trump. Before he pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges in September, Mr. Manafort was convicted of financial fraud after a lengthy jury trial. He now faces at least 10 years in prison. Despite prosecutors' declaration that Mr. Manafort had lied to them, Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Manafort had instead refused to make false statements that would advance the special counsel's investigation. He said Jerome Corsi, a conservative author, had also been pressured to lie and defended Roger Stone Jr., a former Trump campaign adviser and longtime friend of the president's whom the special counsel is investigating. transcript Paul Manafort was once President Trump's campaign manager. By the fall of 2018, he was expected to face at least a decade in prison for 10 felony counts. Those counts included financial fraud and conspiracy to obstruct justice. ""Mr. Manafort is disappointed of not getting acquittals all the way through. He is evaluating all of his options at this point."" In the hopes of getting a more lenient punishment, Manafort agreed to fully cooperate with the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Now, federal prosecutors are saying he violated his plea deal by repeatedly lying during their investigation. Manafort's lawyer also allegedly passed information to President Trump's legal team. But this isn't Manafort's first scandal. Controversy has trailed the veteran Republican adviser since his earliest work as an international lobbyist and consultant. In the 1980s, Manafort testified before Congress and admitted to using his political influence to win millions of dollars in contracts from federal low-income housing programs. ""The technical term for what we do and what law firms, associations and professional groups do is lobbying. For purposes of today, I will admit that in a narrow sense some people might term it influence peddling."" That same decade, Manafort advised the Philippine dictator, Ferdinand Marcos, on improving his image in the U.S. Manafort allegedly received $10 million in cash from a Marcos confidante. It was apparently money intended for Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign. But the campaign said it never received that money. Foreign contributions to U.S. presidential elections are illegal. Also in the 1980s, Manafort was linked to the prime minister of the Bahamas at a time when the island nation had alleged ties to drug traffickers. Manafort's company said that the goal of its work was to help the Bahamas obtain more U.S. aid to help curb the drug smuggling. Decades later, Manafort would run Trump's presidential campaign. ""We want America to understand who Donald Trump the man is. Not just Donald Trump the candidate. The composite of his career. Not just from a business standpoint or a political standpoint, from a human standpoint as well."" But he resigned five months into the job in August 2016, in the wake of reports that he received more than $12 million from Viktor Yanukovich, the former Ukrainian president and pro-Russia politician. Yanukovich and his political party relied on advice from Manafort and his firm, which helped them win several elections. The Times uncovered that Manafort and others close to Trump met with the Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer in June 2016. That lawyer claimed to have damaging political information about Hillary Clinton. As for this latest brush with controversy, Manafort's lawyers insist that their client has been truthful. But they acknowledge that Manafort and Mueller's team are at an impasse. ""It's actually very brave,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I'm telling you this is McCarthyism. We are in the McCarthy era. This is no better than McCarthy."" Mr. Corsi, whom Mr. Trump singled out in his interview with The Post, has said he expects to be indicted on charges of lying to federal prosecutors, but as yet faces none. Federal prosecutors have yet to interview Mr. Stone, despite Mr. Trump's claim that they demanded he lie to help them. The president's latest broadsides against the special counsel have prompted renewed efforts by some senators to force a vote on a measure that would protect Mr. Mueller and future special counsels from being fired for political reasons. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said that given the president's now near-daily attacks on Mr. Mueller, ""to be so sanguine about the chances of him getting fired is folly for us."" But for the second time in two weeks, a prominent Republican on Wednesday blocked the measure. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, called it unnecessary. ""The president's not going to fire Robert Mueller,"" he said. ""Nor do I think he should."" Mr. Trump ordered Mr. Mueller fired at least twice last year but never followed through. The president's view of the special counsel's inquiry into Russia's 2016 election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired is shaped in part by what his lawyers have heard from defense lawyers representing subjects or witnesses who are interacting with prosecutors. His lawyers were particularly alarmed by developments suggesting that investigators were trying to home in on whether anyone connected to the Trump campaign interacted with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, according to people familiar with the situation. Russian agents hacked Democratic computers and funneled tens of thousands of emails and other documents to WikiLeaks to distribute in order to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign. Especially troubling to the president's legal team was a reference to the president in a draft criminal complaint against Mr. Corsi, the conservative author and ally of Mr. Stone's, for allegedly lying to investigators. The draft complaint, which was passed on to Mr. Trump's team, said that Mr. Corsi was aware that Mr. Stone was in touch with Mr. Trump and senior members of the Trump campaign when Mr. Stone asked him to ""get to Assange"" in the summer of 2016. That coincided with the revelation that Mr. Assange had been secretly charged by the Justice Department on counts that remain sealed. Fearful that prosecutors were laying some kind of trap for the president, Mr. Trump's lawyers refused to turn over written answers to questions after negotiating over them with the special counsel for nearly a year. Only after Mr. Mueller's team provided fresh assurances of their intentions did they hand them over last week. Having delivered the president's responses, members of his circle appeared eager to try to show that Mr. Trump's answers put him in the clear. On Wednesday, CNN reported that the president told the special counsel he did not discuss WikiLeaks with Mr. Stone. For his part, Mr. Stone has said he was not a conduit of information from the organization to anyone in the campaign. The president also said, as he has publicly, that he did not know about a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that included Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who was expected to deliver damaging information about Mrs. Clinton, the network reported. Roger J. Stone Jr., one of six Trump advisers convicted in cases stemming from the investigation by the special counsel, was sentenced to more than three years in prison. After languishing for more than a year, the Senate bill to protect Mr. Mueller picked up some momentum once Mr. Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, transferring oversight of the Mueller investigation to the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, one of its most vocal critics. Proponents of the measure said that they planned to keep pushing for a floor vote through the remainder of this session of Congress, which adjourns next month. Democrats are trying, for example, to add the bill to must-pass year-end government spending legislation, but whether such a proposal could survive negotiations with Republicans is highly uncertain. Mr. Flake has pledged to vote against any Trump administration nominee until the bill gets a vote, and signs have emerged in recent days that his tactic could be working. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's second-highest-ranking Republican, alluded to Mr. Flake's promise on Tuesday as his office assessed support for the bill. ""If we can have a relatively expedited up-or-down vote — and my preference is that it fail — but at least he will have had his shot,"" Mr. Cornyn said on the conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt's radio show. ""And my hope is that he then will agree to let us confirm the judges that are on the calendar,"" he said, referring to Mr. Flake. The legislation is intended to ensure that special counsels like Mr. Mueller can be removed from office by the Justice Department only for good cause. Most notably, it would establish a 10-day window within which a special counsel could petition a panel of federal judges to determine whether a firing was justified. If the panel determined it was not, the counsel would be promptly reinstated. The legislation would also ensure that the special counsel's staff and investigative materials are preserved while the review takes place. Senators from both parties introduced similar bills in the summer of 2017, and the Senate Judiciary Committee passed one measure with bipartisan support in April. But Mr. McConnell or other prominent Republicans have blocked a vote. Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who stopped proponents' efforts to move the measure to the floor on Wednesday, said it would make special counsels so powerful that they would constitute ""a de facto fourth branch of government."""
News,2018-11-29,"Adam McKay strode through his backyard one recent afternoon to show me the exact spot where, last January, a heart attack nearly killed him. An enormous pizza floatie drifted along the edge of his swimming pool, yellow cheese aglow in the Los Angeles sun, as McKay pointed to some exercise equipment. “We’re out here, working out,” he recalled, “and all of a sudden my hands start getting tingly and I’m feeling really queasy.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/magazine/adam-mckay-dick-cheney-vice.html,6142," Adam McKay strode through his backyard one recent afternoon to show me the exact spot where, last January, a heart attack nearly killed him. An enormous pizza floatie drifted along the edge of his swimming pool, yellow cheese aglow in the Los Angeles sun, as McKay pointed to some exercise equipment. ""We're out here, working out,"" he recalled, ""and all of a sudden my hands start getting tingly and I'm feeling really queasy."" McKay made his name as a filmmaker in the early 2000s with a string of hit comedies that included ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights."" But since co-writing and directing a 2015 adaptation of Michael Lewis's financial-crash caper ""The Big Short,"" which earned him an Oscar for screenwriting, he has gravitated to more serious material. His new movie, ""Vice,"" is a grim account of the life of Dick Cheney, with Christian Bale — smoldering beneath prosthetic jowls and the ample weight he gained for the role — in the lead. McKay went into it aware that it would be, as he put it to me, ""the most challenging, ambitious movie"" he ever made. ""The movie was big,"" he said. His shooting script encompassed five decades of Cheney's life, 200 locations and more than 150 speaking parts. Chief among McKay's coping mechanisms for stress, going back to his 20s, were cigarettes and junk food, and during the ""Vice"" shoot, he averaged half a pack of American Spirit Ultra Lights a day and put on around 25 pounds. When filming was through, McKay, who is 50, booked time with a trainer he'd hired before. He came over for a session in mid-January. It was then that McKay's stomach turned. ""My trainer says, 'Are you O.K.?' And I'm, like: 'Yeah, yeah, I'm just in bad shape. I'm worn out. I'm still smoking.' "" The trainer decided not to push it and left. Just then, McKay remembered that Bale, when researching Cheney's several heart attacks in preparation for ""Vice,"" ""met with a heart surgeon, and he said: 'There's a lot of ways you can show a heart attack. The hands tingling is one, the most common one is the pain in the arm, but what's really common is queasiness.' And in that moment, I ran upstairs."" McKay swallowed three baby aspirin and called his wife, who called 911. At the hospital, a doctor confirmed the bad news: He'd had a heart attack. The good news was that they were opening him up, inserting a stent and, if McKay quit smoking and got into better shape, he'd come out fine. One of his two daughters brought him a card at the hospital that read, ""Congratulations on Your New Baby!"" which she'd modified to say, ""I'm Sorry about Your New Heart Attack!"" ""So I'm 100 percent O.K.,"" McKay said. ""I do get a little lightheaded sometimes, but I recovered. It's like in 'Jaws,' when the shark swims right past the kid and doesn't touch him."" He grinned. ""And then about two days later, I called Bale and I said, 'Hey man, either you or Dick Cheney saved my life.' "" This is as close as McKay is likely to come to expressing good will toward the 46th vice president. Far from a grateful tribute, ""Vice"" — which co-stars Amy Adams as Cheney's wife, Lynne — proceeds in a spirit of frenetic and ferocious irreverence. Annapurna, the company behind the film, spent about $60 million to make it, and executives there are positioning the movie, as they did last year with ""Phantom Thread,"" as a major awards-season contender. But McKay had little interest in obeying the familiar rhythms of the academy-pleasing biopic that Cheney's story might have inspired. In previous features, McKay staged the murder of a man by an airborne trident; filmed a prosthetic scrotum in close-up bobbing atop a snare drum; and enlisted Margot Robbie to explain subprime mortgages from a bubble bath. And yet ""Vice"" is, in tone and form, one of the wildest movies he has made — and one of the wildest movies ever made about politics, period. A filmmaker less restive than McKay, having cast actors as gifted as Bale and Adams, might have done his best impersonation of, say, Steven Spielberg directing ""Lincoln"" — filling his movie with so much solemn soliloquizing and rousing Oval Office debate. But in ""Vice,"" scenes of finely wrought drama give way to passages of surreally heightened satire, which in turn give way to horrible vérité footage of ""enhanced interrogations."" The movie doesn't only double and triple back on itself but is punctuated throughout with nature-documentary clips, the ""Whassup!"" beer commercial and a variety of self-reflexive feints. The film's narrator is Jesse Plemons, whose relationship to Cheney is mysterious: at points he is a soldier, at others a warehouse worker, and at others, Naomi Watts, playing a cable-news anchor, is suddenly narrating instead. What is unambiguous, by the end, is McKay's conviction that the American right, in its post-Reagan consolidation of power, has set our country and our planet on a path to ruin — and that no single figure illustrates this better than Cheney. ""He was the expert safecracker who opened up the safe,"" McKay said, alluding to Cheney's deft dismantling of checks on executive power, ""and now the orangutan is in there, throwing around the money and the jewels."" McKay knows that a conservative backlash to his film is very likely, and while he emphasized how diligently he grounded the film in research, he also argued that making a less confrontational movie, hewing to a measured realism would have felt not only boring but also incommensurate to the task. ""I've never dealt with a tone like this, and I don't think it's by accident,"" McKay said. ""We're living in a world with a tone that none of us has ever experienced. Pipe bombs are being sent to the leaders of a political party, and the guy who made 'Dilbert' is saying, You know the bombs were really made by left-wingers because they didn't work."" He made an incredulous face. ""So, you're claiming the assassination attempts are a false flag operation while slamming the liberals and you're the guy who did 'Dilbert'?"" When it came to the movie's protean tone, he said, ""All I can tell you is that we were very conscious of it, we knew it was challenging and indefinable — and we knew it had to be."" This was true, he added, not in spite of the material's seriousness, but because of it. ""I'm suspicious of anything that feels like an old form,"" he said. ""We're discovering new styles and forms, because this era we're in demands it. The world has gotten so cartoonishly exaggerated and over the top. Why be subtle anymore?"" In certain ways, McKay is vulnerable to caricature as a ""Hollywood liberal."" He lives with his wife of 19 years, the film and theater director Shira Piven, and their daughters in an old, mansion-studded part of town. They own a five-bedroom, cedar-shingled home outfitted with solar panels and shielded from the street by hedges some 12 feet tall. He drives a Tesla, which was charging out front. But like many self-identifying progressives, McKay — who grew up on food stamps and was raised in suburban Pennsylvania by his waitress single mother (his father, a musician, left the family when McKay was 7) — has grown steadily disenchanted with what he calls ""the corporate left."" This summer he joined the L.A. chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. He thinks that capitalism must come under greater, Scandinavian-style regulatory control, ""especially if we're going to do anything about climate change."" Earlier this year he left Funny or Die, a comedy website he co-founded in 2007, after it entered into a sponsored-content agreement with Shell, a deal he called ""disgusting."" McKay stands at a towering 6-foot-5 and sometimes seems to have more body than he knows what to do with. In his home office, he arranged himself across a beige couch like a coat hurled off in a hurry: torso horizontal, head kinked up against a pillow, legs crossed off the front. The room was trimmed in dark wood. ""This is where I wrote 'Vice,' "" McKay said, indicating a desk facing a bay window. A faux-Roman bust, purchased in a prop-department sale for $5, dwarfed McKay's computer. A vintage poster for the Japanese release of ""Network"" hung beside bookshelves decorated with memorabilia from McKay's films: the clapboard from ""The Big Short,"" a production still from ""The Other Guys."" Piled together on one shelf were some of the books McKay consulted for ""Vice,"" including Barton Gellman's Cheney biography, ""Angler,"" Jane Mayer's ""war on terror"" history, ""The Dark Side,"" and Cheney's own memoir, ""In My Time."" ""There are a lot of layers to my attraction to Cheney's story, and one of them is how quiet and mysterious he was, how he's covered his trail all these years,"" McKay said. ""You read his entire autobiography, and you learn nothing about him. Cheney is one of the most brilliant bureaucratic infighters in history, but he knew how to do all this stuff so that you barely knew it was happening."" McKay has dedicated his recent work to illuminating just such self-obscuring systems of power, the kind that depend on opacity to function. In ""The Big Short,"" the narrator, played by Ryan Gosling, puts it this way: ""Mortgage-backed securities. Subprime loans. Tranches. It's pretty confusing, right? Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid? Well, it's supposed to. Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do. Or, even better, for you just to leave them the [expletive] alone."" Last year, McKay directed the pilot for and served as an executive producer on ""Succession,"" an HBO drama about a Murdoch-style media-empire patriarch and his reprobate heirs — their nefarious business dealings and abject power moves. In ""Vice,"" he uses Cheney's life to tell a broader tale about what McKay describes as ""the Republican revolution and how it changed our country."" He sees Cheney as a ""Zelig-style"" figure of the right. His career in national politics began in the Nixon administration as a congressional intern and then apprentice to Donald Rumsfeld and, from there, intersected and coincided with the rise of key conservative figures: among them the Fox News founder, Roger Ailes, who first floated the idea for a conservative news network while working for Nixon; right-wing megadonors like the Koch brothers; conservative strategy shops like the Heritage Foundation; and, finally, George W. Bush, over whose administration — and over whose decision to invade Iraq after Sept. 11, despite paltry intelligence linking the two — Cheney exercised unprecedented influence for a vice president. One of McKay's models was ""The Power Broker,"" Robert Caro's landmark biography of Robert Moses. ""He's in the middle of all this stuff,"" McKay said of Cheney, ""and finally he gets his hand on the wheel."" Unlike Caro, McKay had to tell his story through a camera, and so there are compressions, elisions and metaphors in ""Vice"" that reflect both a filmmaker's desire to enthrall the crowd and a prosecutor's desire to nail the defendant. Reading journalistic accounts of Cheney's move, in 2000, from the private sector back into public service, we learn that he took elaborate steps to divest from Halliburton, the oil conglomerate where he was C.E.O., to avoid the appearance of conflict; here, the relationship between Cheney and the energy sector is presented as one of clear cronyism. Or take Sept. 11. In Barton Gellman's play-by-play of that morning in ""Angler,"" it's strongly implied that Cheney usurped Bush's authority, ignoring the chain of command and giving fighter jets the O.K. to shoot down commercial airliners if they appeared to be hijacked. The official White House version was that Bush gave Cheney permission to pass along this order, and Gellman, poring carefully through communications records and notes taken by administration staff members, leaves open the extremely slim possibility that this is true. In ""Vice"" there is no such equivocation. We see Cheney give the order to take out the planes himself. Compression, of course, isn't the same as distortion: Jane Mayer, the investigative journalist, described this scene to me as ""a perfect gem,"" and told McKay, after he screened the movie for her, that he ""got it right."" One way McKay might have buttressed ""Vice"" against possible charges of liberal bias would be to include the sorts of political critiques he readily offers up in conversation. ""When Clinton was elected, he cut welfare and deregulated banks, just like a Republican would have done,"" he said, from his couch. ""Obama waged a war against whistle-blowers, he let the banks off the hook and he expanded executive power."" McKay did tinker for a while with stitching points like these into ""Vice"" — making it ""the story of Dick Cheney and the rise of the Republican Party, and how they got so big they swallowed the Democrats."" To this end, he pieced in footage of Hillary Clinton supporting the Iraq war. ""But it's hard,"" McKay went on. ""The audience only has a certain amount of oxygen in their lungs."" As he said earlier: ""I could have made the movie three and a half hours long, but you can thank me that I didn't."" (The film runs just over 130 minutes.) McKay predicted that some of the fiercest criticisms of ""Vice"" might come from putatively sympathetic voices: ""I actually think left-wing friends of mine are going to be mad at me for humanizing him as much as I do."" Throughout the film, Cheney is depicted as a fearsomely capable stalker of prey; a recurring motif concerns his passion for fly fishing, which McKay described to me as crucial to understanding him. He hired a fly fisherman as a consultant. ""You can't believe the level of patience and detail that's involved — lifting up the rocks to see what kinds of bugs are underneath so you know what kind of lure to use; watching the drift, the way the sun's hitting it so you know what illusion to create with your lure. And that's the story with Dick Cheney. Meticulous detail and tremendous patience."" Cheney is rendered tenderly in his interactions with Lynne, his sweetheart since high school, and with his second daughter, Mary, whose coming out as gay in the mid-'80s he met with private encouragement and affection. Christian Bale told me that he seized on Cheney's marriage as his way into the role. ""With any part, you choose what you focus on,"" he said, explaining that, in ""Vice,"" he chose ""the love story. I think Cheney's one of the most romantic men around. At the start he wasn't particularly ambitious. Very laid back. But he has this undying love, where he'll do anything to win Lynne's approval — he did it all for her."" He added that ""the hardest thing with playing him was trying to understand that awesome power. I could never quite imagine what it must be like to wake up every morning knowing the power within your hands, where your choices affect whether people will die. I obsessed over it for months. But I don't think he sees himself as a villain — unless someone's a sociopath, I think they believe their motives are for a bigger good."" On the subject of villainy, McKay said: ""Cheney and Bush did kill, conservatively, half a million civilians in Iraq. Some estimates have it at more than a million. So he's pretty bad."" But, he said, ""I think you have to humanize him, because unless we see how a regular human being can go down these roads, it's useless."" (McKay has heard nothing from the Cheneys, who did not participate in the making of the film, although he noted that Mary started following him on Twitter.) Recently, a sizable portion of the left has adopted surprising, relatively sanguine attitudes toward the Bush-Cheney years. I asked McKay, who directed a scathingly satirical 2009 Broadway show about Bush called, ""You're Welcome America,"" whether he saw his unsparing portrait of Cheney in ""Vice"" — humanizing gestures notwithstanding — as a would-be corrective to liberal amnesia on this score. ""I hope to God that it is,"" McKay said, nodding. ""Really what that shows you is the number of people for whom government is just about appearance. Bush and Cheney just kept up the facade, whereas this administration doesn't even remotely pretend. So when I hear people say, 'I miss the days of Bush and Cheney,' what they're really saying is, 'I miss the days when people would at least pretend.' "" He went on: ""Every time I see it, I shake my head, like, 'You've got to be kidding me. The world economy collapsed, we had the greatest military fiasco in U.S. history apart from Vietnam.' When I hear 'Trump makes you miss Bush,' I go, 'There's no question that Bush and Cheney are way ahead of him in terms of damage done.' "" He characterized such Bush nostalgia bluntly: ""Now that my house is on fire, I long for when it was infested by bees."" In July, McKay was sprawled in a similarly oblong configuration across a different couch, this one in a postproduction suite on the Sony Pictures lot. He was working with the editor Hank Corwin to fine-tune ""Vice"" for release. Corwin, a Hollywood veteran who cut ""The Big Short"" and whose other credits include Terrence Malick's ""Tree of Life"" and Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers,"" stood at a monitor in beat-up running sneakers. An executive producer, Robyn Wholey, sat on a stool. ""We've been playing with this one scene,"" McKay explained. ""It's one of our most challenging runs."" The scene in question takes place in Dick and Lynne Cheney's bedroom on a stormy night in 2000, after George W. Bush has won the Republican nomination and offered Cheney the No. 2 spot on the ticket. Cheney has declined, volunteering instead to lead the vice-presidential search. In the available accounts of this moment, Cheney's motivations remain obscure. Was the search a canard — a mechanism for Cheney, who always intended to take the job, to amass dirt on G.O.P. luminaries that he could later leverage against them? By stalling, was he able to extract more power from Bush when he eventually said yes? Rather than paper over this uncertainty, McKay decided to dramatize it in a particularly audacious way: Bale and Adams begin speaking in a Shakespearean approximation of Early Modern English. ""Is my life to be spent in servant's bow to Nixon, Ford, the thespian Reagan and Bush the Elder?"" Dick asks, to which Lynne replies, ""Danced nimbly 'round the kings' hearth thou hath, even whilst clamored I for more."" As thunder grows louder in the background, the couple converse in iambs for three full minutes, working themselves up into a libidinal fever as they contemplate the opportunity before them: ""Mine own blood and will are yours 'til pierced be the last soldier's breastplate spilling forth its ruby jellied treasures!"" Adams cries out as she climbs atop Bale. Corwin showed me the Shakespeare run, then said, ""Every time we play this at test screenings —"" ""It's resoundingly rejected,"" McKay said. ""It's horrifying how much people hate it,"" Corwin reiterated. Wholey chimed in on a more upbeat note: ""I missed it when you took it out."" ""Some people love it,"" McKay allowed, ""but three out of four definitely hate it."" McKay has long relied on test screenings to shape his movies. Making comedies, he liked to swap in different punch lines for different crowds, like a stand-up, seeing which ones got bigger laughs and tweaking cuts accordingly. Even after moving into drama, he has found test screenings and focus groups indispensable to ensuring that audiences remain on board, moment to moment — especially so with ""Vice,"" given its collage of moods and modes. ""If you sit in rooms like this too long, you lose perspective,"" Corwin said. Not that the goal is milquetoast consensus. In 2013, when I visited the set of ""Anchorman 2,"" McKay put it to me this way: ""Ideally, you want to be alienating four people, and you want six people to love it."" (Annapurna is likely hoping for more favorable math — in October, reports circulated that the company was suffering from money trouble, attributed to its model of spending lavishly on auteur-driven projects; McKay's movies have all done well at the box office, but several of these reports invoked ""Vice"" as a particularly pricey gamble. Annapurna dismisses such reports and says they have full confidence in ""Vice."") McKay also showed ""Vice"" to filmmaker friends like Paul Thomas Anderson and David O. Russell. After Anderson, who watched two preliminary cuts, told McKay that the end of the movie worked great but the start ""had problems,"" McKay decided to scrap two early sections: an elaborate musical number and a prolonged passage set in Cheney's Wyoming adolescence. McKay adored both but decided that Anderson was right — they were gumming up the machinery. Amy Adams, for her part, loved the Shakespeare sequence. ""It's such a great way to explain the motivations of the characters,"" she said, while acknowledging that ""it was challenging, because it could so easily feel big and broad, but it has to feel intimate."" The passage testified, in her mind, to the way McKay ""was able to so seamlessly navigate tone."" She mentioned an informal exercise that she and McKay practiced on set to help keep her grounded in her character despite the movie's many shifts in register. ""I'd come in at the beginning of the day, kind of half-Lynne, half-Amy, and Adam and I would have these debates"" — about news events depicted in the film, about whatever was in the headlines on that day of shooting. ""It was such a great tool for me to get into Lynne,"" she said. McKay wasn't sure he could get the Shakespeare scene to click, but he was intent on trying. ""We have a nice head of steam going through this part of the movie that we're loath to mess up, so we took it out for a while,"" he said. ""The scene ends well — it's always ended well. Getting into it is a little rickety. Now we're feeling that the movie's overall structure is playing so strong, though, that maybe we can try and pull off this cliff dive."" So they experimented. Three minutes did feel long. Could they trim the exchange closer to one? And what if Plemons's narrator came in up top with some coy prefatory remarks to the effect of, ""O.K., so we have no idea what was going through Cheney's head here, and it's not like we can just imagine it through a scene of fake Shakespeare — or can we?"" McKay was leaning toward something like that: ""My new thought is maybe we just go bigger with our interruption."" What if the screen went black? ""No matter what we do, there's gonna be a 'What the [expletive]' reaction,"" said Corwin. ""Oh, that's a given,"" McKay replied. ""It's more about percentages of 'What the. ... ' I could live with 46 percent. I could even get to 55-60 percent. But this scene might be 88 percent, where you start ripping a hole in the movie. Are you O.K. with 88 percent 'What the ... ,' Hank?"" ""I'll follow you to the gates of hell,"" Corwin said, and rewound the scene to give it another look. McKay has long regarded the fourth wall as a barrier not to be playfully punctured so much as rammed into at full speed. In 1992, when he was a young improv comic living in Chicago, he led a crowd out of a theater and up to a rooftop where, with the aid of a CPR dummy, he leapt to his ""death"" in front of them. In another performance, he surrounded the audience with a phalanx of paratroopers — armed, screaming and, as if that weren't unsettling enough, wearing gas masks. In 1995, Lorne Michaels caught wind of McKay and hired him onto the writing staff of ""Saturday Night Live."" After just one year, at age 28, he was promoted to head writer. McKay told me that his favorite sketches were those oddities that cast and crew referred to as ""10-to-ones,"" for the time they aired — the later the hour, the weirder the sketch could be. He found a like-minded conspirator in Will Ferrell, who was hired onto ""S.N.L."" the same day as McKay, and who shared his taste for absurd sketches poking fun at oafish, arrogant, rageful men. In the first thing they wrote together, Ferrell played a grotesque version of Neil Diamond, revealing the depraved inspirations behind benign hits like ""Forever in Blue Jeans."" (""This next song I wrote after I killed a drifter to get an erection."") One of McKay's fondest early contributions to the show starts with the title sequence for a program called ""The Hulk Hogan Talk Show!!!"" This sequence — consisting of a droningly repetitive jingle, garish title cards and numerous stills of Hogan in the ring — lasts an almost interminable 45 seconds, ramping up in fanfare as it goes. The joke is that this is all misdirection. When the talk show finally starts, we are greeted by Ferrell, wearing a suit and tie on a chintzy set and interviewing a recently released hostage. ""Hulk Hogan is on vacation,"" Ferrell says. ""I'm your guest host, Phil Tobin."" (McKay mocked Cheney several times on the show, including in cold opens and an installment of the animated ""X-Presidents"" series, which he co-wrote, during which the ghost of George Washington calls Cheney ""a douche bag"" and impales him with a quill pen.) McKay traces his sense of humor to a youthful love of Monty Python and some lasting lessons in irreverence from his mother. ""She'd always be poking holes in things,"" McKay said, whether it was sneaking him into the local Y.M.C.A. pool, because memberships were too expensive, or reading children's books and changing them ""so that Little Andy and Dottie were going to the supermarket and shoplifting."" He recalled how one April Fools' Day, when he was in second grade, he got into bed and she'd dumped sand into it. ""And she's like, 'April Fools'! It confused me for a couple days, but then it was awesome. It opened up the whole world to me, like, You can play pranks on people!"" Over the past decade or so, McKay noted, his mother has grown increasingly conservative, faithfully watching Fox News and voting for Trump in the 2016 election despite supporting Obama in 2008. McKay described her move rightward as a source of both pain and confusion for him — and a source of ongoing debate between them — but said that their relationship remained a loving one. When he went to college at Temple University in Philadelphia, McKay studied literature. His favorite authors were those who scrambled storytelling conventions, like John Dos Passos and William Faulkner. Outside class, he tried stand-up comedy. ""I started doing open mics and bombing,"" he recalled. ""I was never great, but I got decent enough."" McKay has said, ""Occasionally I'd drop a political joke in, and I was really bad at it, so I would quickly get them out of my act and go back to joking about airplanes and girlfriends I broke up with."" During his senior year, a fellow aspiring comedian named Rick Roman came back from a trip to Chicago and told him, "" 'There's this thing out there called long-form improv, where you get onstage and do whatever you want,' "" McKay recalled. ""I go, 'Like stand-up?' 'No. You go into a scene and you say, ""We're on the moon,"" and the only rule is you can't say no.' "" McKay was sold. In 1990, just 18 credits shy of graduation, he unloaded his comic-book collection for $800, bought a secondhand Chrysler and moved to Chicago. There, he enrolled in improv classes with the avant-garde acting coach Del Close, a gruff, bearded guru whose past students had included Bill Murray and Gilda Radner, and whose '90s-era charges included Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert. (Close died in 1999.) McKay joined an improv team called the Family, which became Close's test group: ""He would work out his new forms through us,"" McKay recalled. In one of these, ""we'd improvise a whole movie, and use movie language — credits, camera angles, smash cuts and all."" McKay, the erstwhile lit major, named one new form ""the Deconstruction"": ""You started with a scene played really well. Close listening, detailed characters, implying a world. And then for the rest of the form you rip that first scene apart: pick up on pieces of it, flash backward, flash forward, pick up a character element and exaggerate it."" In the early 1990s, McKay formed a troupe that would become the Upright Citizens Brigade, including Matt Besser, Horatio Sanz and Ian Roberts. Today, U.C.B. has grown into a bicoastal talent factory, offering classes in New York and Los Angeles, and its former students are everywhere in modern comedy. In its earliest incarnation, though, it was a scrappy upstart with an anarchic sensibility that stood in contrast to more established and relatively staid Chicago outfits like Second City. ""We were doing this crazy show in a coffee house, but then we got a good review, and there were lines around the block,"" McKay said. ""It was an amazing experience, but I was still broke."" He eventually decamped for Second City, where he was integral to some modernizing changes — no more stage, no more curtain, no more rigidly formulaic revues — and where he ""actually started making some money. Besser was pissed at me, but I'm like, 'Dude, I can't pay my rent!' "" (His U.C.B. teammates soon replaced him with another young comedian, Amy Poehler.) It's hard to imagine McKay making a movie like ""Vice"" without his time spent exploding narrative strategies and provoking audiences in Chicago. This is nowhere clearer than in accounts of ""Piñata Full of Bees,"" a hit Second City revue he cocreated. In one bit, McKay portrayed Noam Chomsky as a substitute teacher, terrifying grade-school children with the genocidal story of ""the real Thanksgiving."" Cast members would interrupt performances to recite statistics about how, say, military spending dwarfed welfare spending. One night, they tried to convince the audience that President Clinton had just moments before been killed, stopping the performance with a shellshocked announcement. Wheeling out a television to watch news of the assassination, however, the cast became distracted by frivolous programming. The comedian Scott Adsit, who was part of the troupe, described this stunt several years ago: ""We all started sitting with our backs to the audience, watching sports bloopers, and didn't do anything but laugh at the TV for another 10 minutes, until the room cleared."" It was a macabre and confrontational prank they pulled only once, Adsit said, noting that even some Second City members were uncomfortable with it. He gave credit — or blame — where it was due: ""It was Adam McKay's idea."" In October, McKay flew to New York to show ""Vice"" to media types including Jane Mayer; the writer Ron Suskind; Ira Glass, host of ""This American Life""; and Chris Hayes, the MSNBC personality. Annapurna also ""hired a couple of fact checkers and let them beat us up,"" McKay said, ""and we caught a couple little mistakes and fixed them."" At a restaurant after one of these screenings, McKay picked a friendly fight with Glass and Hayes, asking why they didn't lead every episode of their shows with climate-change stories. They replied that, if they did, pretty soon no one would tune in. ""O.K., so on the face of it, nothing is more boring than climate science,"" McKay told me. ""But Hayes is brilliant, and we know Glass is, so I give them a hard time. I tell Hayes, 'Dude, use big red letters that say BREAKING EMERGENCY: MILLIONS TO DIE — use the b.s. of television to do it!' "" McKay, like Hayes and Glass, has become invested in figuring out how to get audiences to enjoy the taste of vegetables. He is producing a documentary series at Amazon called ""This Giant Beast That Is the Global Economy,"" which will explore such topics as the corruption-riddled world of concrete. He has signed on to direct a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence as Elizabeth Holmes, the Silicon Valley executive, indicted on charges of fraud, behind the disgraced health-services company Theranos. And, he told me, he has three ideas for movies about climate change, which he considers the ultimate vegetable: ""I have one that's epic, one that's comedic and one that's a poetic art film,"" he said. The comedy — the only one of these he would describe — concerns a group of Republican congresspeople from Oklahoma, forced to live in an air-conditioned dome after their state has been otherwise depopulated by global warming, unwilling to give up their seats despite their nonexistent constituency. If McKay ever makes this movie, it will be bleak, no matter how funny it turns out. He acknowledged that ""The Big Short"" is a bleak movie, too, and that ""Vice"" is bleaker still: ""It does not send you back into the world feeling good."" It was getting late in the afternoon. I could hear an animal whimpering in McKay's kitchen. It was the family's new puppy, a black-and-brown rescue named Timothy, who was being house-trained within a mesh-walled pen. McKay told me that not long after his heart attack, the last family pet, a beloved dog named Pumpkin, died. ""That was tough,"" he said, and there was more where that came from. Last fall, Shira Piven was riding in a Lyft when another driver smashed into the car. An ambulance rushed her to the hospital, where they took CT scans and M.R.I.s. Scrutinizing these, doctors discovered two troubling things: Piven's neck was broken and, what's more, there was a small growth in her chest, eventually diagnosed as malignant. ""Lung cancer,"" McKay said. ""They removed a quarter of her lung, and for a month you could barely hear her talk."" Like McKay, Piven recovered, he said, but they were shaken. ""And then on top of all this, you're seeing democracy worldwide collapse, and we're getting scientific reports from the U.N. basically saying mankind will be extinct in 25 years. I have just never experienced a two-year period like the last two years."" McKay's comedies always carried dark undertones. Ferrell's protagonists might have registered as endearing buffoons, but their tendencies toward ignorance, selfishness, sexism, racism and/or jingoism were among the ways that McKay signaled mordant satirical intentions. It might be most accurate to say that, rather than abandoning comedy in his films, he has inverted the ratio between light and dark. But despite McKay's suspicion of ""old forms"" — despite his conviction that, circa 2018, the best use for a big megaphone is to deliver urgent and edifying messages as loudly as possible — spending all your time exploring the dark side can be wearying, especially if you spent much of your career chasing sillier and sillier ways to make strangers laugh. Making comedies, McKay was essentially a shadow cast member, yelling out impromptu jokes, midscene, for his actors to repeat, cracking them up as the cameras rolled. Far from disavowing his early movies, he recalled them proudly, describing the family-prayer scene in ""Talladega Nights"" — an improv-heavy sequence full of preposterous tangents about infant Jesus and Lynyrd Skynyrd — as ""the best scene we've ever done."" Of his directorial approach, he told me that ""doing a scene with Ferrell, it's almost like I'm out there with him,"" whereas, working with Bale and Adams on ""Vice,"" ""it's very gentle, very subtle. If Ferrell's a Ferrari, meaning fast and fun, I feel like Bale and Adams are narwhals"" — a wondrous species of whale with a unicorn-like tusk, hard to find outside the Far North. ""You're watching them, like: 'I can't believe I'm seeing this. I'm gonna shut up. That's an actual narwhal. You can see the horn!' "" He laughed. ""Once I have this magical moment, then I'll dare to wreck it."" I reminded McKay of a moment of a much daffier sort that I observed years ago, during the making of ""Anchorman 2."" McKay and Ferrell improvised an improbable erotic fantasy about Mrs. Butterworth, nowhere in the film's script, with each topping the other's jokes, relay-race style, and sent the entire set into bouts of convulsive laughter. McKay beamed at this memory. ""Oh, I miss those days,"" he said, sounding suddenly homesick. Timothy was crying softly in the kitchen; the sun was setting; the sea ice was melting; the actual narwhals were imperiled. McKay shook his head. ""You're making me want to go do a comedy right now."""
News,2018-11-29,"Just a few years ago, Microsoft was seen as a lumbering has-been of the technology world.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/technology/microsoft-apple-worth-how.html,994," Just a few years ago, Microsoft was seen as a lumbering has-been of the technology world. It was big and still quite profitable, but the company had lost its luster, failing or trailing in the markets of the future like mobile, search, online advertising and cloud computing. Its stock price languished, inching up 3 percent in the decade through the end of 2012. It's a very different story today. Microsoft is running neck and neck with Apple for the title of the world's most valuable company, both worth about $850 billion, thanks to a stock price that has climbed 30 percent over the last 12 months. At the end of trading Friday, Microsoft was just ahead of its longtime rival. So what happened? There is a short-term explanation for Microsoft's market rise, and there is a longer-term one. The near-term, stock-trading answer is that Microsoft has held up better than others during the recent sell-off of tech company shares. Apple investors are worried about a slowdown in iPhone sales. Facebook and Google face persistent attacks on their role in distributing false news and conspiracy theories, and investor concerns that their privacy policies could scare off users and advertisers. But the more enduring and important answer is that Microsoft has become a case study of how a once-dominant company can build on its strengths and avoid being a prisoner of its past. It has fully embraced cloud computing, abandoned an errant foray into smartphones and returned to its roots as mainly a supplier of technology to business customers. That strategy was outlined by Satya Nadella shortly after he became chief executive in 2014. Since then, Microsoft's stock price has nearly tripled. Microsoft's path to cloud computing — processing, storage and software delivered as a service over the internet from remote data centers — was lengthy and sometimes halting. Its forerunners to cloud computing go back to the 1990s, with Microsoft's MSN online service and later its Bing search engine. In 2010, four years after Amazon entered the cloud market, Microsoft introduced its cloud service. But it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon's until 2013, analysts say. Even then, Microsoft's cloud service was a side business. The corporate center of gravity remained its Windows operating system, the linchpin of the company's wealth and power during the personal computer era. That changed after Mr. Nadella replaced Steven A. Ballmer, who had been chief executive for 14 years. Mr. Nadella made the cloud service a top priority, and the company is now a strong No. 2 to Amazon. Microsoft has nearly doubled its share of that market to 13 percent since the end of 2015, according to the Synergy Research Group. Amazon's share has held steady at 33 percent over that span. Microsoft has also retooled its popular Office apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint in a cloud version, Office 365. That offering caters to people who prefer to use software as an internet service and gives Microsoft a competitive entry against online app suppliers like Google. The financial payoff from the shift came gradually at first, but is accelerating. In the year that ended in June, Microsoft's revenue rose 15 percent, to $110 billion, and operating profit increased 13 percent, to $35 billion. ""The essence of what Satya Nadella did was the dramatic shift to the cloud,"" said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ""He put Microsoft back into a high-growth business."" It is the perception that Microsoft is on a high-growth track that has fueled its rising share price. When Microsoft acquired Nokia's mobile phone business in 2013, Mr. Ballmer hailed the move as a ""bold step into the future."" Two years later, Mr. Nadella walked away from that future, taking a $7.6 billion charge, nearly the entire value of the purchase, and shedding 7,800 workers. Microsoft would not try to compete with the smartphone technology leaders, Apple, Google and Samsung. Instead, Microsoft focused on its developing apps and other software for business customers. Microsoft does have a successful consumer franchise in its Xbox video game business. But it is a separate unit, and though it generates revenue of $10 billion, that is still less than 10 percent of the company's overall sales. Microsoft products, in the main, are about utility — productivity tools, whether people use them at work or at home. And its Azure cloud technology is a service for businesses and a platform for software developers to build applications, a kind of cloud operating system. Mr. Nadella's big acquisitions have been intended to add to its offerings for business users and developers. In 2016, Microsoft bought LinkedIn, the social network for professionals, for $26.2 billion. ""It's really the coming together of the professional cloud and the professional network,"" Mr. Nadella explained at the time. This year, Microsoft paid $7.5 billion for GitHub, an open software platform used by 28 million programmers. Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has loosened up. Windows would no longer be its center of gravity — or its anchor. Microsoft apps would run not only on Apple's Macintosh software but on other operating systems as well. Open source and free software, once anathema to Microsoft, was embraced as a vital tool of modern software development. Mr. Nadella preached an outward-looking mind-set. ""We need to be insatiable in our desire to learn from the outside and bring that learning into Microsoft,"" he wrote in his book ""Hit Refresh,"" published last year. The company's financial performance — and its stock price — suggest that the Nadella formula is working. ""The old, Windows-centric view of the world stifled innovation,"" said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. ""The company has changed culturally. Microsoft is an exciting place to work again."""

In It’s No Secret, couples share thoughts about commitment and tell us what they have learned along the way, revealing their secret to making it work.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/fashion/weddings/a-connection-was-made-within-seconds-of-their-first-call.html,1085," Because marriage is an ever-evolving experience, we constantly shift, change and, in some cases, start over. In It's No Secret, couples share thoughts about commitment and tell us what they have learned along the way, revealing their secret to making it work. Who Laurie Lewis, 59, and Nancy Sager, 60. Occupations Ms. Lewis is a former jingle writer turned real estate broker for the Corcoran Group; Ms. Sager is the director of listings at Citi Habitats. Their Marriage 3 years, 6 months and counting. The couple married May 16, 2015 before more than 120 guests at the Down Town Association in Manhattan's Financial District. They were supposed to marry at Ramscale Studio, a loft space in the West Village, but the air-conditioner broke four days before the wedding. Ms. Sager's boss, Gary L. Malin, the president of Citi Habitats who became a Universal Life minister, officiated. Ms. Lewis's mother, who was too ill to attend, watched via FaceTime. The couple walked down the aisle to two versions of ""One Fine Day"" (by the Chiffons and Natalie Merchant). They live in Chelsea with their rescue hound, Mia. In 1998, Ms. Lewis got a call from a friend saying she was going to a bar with some gal pals; there was someone she wanted her to meet, a possible love interest. ""I was recently single,"" she said. ""I was dating a lot. When she told me Nancy was 40 I said, 'She's too old.'"" At the time Ms. Lewis was 39. ""I had a proclivity for younger people,"" she added. Ms. Lewis stood her ground, but agreed to phone Ms. Sager the following day. ""Within five seconds we were joking and connected in sarcasm,"" Ms. Lewis said. ""It was as if we had known each other for years."" The call turned into meeting for a drink. The drink led to dinner two days later, which morphed into an overnight. Hours and hours of phone calls followed. ""We could talk until 1 or 3 in the morning,"" Ms. Lewis said. ""We would fall asleep on the phone. It never got old. I wanted to be with her from Day 1."" And so they were. Years went by, then a decade. Yet no proposal followed. ""I wasn't going to be the one to ask. I'd asked so many times,"" Ms. Lewis said. ""Nancy never wanted to marry."" Then on Valentine's Day 2015, Ms. Sager surprised Ms. Lewis by presenting her with a silver box. Inside were 17 hand-painted cards depicting something symbolic for each year they had been together. ""The last card was of a couple getting married with our faces superimposed over theirs. It was the most amazing proposal,"" she said. They were married three months later. Ms. Lewis My mother died shortly after our wedding. Marriage provided me with a sense of safety and family that helped with the profound loss. It made our connection even deeper and more beautiful. The second I met Nancy, I knew her. It was love at first sight for me. Nancy is very funny, sharp and smart. She's beautiful inside and out. She's very succinct and precise; I'm very broad stroke and emotional. I'm better one on one; she's better in a crowd. I'm a sentimental pack rat; Nancy pares everything down to what she wants and needs. It's because of those differences that we have a successful relationship. We are each other's antidepressants. We encourage each other's positives and successes, and make up for each other's deficits. We don't really argue. We recognize that we have differences. We don't agree on everything but we have learned to talk it out and agree to disagree. Usually one of us is feeling vulnerable that has nothing to do with the other person, and it splashes onto the relationship. Over the years, Nancy has become willing to step outside her comfort zone. She's more open. She can make things succinct and she simplifies the world in a way for me that I probably complicate for her. She's got an incredible heart, which she doesn't give away easily. It takes a long time to earn her trust and get to know her. Every day is a little bit of a challenge and that keeps me engaged. I've learned that I'm capable of a deep and lasting commitment, and sustaining interest in someone other than myself. Her challenges, joys and sadness are something I'm interested in, and invested in. Our relationship takes up space. It makes my small world feel expanded and large because I have this person to share it with, which is never boring. Ms. Sager I wasn't anti-marriage. To me, I was already in a committed relationship. But Laurie really wanted to get married, and I've learned if something matters to her, it matters to me. I've learned to be less selfish and stubborn. I tend to get into a bubble. Laurie reminds me I'm in a relationship and to be present. That I'm going through this journey with someone else. I love her for that. Laurie is a kind, gentle, compassionate person. She's loyal and dependable. She's smart and has a quick mind. And she's creative. She's poetic; I'm pragmatic. And that gets us to a middle ground that's positive and works. If either of us is having a bad day we help each other laugh through it. That's become stronger over the years. She's made me grow in all my relationships. She's made me a better version of me. We've done that for each other. As different as we are, we have a lot of similarities: we both come from upper /middle class, Jewish backgrounds. She's from the suburbs of New York; I'm from the suburbs of Philadelphia. Our parents are from the same generation. We're both short, dark, and are the same age. We've experienced life at the same pace. We get the same cultural references. It's the same description; there's comfort in that. We were together for 17 years before we got married. We already had the power of two. But when you stand up and agree to spend the rest of our lives together, you become a force. Every morning we have a routine. It always starts with Laurie asking, 'Do you know what today is?' It's my job to answer it: 1,280 days or whatever number it is for the day. That's how many days we've been married. I never get bored of saying it. It's become part of us."

At the time, I thought this would be a game changer for women, and of course, it was — to a point. But the real mystery, after half a century, is why life at the top of large American corporations still seems so overwhelmingly male. Before classified ads went unisex, women had no established path to high-level jobs. I went job hunting in New York with some classmates from the all-female Hollins College in 1958, a decade before The Times made the change. Never in our dreams did we envision getting jobs as promising as those of the boys we knew, even though — I will just say it — we were smarter than most of them and harder working. It did not even seem odd to us that practically all of the good entry-level jobs were exclusively for men. Those with college degrees were mostly going into training programs at financial institutions or marketing companies, or in industry, where they would learn the ropes and have their talents assessed and encouraged as they moved along. We women were sorting through the ""Help Wanted — Female"" section, poring over ads from places seeking a ""Gal Friday."" The need for such low-paid workers — women who could write a coherent phone message and deliver coffee without spilling — seemed insatiable. Secretarial positions were among the better-paid work, and it was not unusual, especially in publishing, for a bright woman who started as a secretary to break out and rise up; some great editors took that route. Such exceptions do not change the fact that in 1958, almost all of the jobs open to women were dead ends. Things began to open up in the 1960s with legal challenges brought after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The main purpose of the legislation, as originally conceived, was to prohibit job discrimination on the basis of race, but a Virginia congressman, vigorously opposed to the bill, added an amendment outlawing discrimination on the basis of sex. Many historians argue that he was actually seeking to kill the bill, reasoning that the specter of women getting ""men's jobs"" would do the trick. Somewhat miraculously, the ploy backfired and the amendment passed. In time, the act became the death knell for ""Help Wanted — Female."" Even so, change came very slowly. In the late 1970s, when I was a writer at Fortune magazine, I persuaded the editors to give me time to search through the Securities and Exchange Commission filings of more than 1,000 of the largest United States corporations to find high-ranking women. By my definition, that would be any woman who was paid enough to have her name and salary listed in the proxy filing, usually meaning she was one of the three highest-paid people in the company. I sifted through more than 6,000 names and found a mere 10 women, including Katharine Graham (The Washington Post), Olive Beech (Beechcraft) and Ruth Handler (Mattel — her children were actually named Barbie and Ken). As remarkable as these three women were, none of them had worked their way up; they either founded their companies with their husbands or, in Ms. Graham's case, got the job through a family connection. At the time, I took the upbeat and not uncommon position that once more women were ""in the pipeline"" — starting in the same jobs that had traditionally streamed men to the top — executive suites would be teeming with women. Not everyone was that sanguine. In my reporting, I remember asking Herman Kahn, the ""futurist"" who founded the Hudson Institute, how long it would take for women to account for 25 percent of the C.E.O.s on the Fortune 500. His reply: ""About 2,000 years, but make it 10 percent and I'll say within 20 years."" In Mr. Kahn's view, not that many women would want the top jobs, an opinion almost as unfashionable then as it is today. I confess to thinking now that Mr. Kahn might have been right. For a futurist, though, his forecast is an embarrassment: At last count, some 40 years later, there are only 25 female C.E.O.s, just 5 percent, on the Fortune 500. There must be a reason for this weak showing, but access to the pipeline, we can now safely say, isn't it. Wyndham Robertson, a former assistant managing editor at Fortune, got her first job through a Times ""Help Wanted — Female"" ad."
News,2018-11-29,"Deutsche Bank’s efforts to escape a history of scandal, wrongdoing and mismanagement suffered a serious setback Thursday after the German police raided its headquarters in Frankfurt as part of an investigation into whether the lender helped criminals launder money through offshore tax havens.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/business/deutsche-bank-money-laundering-raid.html,1085," Deutsche Bank's efforts to escape a history of scandal, wrongdoing and mismanagement suffered a serious setback Thursday after the German police raided its headquarters in Frankfurt as part of an investigation into whether the lender helped criminals launder money through offshore tax havens. Arriving in a fleet of blue-and-white police vans, 170 prosecutors, federal agents, police officers and tax authorities searched the headquarters and five other sites in the area, prosecutors in Frankfurt said. The officers seized paper documents and electronic records related to the case, which involved hundreds of millions of euros, and were still at the bank late Thursday. The investigation stems from information contained in the so-called Panama Papers and Offshore Leaks, a trove of confidential documents that helped to expose the workings of global money laundering and tax evasion, prosecutors said. Deutsche Bank employees, who were not identified, are suspected of guiding customers to establish companies in offshore tax havens and transfer money earned through criminal activity using Deutsche Bank accounts, the prosecutors said. A subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands is under intense scrutiny. Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender, said in a statement it was ""cooperating fully"" with investigators and expressed surprise at the raid. ""We have already provided the authorities with all the relevant information regarding Panama Papers,"" Jörg Eigendorf, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, said on Twitter. The size of the raid and sums of money involved suggest that a yearslong effort to remake the bank's culture and improve compliance has fallen short. During the last decade, Deutsche Bank has paid billions of euros of fines for an array of misconduct, including deceiving buyers of mortgage-backed securities, colluding with other banks to rig benchmark interest rates and manipulating foreign exchange trading to the detriment of customers. ""This says they are not genuine and sincere about changing this culture of noncompliance and changing this culture of impunity,"" said Jimmy Gurulé, a former United States assistant attorney general who is a professor of criminal law at Notre Dame Law School and has written several books on terrorism financing. Such regulatory and enforcement action, combined with management mistakes, have taken a toll on profits. Deutsche Bank reported net earnings of 750 million euros, or $854 million, during the third quarter on revenue of €19.7 billion. That is considered a paltry return for a bank, and was less than half the earnings a year earlier. In April, Christian Sewing, who had just become the bank's third chief executive in three years, said Deutsche would scale back its investment banking unit, the source of most of the trouble. The decision effectively ended a costly 20-year quest to compete with the likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. Deutsche Bank has previously faced scrutiny related to money laundering. Last year, the bank paid a $425 million fine in New York for helping clients of its Moscow office illegally move $10 billion out of Russia. Also last year, the Federal Reserve fined Deutsche Bank $41 million for failing to have an effective system for complying with bank secrecy laws and laws to prevent money laundering. In September, the German bank regulator said it had appointed a monitor to ensure that Deutsche Bank had adequate measures in place to prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism. Deutsche Bank has also been drawn into scandal at Denmark's Danske Bank, which faces criminal investigations over suspected money laundering in its Estonian branch. Deutsche, among other banks, handled certain transactions for Danske. Deutsche Bank says it stopped doing work for the Danske Bank Estonian branch in 2015. Police raids are nothing new at the bank, either. The authorities conducted large-scale searches in 2015 and 2012 in cases involving alleged tax fraud. The latest investigation focuses on two employees, who were not publicly identified but whose ages were given as 50 and 46, as well as other people whom investigators have not yet identified. In 2016 alone, prosecutors said, a Deutsche Bank subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands served 900 customers with transactions worth 311 million, or more than $350 million. Deutsche Bank employees are accused of neglecting their duty to report suspicious transactions ""although ample grounds existed,"" prosecutors said in a statement. ""Deutsche Bank helped customers found offshore organizations in tax havens by transferring illegally acquired money without alerting authorities to suspected money laundering,"" prosecutors said. Nadja Niesen, a spokeswoman for the Frankfurt prosecutors, declined to comment beyond information given in the written statement. The raids were the latest example of how the Panama Papers have, over the past two years, shed light on the methods that people and companies use to hide their wealth and avoid taxes. The papers — millions of confidential documents from the Mossack Fonseca law firm in Panama — identify international politicians, business leaders and celebrities involved in webs of suspicious financial transactions. They included hundreds of Deutsche Bank customers. The documents were obtained by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared with news organizations around the world through the nonprofit International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The result was a series of exposés in 2016 on how rich and well-connected individuals and companies were able to skirt tax laws. The revelations spurred enforcement action and unveiled routine corruption in the global financial system. They also exposed how offshore banking — meant to help ease cross-border business — had become a tool, in some cases, for excessive tax avoidance. The documents themselves were not proof of wrongdoing, but news reports tracked close associates of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, relatives of President Xi Jinping of China, members of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee and even the father of Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain as maintaining accounts for tax advantages. Thursday's raid marked a new low for Deutsche Bank, which has never quite recovered from the turmoil of the 2008 financial crisis. This year, the bank's arm in the United States failed a Federal Reserve stress test, which found that it had ""material weaknesses"" in its operations. Deutsche Bank has also faced special scrutiny by European regulators because of concerns about its holdings of risky derivatives and other assets. The bank is in the middle of a restructuring plan that is expected cut more than 7,000 jobs by the end of 2019. Although an earnings preview suggested there would be some good news after years of restructuring, the report of the raid sent shares down more than 3 percent Thursday. The shares have lost half of their value since the start of the year."
News,2018-11-29,Good Thursday. Want this by email? Sign up here.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/business/dealbook/fed-rates-markets.html,1781," Good Thursday. Want this by email? Sign up here. The Fed chairman brought smiles to trading floors yesterday with a speech at the Economic Club of New York: He needed only two words. Mr. Powell said that the Fed's benchmark interest rate was ""just below"" the neutral level. Investors took that to mean that the central bank would stop raising rates soon. That sparked a market rally. Stocks soared 2.3 percent, erasing the losses from a rocky November. (Investors may have also noticed that the bond market has signaled that the case for interest rate rises is weakening.) But don't get carried away. Analysts quickly concluded that investors were overreacting, Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT notes. ""There was little evidence in the rest of Mr. Powell's speech that he intended to signal a change in plans,"" he wrote. German officials searched the lender's offices in Frankfurt this morning. They were looking for evidence to confirm whether it helped clients set up offshore tax havens and didn't notify authorities about signs of money laundering. Prosecutors said the case was based partly on the Panama Papers leak, and is focused on at least two Deutsche Bank employees. ""Suspicion arose that Deutsche Bank helped clients with the establishment of so-called offshore entities in tax havens,"" they said in a statement. Shares in Deutsche Bank fell over 2 percent on the news, meaning its stock has fallen almost 50 percent this year so far. Deutsche Bank said it was cooperating with the investigation. President Trump isn't getting any less angry about the automaker's plan to idle plants and cut jobs. But he has found a way to tie it to another of his priorities: The plants wouldn't be closing if America had car import tariffs, he tweeted yesterday. ""The countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the U.S. for decades,"" he added. ""The President has great power on this issue — Because of the G.M. event, it is being studied now!"" Bob Lighthizer joined in. Mr. Trump's top trade negotiator said yesterday that he would ""examine all available tools"" to balance out Chinese tariffs on American cars. The news will rattle Germany and Japan. Both would be hit hard by car tariffs. Mr. Trump is expected to meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at the Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires later this week. As for that China trade truce? It's still anyone's guess, with Mr. Trump's economic team said to be divided over how tough to be. Beijing's position reportedly hasn't changed much. Officials from Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi will meet in Amsterdam today, for the first time since their former shared chairman, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested over accusations of financial misconduct. We're watching to see whether Nissan executives try to seize more power in the partnership, while Renault defends its dominance. More is still coming out about the allegations against Mr. Ghosn. The WSJ reports that he racked up over $80 million in deferred pay from Nissan, which he didn't report to financial authorities. Thanks to reports by both the British Treasury and the Bank of England, we now have a clearer indication of what Britain's departure from the E.U. would mean economically. However you slice it, it looks worse than staying in: The scariest possibility is a no-deal Brexit. The Treasury estimates that could leave the British economy 10.7 percent smaller over 15 years than it would otherwise be. The Bank of England is more pessimistic: Its worst-case ""disorderly"" scenario starts with Britain's worst recession since World War II, and has gross domestic product 10.5 percent below its previous trend after five years. The current Brexit proposal is less bad. The Treasury predicts that it would be 3.9 percent worse than staying in the E.U. over 15 years; the central bank puts the loss at 3.75 percent over five years. A glimmer of good news? The Bank of England says British banks would weather the storm. The WSJ went behind the scenes of the rapidly deteriorating trade relationship between the U.S. and China, citing interviews with decision makers. It says these were the big missteps: China didn't understand President Trump. Its leaders saw him ""as a businessman first, rather than the politician whose fixation on trade had helped carry him into office."" The White House misplayed its hand. It rattled Chinese negotiators, but didn't force them to change course. Internal squabbles made for a muddled negotiating strategy. Mr. Trump changed tack frequently. Even as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin publicly declared a truce with China in May, his boss ""went the other way, say U.S. officials, telling his advisers: 'Bring me tariffs.' "" Chinese leaders dug in. ""In the West, you have the notion that if somebody hits you on the left cheek, you turn the other cheek,"" President Xi Jinping told Western business leaders at a meeting this summer, according to the WSJ's unnamed sources. ""In our culture we punch back."" So far, U.S. businesses have managed to shrug off the malaise that has infected other economies around the world. But not entirely, according to figures the Commerce Department released yesterday: Overseas profit growth is slowing. ""U.S. profits earned overseas rose 7 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, a slowdown from profit growth of 13.7 percent in the second quarter and 15.6 percent in the first,"" the WSJ notes. What's to blame? ""Growth in China slowed, and output in Germany and Japan contracted,"" the WSJ added. ""A stronger dollar may also have been a factor, because it translates into less income earned in other currencies."" Domestic growth is still strong — for now. Profits at home rose 10.8 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and tax cuts. But trade wars, rising interest rates and growing labor costs could put an end to that. As the holidays approach, many people will donate to charitable organizations. But these groups don't handle money well, according to Jason Zweig of the WSJ: A new research paper looks at the investment returns of a huge sample of nonprofits and finds they've been abysmal: From 2009 through 2016, these endowment funds returned an average of 6.7 percent annually, compared with 12.2 percent for U.S. stocks, 10.5 percent for a 60/40 mix of stocks and bonds, and 8 percent for U.S. Treasurys. The brutal assessment of David Yermack, an N.Y.U. professor: ""You could have done better just by investing in Treasurys."" The NYT took an in-depth look at how the longtime CBS chief tried to prevent a decades-old allegation of sexual assault from surfacing in the wake of #MeToo. The tale stars Mr. Moonves; Marv Dauer, a down-on-his-luck talent manager; and Bobbie Phillips, a former client of Mr. Dauer who said that Mr. Moonves forced himself on her in 1995. Mr. Moonves offered to find Ms. Phillips work on a CBS show to keep her quiet, according to a trove of text messages that the NYT reviewed. ""If Bobbie talks, I'm finished,"" Mr. Moonves told Mr. Dauer at one point. Though Mr. Moonves was ultimately ousted, Mr. Dauer and Ms. Phillips could still cost him his enormous pay package, if CBS decides it fired him for cause. As Mr. Dauer told the NYT, ""All I know is that I'm a key witness with $120 million at stake."" More sexual misconduct news: How Jeffrey Epstein, a multimillionaire financier accused of abusing dozens of underage girls, got a sweetheart plea deal, thanks to a federal prosecutor who would become President Trump's labor secretary. Paul Polman will retire as Unilever's C.E.O. next year. He'll be succeeded by Alan Jope, the head of the beauty division, who will help the company's biggest brands regroup.

Review,2018-11-29,What drives a man to abandon a doting wife (Rachel Weisz) and three of the best-behaved children in Christendom to circumnavigate the globe in an ill-prepared trimaran? The makers of “The Mercy” have a few ideas; but perhaps the most reliable message of this based-on-real-life tale is that middle age is a bitch.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/movies/the-mercy-review.html,430," What drives a man to abandon a doting wife (Rachel Weisz) and three of the best-behaved children in Christendom to circumnavigate the globe in an ill-prepared trimaran? The makers of ""The Mercy"" have a few ideas; but perhaps the most reliable message of this based-on-real-life tale is that middle age is a bitch. Whatever the reason, such was the appeal of this adventure that Donald Crowhurst (Colin Firth), a mild-mannered engineer and indifferent sailor, was willing to risk everything to take to sea. The event was the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, which ran from 1968-69 in the publicity-roiled wake of Sir Francis Chichester's successful round-the-world yacht trip. The goal was to one-up Chichester, who had made only a single stop, and finish the race without touching land. From the very first frame, the movie's concern with deception is signaled as a bikini-clad exhibition model feigns water-skiing against a painted backdrop. Having leveraged everything he owns to acquire a shrewd financial backer (Ken Stott) and a wily press agent (David Thewlis), Crowhurst soon recognizes his recklessness while pretending to his family that all is well. Delayed for months as his specially modified boat is completed, he finally embarks, only to encounter critical equipment failure and the outer limits of his competence. Unable to continue and unwilling to face the embarrassment and bankruptcy that await him if he turns back, he devises a contemptible third option that will finally prove even more ruinous. Directed, very respectfully, by James Marsh, ""The Mercy"" (the title comes from Crowhurst's final logbook entry) is a terribly English drama, starchy and repressed. Downplaying the selfishness and irresponsibility of Crowhurst's actions, Marsh has made a movie about a man playing the part of a hero — apparently, in this telling, to restore his self-respect and gain the admiration of his children. Things loosen up a little at sea, but this is no ""All is Lost"": the effects are far from special and neither is Crowhurst's boiled-milk personality. A 2001 New York Times review of Peter Nichols' book about the race, ""A Voyage for Madmen,"" calls him ""the saddest character ever to put to sea."" If that's true, then Firth nails him, albeit in a performance so restrained that it only emphasizes the movie's lack of oceanic excitement. Yet in prioritizing Crowhurst's psychological frailty over his physical challenges (both conveyed more evocatively in the excellent 2007 documentary ""Deep Water""), Firth and his director find something quietly touching, even soulful, in the character's wretchedness. In this somber tragedy, the real demons are never anywhere but right inside that boat."
News,2018-11-29,"WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump was more involved in discussions over a potential Russian business deal during the presidential campaign than previously known, his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen said Thursday in pleading guilty to lying to Congress. Mr. Trump’s associates pursued the project as the Kremlin was escalating its election sabotage effort meant to help him win the presidency.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-russia-mueller.html,1506," WASHINGTON — Donald J. Trump was more involved in discussions over a potential Russian business deal during the presidential campaign than previously known, his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen said Thursday in pleading guilty to lying to Congress. Mr. Trump's associates pursued the project as the Kremlin was escalating its election sabotage effort meant to help him win the presidency. Mr. Trump's participation in discussions about building a grand skyscraper in Moscow showed how the interests of his business empire were enmeshed with his political ambitions as he was closing in on the Republican nomination for president. During the early months of 2016, when the business discussions were taking place, he was publicly pressing for warmer relations between the United States and Russia and an end to economic sanctions imposed by the Obama administration, policy positions that might have benefited his family business. Court documents made public by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, detailed new accusations against Mr. Cohen, the president's former fixer, who already pleaded guilty this year to committing campaign finance violations and financial crimes. Mr. Cohen was the point person at the Trump Organization for negotiating a deal for the Moscow project, and on Thursday he admitted lying to congressional investigators about the duration of the negotiations and the extent of the involvement of Mr. Trump — who is identified in the court documents as ""Individual 1."" After pleading guilty in a Manhattan courtroom on Thursday morning, Mr. Cohen said that he made the false statements to Congress out of loyalty to the president and to align with Mr. Trump's ""political messaging."" Mr. Cohen's cooperation with the special counsel's investigation raises the possibility that he might have information about the central focus of the inquiry: whether President Trump or any of his associates conspired with Russia's efforts to disrupt the 2016 election. And it was the second time that Mr. Cohen has imperiled the presidency; he said in court in New York in August that Mr. Trump directed hush money payments during the 2016 campaign to conceal potential sex scandals. The Trump Tower discussions were occurring as Russia ramped up its sabotage campaign, the information provided on Thursday by Mr. Cohen showed, though the documents do not say whether any of Mr. Trump's advisers were aware of the Russian disruption effort. According to a grand jury indictment made public this year, Russian intelligence operatives hacked the emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman in March 2016. That same month, an obscure professor whom Mr. Mueller's team has identified as a likely cutout for Russian intelligence began courting a Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos. Mr. Cohen admitted that the discussions about Trump Tower Moscow went on for at least six months after he had told Congress they had ended. They lasted until at least June 14, 2016, when Mr. Cohen met in New York with an associate who had been trying to arrange his trip to Russia, and told him he would not be traveling ""at that time,"" court documents said. Mr. Cohen also discussed the deal in a 20-minute phone call with a Russian government employee. That same day, The Washington Post reported that Russian operatives had infiltrated the computer network of the Democratic National Committee — the first public evidence of Moscow's campaign to disrupt the election. United States of America v. Michael Cohen: the special counsel's charges against Michael D. Cohen related to the Russia investigation. (PDF, 10 pages, 0.3 MB) Mr. Cohen said on Thursday that he discussed the status of the project with Mr. Trump on more than the three occasions he had previously acknowledged and briefed Mr. Trump's family members about it. Some of those exchanges, which continued until January 2016, included the president's children Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., both of whom are executives at the Trump Organization, according to three people familiar with the documents that the company turned over to Mr. Mueller's team. In one email exchange in 2015, Ms. Trump made a suggestion about the architecture, according to two of the people familiar with the messages. Donald Trump Jr. appeared to have replied to only one message, saying ""Cool"" in response to an update about the project, the people said. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen discussed Mr. Trump himself traveling to Russia after the Republican National Convention, though that trip never materialized. Mr. Trump defended his role in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, brushing aside concerns that he was advancing his business interests at the time he was hoping to become president. ""There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?"" he said to reporters as he left Washington for the Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires. ""We decided — I decided ultimately — not to do it,"" he said, adding, ""There would have been nothing wrong if I did do it."" Roger J. Stone Jr., one of six Trump advisers convicted in cases stemming from the investigation by the special counsel, was sentenced to more than three years in prison. Mr. Trump accused his former fixer of lying to receive a reduced sentence for the crimes he has pleaded guilty to. Under his earlier plea agreement, Mr. Cohen faced about four to five years in prison. ""He was convicted of various things unrelated to us,"" Mr. Trump said, adding, ""He's a weak person and what he's trying to do is get a reduced sentence."" The proceedings in Lower Manhattan appeared to have global repercussions. After Mr. Cohen's appearance in court, Mr. Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia while both leaders are in Argentina. The president said he called off the meeting because of Russia's recent hostilities with Ukraine. [Read about Trump associates' connections with Russia and Ukraine.] The new revelations were certain to increase the strain between Mr. Trump and the Justice Department. In recent days, the president and his lawyers have increased their attacks on the department and the Russia investigation, including Mr. Mueller. This week, the special counsel's office accused Mr. Trump's onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, of repeatedly lying to investigators in breach of his plea agreement. The acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, was told of Mr. Cohen's impending plea Monday or earlier, a person familiar with the special counsel's investigation said. The White House learned of it late Wednesday, people close to Mr. Trump said. The new revelations also came a week after Mr. Trump's lawyers provided Mr. Mueller with written responses to a set of questions. The special counsel identified Mr. Cohen's false statements to Congress in testimony and materials that Mr. Cohen provided to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, which have been conducting their own investigations into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. ""There's a reason people shouldn't lie when they're in front of a congressional investigation,"" Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday. The committee's top Democrat, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, said that the panel had made additional criminal referrals to Mr. Mueller, but he gave no specifics. transcript ""He was given a fairly long jail sentence and he's a weak person. And by being weak, unlike other people that you watch, he's a weak person and what he's trying to do is get a reduced sentence. So, he's lying about a project that everybody knew about. I mean, we were very open with it. We were thinking about building a building. I guess we had it in a form. It was an option. I don't know what you'd call it. We decided, I decided ultimately, not to do it. When I run for president, that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to do business. I was doing a lot of different things when I was running. After I won, obviously, I don't do business — when — from Jan. 20."" Reporter: ""If Cohen is such a bum why did you hire him, have him on your payroll for 12 years and have him do so much of your dirty work?"" ""Because a long time ago, he did me a favor. A long time ago he did me a favor."" [Reporters shouting] Reporter: ""Is Michael Cohen a threat to your presidency?"" ""No, not at all."" Reporter: ""Are you worried about what he'll tell the special counsel?"" ""Not at all. I'm not worried at all about him. You just take a look at his written document. Go back, take a look at what he wrote in, I think, January. He has a written statement. And that's the fact."" Mr. Trump said on Thursday that discussions about the Moscow project took place in early 2016, but that he did not know exactly when he decided to stop pursuing it. [Read about Mr. Trump's attempts to chase business deals in Russia.] The president has previously said that there would be no problem if he continued to run his business from the White House. ""I have a no-conflict-of-interest provision as president,"" Mr. Trump said in January 2017, adding, ""I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've stayed away."" Mr. Cohen's new guilty plea in Federal District Court is the first time the office of the special counsel has charged him. In exchange for pleading guilty and continuing to cooperate with Mr. Mueller, he may hope to receive a lighter sentence. He is scheduled to be sentenced in two weeks. It is unclear what additional time he could face with the new guilty plea. During his plea hearing in August, Mr. Cohen admitted to making a $130,000 payment to an adult film actress, Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, to keep her quiet about an affair she said she had with Mr. Trump. The payment amounted to an illegal contribution to Mr. Trump's campaign, prosecutors argued, since her silence bolstered his election hopes and campaign finance law prohibits individuals from donating more than $2,700 to a presidential candidate. He said that the payments to Ms. Clifford and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, were made ""in coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for federal office"" — a reference to Mr. Trump. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Mr. Cohen's plea on Thursday only added urgency for congressional investigators who plan to begin an inquiry into Mr. Trump's foreign business dealings when Democrats take control of the House in January. ""If the president and his associates were being untruthful in real time as they were pursuing this deal,"" Mr. Schiff told reporters on Thursday, ""what does it mean now on how much we can rely on what the president is saying about any continuing Russian financial interest?"""
News,2018-11-30,"MIAMI — The sordid case against Jeffrey E. Epstein, who was accused of paying dozens of underage girls for sexual massages in Florida, appeared to end a decade ago. The wealthy New York financier struck a deal to avoid any federal criminal charges, enraging some of his victims who got no say in the agreement, which they deemed far too lenient.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/jeffrey-epstein-acosta-florida-sex-abuse.html,1248," MIAMI — The sordid case against Jeffrey E. Epstein, who was accused of paying dozens of underage girls for sexual massages in Florida, appeared to end a decade ago. The wealthy New York financier struck a deal to avoid any federal criminal charges, enraging some of his victims who got no say in the agreement, which they deemed far too lenient. But the victims and their lawyers have continued to fight in civil court, long after Mr. Epstein, who pleaded guilty to lesser state charges of soliciting prostitution, completed his sentence in a county lockup, registered as a sex offender and became a free man. Jury selection is scheduled to begin next week in a West Palm Beach, Fla., courtroom for a civil trial that — for the first time — could give Mr. Epstein's victims, who are now adults, a chance to publicly testify about their attempts to win justice after the sexual abuse they endured as children. Mr. Epstein's accusers could take the witness stand just days after a local investigative report published new details on how Mr. Epstein preyed on young teenage girls — and how prosecutors appeared to buckle to pressure from Mr. Epstein's high-powered defense lawyers to keep him from ever doing serious time in prison. The report published Wednesday by The Miami Herald reached all the way to the nation's capital: The former chief federal prosecutor in Miami who signed off on Mr. Epstein's plea deal, then-United States Attorney R. Alexander Acosta, is now President Trump's labor secretary. Mr. Acosta had recently been mentioned as a long-shot candidate to replace former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Acosta's critical role in accepting the 2007 nonprosecution agreement that protected Mr. Epstein from any federal charges was documented before Mr. Acosta's Senate confirmation hearing last year. But The Herald report, which quoted victims and police investigators who had never spoken publicly before, brought fresh scrutiny in the #MeToo era to the government's actions 11 years earlier. On Thursday, a Labor Department spokesman pointed to Mr. Acosta's past remarks on the Epstein case, including during his confirmation hearing in March 2017, and directed new questions to the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, which did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Acosta said at his confirmation hearing that the plea deal was the result of a ""broadly held"" consensus among prosecutors. ""At the end of the day, based on the evidence, professionals within a prosecutor's office decide that a plea that guarantees that someone goes to jail, that guarantees that someone register generally, and that guarantees other outcomes is a good thing,"" he said. In Florida, though, there was fresh outrage over the new interviews, in which young women described how Mr. Epstein had solicited girls as young as 14 and 15 for nude massages, which sometimes ended in masturbation, oral sex or, in at least one case, forcible rape. ""Where's the righteous indignation for these young women?"" said State Senator Lauren Book, a South Florida Democrat and survivor of childhood sexual abuse. ""Is it because he has a private plane? Is it because he has the money to be able to circumvent the system? Well, then that means the system is unfortunately broken, and we have to fix it."" During their investigation, law enforcement officers found that Mr. Epstein — a former hedge fund manager who was friendly with the likes of Prince Andrew, the Duke of York; former President Bill Clinton; and Mr. Trump — paid dozens of girls cash to engage in the illicit sexual activity. The encounters took place from 1999 to 2005 in Mr. Epstein's mansions in Palm Beach, New York and the United States Virgin Islands. Some of the girls were runaways or foster children without permanent homes; in some cases, Mr. Epstein would ask them to recruit other girls, his victims told the police. One girl told the F.B.I. in a 2007 interview that she began visiting Mr. Epstein when she was 15 to give him massages — first in her underwear, then in the nude — for $200 each, court records show. The massages turned increasingly sexual, and Mr. Epstein also had the victim, who was identified at the time only by her initials, C.W., because she was a minor, bring other girls who worked with her in a local strip club. The authorities identified more than 30 victims. In its latest report, The Herald located about 60 and spoke to four of them on the record — including Courtney Wild, who is now 31. ""Jeffrey preyed on girls who were in a bad way, girls who were basically homeless,"" Ms. Wild, who still wore braces when she first met Mr. Epstein, told The Herald. ""He went after girls who he thought no one would listen to and he was right."" Mr. Acosta's office drafted a 53-page federal indictment against Mr. Epstein that carried a potential punishment of up to life in prison. The indictment, however, was ultimately shelved. Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He registered as a sex offender, paid damages to victims and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County Stockade — the local jail — under an extraordinary arrangement that allowed him to leave and work out of his office six days a week. ""There was nothing normal about this case,"" said retired Police Chief Michael Reiter of Palm Beach, who said he had turned the investigation over to federal prosecutors when state prosecutors waffled on filing serious charges. ""So many people, primarily the victims, paid so dearly for how this was handled from the government."" Not one of Mr. Epstein's victims was initially informed of the nonprosecution agreement, whose terms called for it to be kept secret. It was not until afterward that victims and their lawyers learned that no federal prosecutions against Mr. Epstein would be initiated. The secret deal prompted two of the victims, identified in court records as ""Jane Doe 1"" and ""Jane Doe 2,"" to sue the government, claiming that the agreement had violated the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act, which grants victims the right to be informed of crucial steps during a prosecution, such as plea negotiations. (Ms. Wild is Jane Doe 1, according to The Herald.) Bradley J. Edwards, the lawyer representing Ms. Wild and other victims, wrote in a court filing that had the women known about the nonprosecution agreement, ""they would have taken steps to object"" to the deal, perhaps appearing in person to appeal to the judge to reject it. The victims' rights case, which began in 2008, is still pending. Mr. Edwards did not respond to an interview request on Thursday. The case set to begin with jury selection on Tuesday is a separate civil matter which also involves Mr. Edwards. He is suing Mr. Epstein claiming malicious prosecution; Mr. Epstein had earlier claimed that Mr. Edwards's civil cases involving the Epstein victims were helping to finance an unlawful Ponzi scheme being run by Scott Rothstein, a partner in Mr. Edwards's former law firm. Mr. Epstein dropped his lawsuit after Mr. Rothstein said Mr. Edwards was not involved in the financial scheme. Mr. Edwards then countersued. The lengthy pretrial proceedings have involved a number of depositions, including of Mr. Epstein, who has repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. Several of Mr. Epstein's victims are on the witness list, though when they could be called to testify remains unclear."
News,2018-11-30,"Updated, Dec. 6, 2018 with related student contest.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/learning/lesson-plans/the-past-is-present-strategies-for-bringing-current-events-into-the-social-studies-classroom.html,3029," Updated, Dec. 6, 2018 with related student contest. Why do we insist that students study history? Perhaps because the study of history promotes critical thinking, creates a shared cultural literacy or encourages responsible citizenship. Certainly one of the most important reasons is because history continues to matter. Why has North Korea developed a nuclear arsenal that threatens the United States? Why are thousands of Hondurans camped out on the southern border of the United States? Why have many athletes decided to kneel during the national anthem? To answer any of these questions — or the myriad others posed by the news every day — students will need to understand what happened in the past. In this teaching resource, we suggest different methods teachers can use to easily facilitate these connections. Each method is illustrated with two examples, one from global history and another from United States history, and each ends with a classroom challenge. The goal is to help this kind of thinking become a habit of mind for your students. To encourage them, we're running a contest from Dec. 6 to Jan. 21 that invites any teenager anywhere in the world to link a topic learned in school this semester with something in the news this year. The winners of last year's contest came up with ideas such as comparing the Chinese Exclusion Act to President Trump's ban of citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries. What connections might your students make? _________ transcript This is coming, and it is going to destroy our lives. So we cannot afford to stand on the sideline. And we will do everything, everything we can, to ensure that there is the land and the nation of Kiribati that will remain. For a long time I said there is nothing we can do. I was very angry. I was — there was a deep sense of futility, that no matter what I said, nobody's listening. Nobody's going to do anything about it. But I had to overcome that. And to overcome that, you've got to really throw away everything. Don't think in straight, linear terms. Take it all apart and think about doing something crazy, like building an island. [speaking Japanese] These floating islands, I know when I first thought about it, it was unrealistic. I know it's — in terms of the scale of thinking that we normally do in Kiribati. We don't think in those terms. With the machines and the technology that we have at our disposal, we keep thinking that we can continue to destroy this planet because we believe we can fix it with our technology. And our arrogance to believe that we have control of everything. The one thing, of course, that's been very difficult for our people in contemplating the possibility of moving and leaving their homeland is the deep link and connection with the spiritual world. Once we begin to build artificial structures, you will find that people who have left their indigenous homes and gone somewhere else seem to have lost that spiritual connection because they no longer regard themselves as being indigenous. [singing and music] If we leave Kiribati, then our ability to retain our culture as being distinct will no longer be very easy. Essential questions are, by definition, open-ended and big-picture, and using them in the history classroom encourages students to relate history to current events.Here are two examples. Global | How do geography and climate affect human life? Let's say you're studying the significance of geography in shaping the development of civilizations, perhaps in relation to the rise of ancient river valley civilizations. One way students can link these questions to current events is to take a close look at how climate change is affecting people around the world. One place to start is with the small Pacific island nation of Kiribati, which is slowly disappearing as ocean levels increase due to rising temperatures. You can use this eight-minute video to broach the subject, or perhaps a photo like this one from this slideshow to encourage student analysis as we do in our weekly ""What's Going On in This Picture?"" feature. With more time, you can introduce students to Kiribati via this article and photo essay. Student Challenge: Scan The Times to find other regions of the world where geography and climate are presenting new challenges or opportunities. Students then create annotated maps to document what they uncover. _________ U.S. | How much power should the president have? That's a question the authors of the Constitution wrestled with, and it's a question our society is debating today. And since Donald J. Trump was elected, a flurry of executive orders, court rulings, confirmation hearings and tussles with the press have made the question more relevant than ever. If students are connecting the role of past presidents such as George Washington, Andrew Jackson or Franklin D. Roosevelt to our current president, there is a constant stream of related Times articles for them to explore. These lesson plans link to some of the best: • Is Democracy at Risk? A Lesson Plan for U.S. and Global History Classes • Analyzing the Relationship Between the Press and the President: A Lesson Plan • Teaching and Learning About Governmental Checks and Balances and the Trump Administration Student Challenge: Here's a simple activity that can get students thinking about the power of the executive branch, and the role of checks and balances in our democracy: Have them look through the homepage of nytimes.com, or the first section of the print paper, and find articles about the president exercising his power. Then ask students to read closely to identify what institutions, groups or individuals are working to check that power. Finally, have the students explain how checks and balances are at work. _________ Like essential questions, themes in the history classroom encourage students to make connections across time periods and places. They are also relatively easy to use to identify related current events. Here are two examples you might consider using. Global | Human Rights Violations (or Religious Conflict) If you're studying 20th-century human tragedies like the Holocaust or the Rwandan genocide, students learn that human rights violations are unfortunately an enduring issue. The current persecution of the Rohingya clearly highlights that reality. In 2017, more than 720,000 Rohingya fled slaughter, rape and village burnings in Myanmar. Thousands were killed in the outbreak of ethnic cleansing. The United Nations has recommended that top military leaders in Myanmar be put on trial for crimes that include genocide. And today, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees live in crowded camps in Bangladesh, uncertain of their future. We have a lesson plan that uses Times reporting, videos, podcasts and photography to help students learn about the Rohingya crisis. The model also tackles universal questions about national identity, rights of minority groups and the responsibility of the global community. Student Challenge: Look through The Times to find more news about human rights violations around the world, or simply scroll through the Times topic page for ""Human Rights and Human Rights Violations."" For each violation they find, students can use our Problem-Solution Organizer (PDF) to detail what they read, as well as their own ideas about the issue. _________ U.S. | Immigration Whether it's the the first colonists who arrived from England, the forced migration of millions of Africans as slaves, the waves of European immigrants from Europe in the 19th century or the new wave of immigrants from around the world today, one thing is clear: The study of United States history is the study of immigration. And, of course, the issue dominates the front pages today, including in the coverage of the migrant caravans trekking across Mexico and the thousands of United States troops stationed on the southwestern border. We have done many lesson plans over the years on the topic, and we still like to recommend a classic New York Times interactive, The Immigration Explorer. Student Challenge: Use the Times topics page for ""Immigration and Emigration,"" to find a wealth of articles about immigration to the United States. But since this issue is often seen through a partisan lens, students can also go to the Op-Ed page to select an opinion piece written by a contributor to The Times about the subject. They can either scroll through the articles to find the most recent Op-Eds, or they can plug in a search term below where it says ""contributors"" and change the way the results are sorted to ""newest."" Once they find a piece that interests them, they can identify what argument the writer is making and then decide if they agree or disagree. For balance, they can look for another opinion piece that argues a different position, either in The Times or elsewhere, and decide which point of view they agree with most and why. What issues that we're still debating today were issues in the era they are studying? What images, quotes, data or other kinds of information can they find that might make interesting paired texts to link the two eras? _________ One of the easiest ways to find recent writing in The Times about a historical event and why it is still relevant today is to put the event into the search function. This will often bring up articles and essays that show how past events relate to present-day events, especially when one searches around the time of an important anniversary. For example, here is a lesson plan that pairs the Gettysburg Address with a 2013 opinion piece, ""Why the Civil War Still Matters."" Global | World War I The world just commemorated the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I. Katrin Bennhold writes about the unsettling similarities between 1914 and today: Now as then, Europe's political center is weak and the fringes are radicalizing. Nationalism, laced with ethnic hatred, has been gaining momentum. Populists sit in several European governments. She asks: Can Europe's liberal order survive as the memory of war fades? And we help guide students through related questions in this Article of the Day. Student Challenge: Students can look in The Times for any signs of the main causes of World War I today: militarism, alliances, imperialism and nationalism. What can they find? In what ways are these parallels similar to 1914, and in what ways are they different? _________ U.S. | Reconstruction Although Reconstruction took place 150 years ago, its impact is still being felt across the country — in college campus protests, the Black Lives Matter movement, an entrenched racial economic inequality and a longstanding voting rights battle. In 2015, we published a Text to Text lesson pairing Eric Foner's Op-Ed essay ""Why Reconstruction Matters"" with an excerpt from W.E.B. Du Bois's 1935 book ""Black Reconstruction in America."" Both texts document how biased historiography from the early 20th century has helped to perpetuate inequality and injustice for generations of Americans. Student Challenge: While the Civil War is commemorated extensively in the United States, and especially in the South, Reconstruction hasn't received a similar treatment. Mr. Foner writes: Reconstruction has long been misrepresented, or simply neglected, in our schools, and unlike Confederate generals and founders of the Ku Klux Klan, few if any monuments exist to the black and white leaders of that era. Students can read The Times to find how communities in the United States today are grappling with memory and symbolism from the Civil War and Reconstruction periods, especially after a 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., turned violent. How do they think these eras should be commemorated? Why? _________ Since social studies students spend a great deal of time exploring historic places, one easy way to make that study relevant to them is to have them discover what those places look like today, and how life there has either changed or stayed the same. What remnants of the past are still present? Why? Global | China (Silk Road) The network of trade routes known as the Silk Road helped make ancient China powerful and wealthy. Today, China is creating what could be called a new Silk Road through its Belt and Road Initiative, promising more than $1 trillion in infrastructure and spanning more than 60 countries. In ""The Land That Failed to Fail,"" Philip P. Pan writes: China now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union. In ""The World, Built by China,"" the authors write: China envisions a vast global network of trade, investment and infrastructure that will reshape financial and geopolitical ties — and bring the rest of the world closer to Beijing. Both articles are part of a Times series published this month, ""How China Became a Superpower,"" exploring China's recent rise. Student Challenge:  Have students look through The Times to find a photograph, illustration or graphic of some kind that they think helps tell the story about China's rise on the world stage. They might even create a gallery walk of such images, and challenge themselves and each other to comment on the images with ideas and questions about how present-day China relates to what they are learning about ancient China. _________ U.S. | Harlem Let's say your students are studying the Harlem Renaissance, the artistic and intellectual explosion that took place in the 1920s in New York's Harlem neighborhood. Well, perhaps your students want to know: What's going on in Harlem today? In 2010, Sam Roberts reported: For nearly a century, Harlem has been synonymous with black urban America. Given its magnetic and growing appeal to younger black professionals and its historic residential enclaves and cultural institutions, the neighborhood's reputation as the capital of black America seems unlikely to change soon. But the neighborhood is in the midst of a profound and accelerating shift. In greater Harlem, which runs river to river, and from East 96th Street and West 106th Street to West 155th Street, blacks are no longer a majority of the population — a shift that actually occurred a decade ago, but was largely overlooked. Student Challenge: Have your students find out what has changed, and what has stayed the same, in the region of the country they are studying. They can look for articles, maps, photographs, editorial cartoons and videos that document what life is like there now now. A good place to start searching is in  Lens, the Times photography section. Then, they might do the same activity we suggest in the section about ancient China above: create a ""then and now"" gallery walk that invites them to make connections between the two eras. _________ Historians' understanding of the past is typically grounded in what they glean from analyzing texts and artifacts. How are these still relevant today? Regular readers of The Times know that works of art, texts and structures created long ago are often featured in stories from the Politics, Travel or Arts sections as new generations discover them or reconsider their power and significance. Global | The Ruins of Ancient Rome When ISIS occupied Palmyra, the storied ancient city in Syria, in 2015, the group systematically demolished treasured ruins because it viewed the city's artifacts as sacrilegious symbols. Rick Gladstone writes: Islamic State propagandists considered Palmyra a bonanza for promoting their vision of a strictly religious caliphate devoid of homage to other cultures or religions. They publicized the work of their demolition teams with graphic photographs. When the Russians reclaimed the city in 2016, before losing it again, they organized a televised concert from the amphitheater, the same one used for executions by Islamic State militants. The Kremlin actually painted the effort as a victory of civilization over barbarity. Student Challenge: If you're studying an ancient empire, your students can hunt within The Times for ways ruins and artifacts from that empire still appear in sections across the paper today, either because of their symbolic power, their role as cherished cultural relics or their continued functionality. For example, what can they find if they search for the Acropolis in The Times? _________ U.S. | The Constitution While Americans generally agree that the First Amendment to the Constitution protects the freedom of speech, there are disagreements over when, where, how and if speech should be ever limited or restricted. A recent lesson plan we published in collaboration with the National Constitution Center encourages students to explore current issues related to free speech, such as whether they are allowed to protest by kneeling during the national anthem during school hours or while on school property. Student Challenge: Liberties protected by the First Amendment continue to be challenged and debated. Invite your students to find as many recent articles as they can that relate to the First Amendment and, for each, explain the constitutional issue at stake. You might then choose one or more of the issues currently in the news and stage a debate. _________ Global | Fascist Leaders Even though the rise of fascist leaders like Hitler and Mussolini pulled the world into the most destructive conflict in human history, World War II, the end of the war marked the end of fascism. Right? In many countries around the world, democracy has recently been dismantled or is being eroded by a strong elected leader and a ruling party. In a lesson plan published earlier this month, we asked students to study anti-democratic forces in three countries: Venezuela, Turkey and Hungary. But they could have easily looked elsewhere too, in countries like the Philippines, Nicaragua or Poland. Is the rise of a new crop of leaders with authoritarian tendencies in existing democracies a sign that fascism is on the rise again? Student Challenge: Ask students to scan The Times to find evidence of authoritarian, or even fascist-leaning, behavior by democratically elected leaders around the world. Before starting, they should define what authoritarianism and fascism look like. How will they recognize when a leader is acting undemocratically? Once they find some examples, have them compare what is going on in these countries now with how the country was governed in the past. _________ U.S. | Robber Barons American industrialists and business magnates in the late 19th century, like Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt and John D. Rockefeller, were called robber barons by critics because of ruthless business practices that helped make them incredibly wealthy. Are the tycoons who control Silicon Valley the robber barons of today? The Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo calls five of the companies they control — Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google — the ""Frightful 5"" because of how much influence these companies hold over our lives and how much they dominate the consumer technology sector. Student Challenge: Have students look for evidence in The Times for whether today's Silicon Valley tycoons are robber barons reinvented, and whether the mammoth companies they control behave like monopolies from another era. Before starting, students should define ""robber baron"" and ""monopoly"" in the context of the Gilded Age. Then they should compare and contrast the business practices of these five technology companies and their leaders with the original robber barons. What similarities and differences can they find? What lessons from the past are relevant today? _________ When School Gets Real: Teachers Connect Classroom Lessons to Current Events Making It Relevant: Helping Students Connect Their Studies to the World Today Making Connections: 50 Teenagers Suggest Creative Ways to Link Classic Texts to the World Today 50 Ways to Teach With Current Events _________ How do you embed current events in your social studies classroom?

The significance of the fabled ""pee tape,"" after all, is not that it would reveal Donald Trump to be a pervert bent on defiling the place where Barack Obama slept. Rather, the tape matters because, if real, it would show the president to be vulnerable to Russian blackmail.  That's also why evidence of Trump's business involvement with Russia would be significant, as Trump himself acknowledged shortly before his inauguration, when he tweeted, ""Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA — NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!"" We still don't know for certain if Russia has used leverage over Trump. But there should no longer be any doubt that Russia has leverage over him.  On Thursday morning, Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen — the former executive vice president of the Trump Organization — pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress about efforts to build a Trump-branded property in Moscow that extended into the 2016 presidential campaign. In an August 2017 letter to the House and Senate intelligence committees, Cohen said that the Moscow project ended in January 2016. He claimed not to recall contacts with Russian government officials about a potential deal. Cohen told Congress that he spoke about the project with Trump — identified as ""Individual 1"" in the criminal information document that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, filed on Thursday — only three times. He said he never briefed Trump's family. According to Mueller's filing, all of this was false. Efforts to obtain Russian government approval for a Trump-branded development in Moscow went on until ""approximately June 2016,"" after Trump had effectively secured the Republican nomination for president. Cohen, Mueller's document said, ""discussed the status and progress of the Moscow project with Individual 1"" more than three times. He also ""briefed family members of Individual 1 within the company about the project."" [Listen to ""The Argument"" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] In January 2016, according to Mueller's document, Cohen had a 20-minute conversation with the assistant to a Russian official in which he sought Russia's help moving the project forward. The next day, Felix Sater, a Trump associate identified in the court filing as ""Individual 2,"" wrote Cohen to tell him he'd heard from Putin's office. Cohen made plans to travel to Russia, calling them off only on June 14, which happened to be the day that The Washington Post first reported that Russian government hackers had penetrated Democratic National Committee computers. At one point, Cohen and Sater were also coordinating with figures in Moscow about a potential Trump visit in connection with the project. So we now know that Trump lied to the American people about at least one part of his business relationship with Russia, a geopolitical foe that interfered in our election process on his behalf. In a Jan. 11, 2017, news conference, Trump said that the ""closest I came to Russia"" was in selling a Palm Beach mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008. While we're just learning precisely how dishonest this was, Putin has known it all along. That means that throughout Trump's campaign and presidency, Putin has had the power to plunge him into political crisis. ""If the Russians are aware that senior American officials are publicly stating things that are not true, it's a counterintelligence nightmare,"" Adam Schiff, the California Democrat in line to take over the House Intelligence Committee, told me.  As he points out, this issue contributed to former national security adviser Michael Flynn's downfall. Flynn, you might remember, appeared to have lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. This alarmed Sally Yates, then the acting attorney general, because the Russians would have known that Flynn was deceiving Pence, and could have used that knowledge against him. ""Logic would tell you that you don't want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him,"" Yates told the Senate last year.  The same, said Schiff, ""is true in spades for the president of the United States."" Speaking to reporters before flying to Argentina on Thursday, Trump justified his pursuit of a Moscow project this way: ""There was a good chance that I wouldn't have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?"" This could be read as a confession of motive. In the 2016 campaign, Russia wanted to humiliate Hillary Clinton and delegitimize America's election. Trump wanted help building his brand. In light of some other recent revelations in the Mueller inquiry, we can even see Trump getting talking points, albeit indirectly, from Moscow.  This week, Jerome Corsi, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who appears to have been a conduit between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, released a copy of what he said was a draft statement of offense against him, given to him during plea negotiations with Mueller. On Aug. 2, 2016, Corsi wrote to Roger Stone, the political dirty trickster in frequent contact with Trump, about the ""word"" on coming document dumps from WikiLeaks. ""Would not hurt to start suggesting H.R.C. old, memory bad, has stroke,"" wrote Corsi.  Shortly afterward, Trump started making sustained attacks on Clinton's purported lack of ""mental and physical stamina."" (Corsi has since said, on MSNBC, that his apparent foreknowledge of WikiLeaks' plans came through a flash of divine intervention on a trans-Atlantic flight.) There are still many shoes to drop in this scandal. ""Given the extraordinary obsequiousness the president has shown in his relationship with Putin, it begs the question of whether there's more leverage than this,"" said Schiff. ""That's one of the reasons why we're so determined to make sure that we look into any credible allegations of financial entanglements, whether that involves potential Russian money laundering in the Trump Organization or anything else.""  But even before those inquiries begin, we can see that Putin has been in possession of crucial information about Trump's business interests that the president deliberately hid from the American people. In a normal political world, Republicans would have enough patriotism to find this alarming and humiliating. Every day of the Trump presidency is a national security emergency. The question now is whether Senate Republicans, who could actually do something about it, will ever be moved to care.

News,2018-11-30,"On Thursday, after Michael D. Cohen revealed new information about the Trump Organization’s business dealings with Russia, President Trump called his former personal lawyer a liar. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/fact-check-cohen-trump-.html,896," transcript ""I have nothing to do with Russia. I have — John, John, how many times do I have to say it? Are you a smart man? I have nothing to do with Russia. I have no relationship to Russia whatsoever."" ""No debts?"" ""No debts — I have very little debt to anybody. I don't deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia, folks. O.K.? I'll give you a written statement — nothing to do. First of all, I don't know Putin. Have no business whatsoever with Russia. Have nothing to do with Russia. They said maybe Donald Trump is involved in projects with the Russians. The answer is no, no. So he's lying about a project that everybody knew about. I mean, we were very open with it."" On Thursday, after Michael D. Cohen revealed new information about the Trump Organization's business dealings with Russia, President Trump called his former personal lawyer a liar.  ""He is a weak person,"" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. He added: ""Very simply, Michael Cohen is lying."" He was referring to Mr. Cohen pleading guilty to lying to Congress about a real estate deal to build a tower in Moscow.  But Mr. Trump, who is identified as ""Individual 1"" in court documents that accompanied Mr. Cohen's admission, was himself less than forthcoming about the prospective real estate project during the 2016 campaign.  At no time did Mr. Trump disclose that the Trump Organization had entered negotiations for the property, known as the Moscow Project. And evidence presented in the documents filed on Thursday contradicts Mr. Trump's repeated denials of his financial interests in Russia and his playing down of campaign contacts with Russian officials.  According to the documents, Mr. Cohen pursued the project through June 2016 — as Mr. Trump's presidential campaign gained momentum. At the time, Mr. Cohen served as executive vice president and special counsel for the Trump Organization, which he joined in 2007; he also was a frequent public mouthpiece for the Republican front-runner's campaign.  Here is the special counsel's account of the Trump Organization's efforts to build the Moscow tower, based on new information from Mr. Cohen, compared with what Mr. Trump has said about it.  [You can find the court documents here.] What The Charges Say The Moscow Project was discussed multiple times within the Company and did not end in January 2016. Instead, as late as approximately June 2016, COHEN and Individual 2 discussed efforts to obtain Russian governmental approval for the Moscow Project. COHEN discussed the status and progress of the Moscow Project with Individual 1 on more than the three occasions COHEN claimed to the Committee, and he briefed family members of Individual 1 within the Company about the project. What Mr. Trump Said On at least 23 occasions since the summer of 2016, Mr. Trump has said either that he had ""nothing"" to do with Russia, or that he has ""no deals,"" no investments and no ""business"" in Russia.  While the Moscow Project never materialized, Mr. Trump never disclosed that he had pursued the deal while running for president. In several instances, his denials were misleading by omission.  ""What do I have to do with Russia? You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach, Fla.,"" Mr. Trump said at a news conference on July 27, 2016, referring to a mansion he sold to a Russian businessman for $95 million in 2008.  Mr. Trump also repeatedly sought business opportunities in Russia over three decades.  (Repetitions in 2018: Oct. 29, Sept. 7, July 20, July 19, July 18, | Repetitions in 2017: July 25, July 19, May 13, May 11, Feb. 16, Feb. 7, Jan. 11, Jan. 11 | Repetitions in 2016: Oct. 27, Oct. 26, Oct. 25, Oct. 24, Oct. 12, Oct. 9, Sept. 16, July 31, July 26)  What the charges say COHEN did recall that in or around January 2016, COHEN received a response from the office of Russian Official 1, the Press Secretary for the President of Russia, and spoke to a member of that office about the Moscow Project. What Mr. Trump Said Mr. Cohen admitted that he called the assistant to the Russian president's spokesman, at a Moscow-based phone number, and spoke with her about the proposed tower.  Mr. Trump, however, has said at least six times that nobody on his campaign spoke to any Russians. He also has contradicted himself on that point, by describing aides who have admitted to having contact with Russians as ""low level"" or only briefly employed.  Asked by a reporter on Feb. 16, 2017, whether he was aware if anyone who advised his campaign had contacts with Russia during the campaign, Mr. Trump said his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, ""obviously was dealing.""  But other than Mr. Flynn, ""no, no, nobody that I know of,"" Mr. Trump answered.  ""I have nothing to do with Russia,"" he said. ""To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.""  (Repetitions in 2018: Oct. 16, Sept. 7, July 18 | Repetitions in 2017: Dec. 15, Feb. 27)  What the charges say COHEN agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the Moscow Project and took steps in contemplation of Individual 1's possible travel to Russia. COHEN and Individual 2 discussed on multiple occasions traveling to Russia to pursue the Moscow Project. What Mr. Trump Said At a news conference on Jan. 11, 2017, Mr. Trump dismissed a salacious dossier that, among other things, claimed that Mr. Cohen had traveled to Prague to meet with Russian officials.  While there is no proof that Mr. Cohen went to Prague on Mr. Trump's behalf, the lawyer did consider traveling to Russia, according to the charging documents.  According to the documents, Mr. Cohen asked Mr. Trump about the possibility of Mr. Trump himself traveling to Russia ""in connection with the Moscow Project."" Mr. Cohen also discussed going to Russia himself.  Kitty Bennett contributed research."

The G.D.P. is growing at about 3.5 percent a year, which is about a point faster than many experts thought possible. We're in the middle of the second-longest recovery in American history, and if it lasts for another eight months it will be the longest ever. If you were born in 1975, you've seen the U.S. economy triple in size over the course of your lifetime. The gains are finally being widely shared, even by the least skilled. As Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute recently noted, the median usual weekly earnings for workers who didn't complete high school shot up by 6.5 percent over the past year. Thanks mostly to government transfer programs, incomes for the bottom fifth of society have increased by about 80 percent over the past four decades. And yet are we happy? About 60 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in this country. Researchers with the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index interviewed 160,000 adults in 2017 to ask about their financial security, social relationships, sense of purpose and connectedness to community. Last year turned out to be the worst year for well-being of any since the study began 10 years ago. As the recovery has advanced, people's faith in capitalism has actually declined, especially among the young. Only 45 percent of those between 18 and 29 see capitalism positively, a lower rate than in 2010, when the country was climbing out of the Great Recession. So why the long faces? Part of the problem is Donald Trump. People can't feel good about things when they think the country is disastrously led.  Part of it, as Noah Smith of Bloomberg theorizes, may be disappointment among the well-educated young. They graduated from college, saddled with debt, and naturally expected the world to embrace them as their parents and schools had done. Instead, many entered into the gig economy, where a lot of work is temporary and insecure. Normal professions for liberal arts grads, like the law, are drying up.  How many unpaid internships can you endure before you lose faith in the system? But the biggest factor is the crisis of connection. People, especially in the middle- and working-class slices of society, are less likely to volunteer in their community, less likely to go to church, less likely to know their neighbors, less likely to be married than they were at any time over the past several decades. In short, they have fewer resources to help them ride the creative destruction that is ever-present in a market economy. And they are dying. On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that life expectancy in the United States declined for the third straight year. This is an absolutely stunning trend. In affluent, well-connected societies, life expectancies rise almost as a matter of course. The last time the American mortality rate fell for three straight years was 1915-1918, during World War I and the flu pandemic, which took 675,000 American lives. And yet here we are — a straight-up social catastrophe. Economic anxiety is now downstream from and merged with sociological, psychological and spiritual decay. There are thousands of employers looking for workers and unable to find any. Many young people do not have the support structures they need to persevere in school and get skills.  Many working-class men have not been raised in those relationships that inculcate the so-called soft skills. A 2018 LinkedIn survey of 4,000 professionals found that training for those soft skills — leadership, communication and collaboration — was the respondents' highest priority. They valued these flexible skills more than specific technical ones, and find them in short supply. There's an interesting debate going on in conservative circles over whether we have overvalued total G.D.P. growth in our economic policy and undervalued programs that specifically foster dignity-enhancing work. The way I see it is this: It's nonsense to have an economic policy — or any policy — that doesn't account for and address the social catastrophe happening all around us. Every single other issue exists under the shadow of this one. Conservatives were wrong to think that economic growth would lead to healthy families and communities all by itself. Moderate Democrats were wrong to think it was sufficient to maximize growth and then address inequalities with transfer payments. The progressives are wrong to think life would be better if we just made our political economy look more like Denmark's. The Danes and the Swedes take for granted a cohesive social fabric that simply does not exist here. To make the crucial differences, economic policymakers are going to have to get out of the silos of their economic training and figure out how economic levers can have moral, communal and sociological effect. Oren Cass's book ""The Once and Future Worker"" begins this exploration, as do Isabelle Sawhill's ""The Forgotten Americans"" and Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse's ""Them: Why We Hate Each Other — and How to Heal.""

News,2018-11-30,"Sheryl Sandberg asked Facebook’s communications staff to research George Soros’s financial interests in the wake of his high-profile attacks on tech companies, according to three people with knowledge of her request, indicating that Facebook’s second in command was directly involved in the social network’s response to the liberal billionaire.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/technology/george-soros-facebook-sheryl-sandberg.html,1049," Sheryl Sandberg asked Facebook's communications staff to research George Soros's financial interests in the wake of his high-profile attacks on tech companies, according to three people with knowledge of her request, indicating that Facebook's second in command was directly involved in the social network's response to the liberal billionaire. Ms. Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, asked for the information in an email to a senior executive in January that was forwarded to other senior communications and policy staff, the people said. The email came within days of a blistering speech Mr. Soros delivered that month at the World Economic Forum, attacking Facebook and Google as a ""menace"" to society and calling for the companies to be regulated. Ms. Sandberg — who was at the forum, but was not present for Mr. Soros's speech, according to a person who attended it — requested an examination into why Mr. Soros had criticized the tech companies and whether he stood to gain financially from the attacks. At the time, Facebook was under growing scrutiny for the role its platform had played in disseminating Russian propaganda and fomenting campaigns of hatred in Myanmar and other countries. Facebook later commissioned a campaign-style opposition research effort by Definers Public Affairs, a Republican-linked firm, which gathered and circulated to reporters public information about Mr. Soros's funding of American advocacy groups critical of Facebook. Those efforts, revealed this month in a New York Times investigation, set off a public relations debacle for Ms. Sandberg and for Facebook, which was accused of trafficking in anti-Semitic attacks against the billionaire. Facebook quickly fired Definers. The people with knowledge of Ms. Sandberg's email asked for anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the message and feared retribution. In a statement, Facebook said that the company had already begun researching Mr. Soros when Ms. Sandberg made her request. ""Mr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,"" the company said. ""That research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook's stock."" The company said that while Ms. Sandberg ""takes full responsibility for any activity that happened on her watch,"" she did not personally direct any research on Freedom from Facebook, an anti-Facebook coalition whose members were among the subjects of Definers' later work. Eddie Vale, a spokesman for Freedom from Facebook, said he was skeptical of the company's account. ""In light of Sandberg's continuously changing story on the Soros research, there's no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value,"" Mr. Vale said. ""Facebook must immediately release any emails and any research about targeting the Freedom from Facebook coalition or any member organizations."" The revelation complicates Ms. Sandberg's shifting explanations of her role in Facebook's decisions to hire Definers and go on the offensive against the social network's growing legion of critics. Ms. Sandberg at first denied knowing that Facebook had hired Definers, before acknowledging in a post last week that some of the company's work for Facebook had crossed her desk. In that post, Ms. Sandberg did not explicitly deny that she had asked for research into Mr. Soros. Instead, a deputy who oversaw the communications team but is now leaving the company, Elliot J. Schrage, took responsibility for hiring Definers and initiating Definers' investigation into Mr. Soros. It is unclear what, if any, involvement Ms. Sandberg had in that ultimate response to Mr. Soros. ""We had not heard such criticism from him before and wanted to determine if he had any financial motivation,"" Mr. Schrage said of Mr. Soros. ""Definers researched this using public information."" Facebook has defended its inquiries into Mr. Soros as a prudent and necessary step for any public company under attack by a high-profile figure — particularly one like Mr. Soros, a onetime currency trader who made a fortune in the 1990s betting against the British pound. But the revelations are likely to escalate pressure on Ms. Sandberg, an embattled Silicon Valley star and feminist author. The Times investigation found that Ms. Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, had ignored warnings about abuse on the platform and sought to conceal from public view evidence that Russia had used it to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign and help elect President Trump. The Times also found that when Facebook was confronted last spring with revelations that the privacy of tens of millions of users had been compromised by Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-linked data firm, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg sought to downplay the problem and deflect blame. But it is Ms. Sandberg who oversees Facebook's policy and communications arms, which starting last year embarked on a hard-edged lobbying campaign to discredit the company's critics and push back on the growing chorus of voices calling for Facebook and other big tech companies to be broken up or more tightly regulated. Some have called on Ms. Sandberg to be fired. Last week's admission by Mr. Schrage — a Sandberg confidante who announced in June that he was leaving the company — was widely viewed inside and outside the company as an effort to insulate her from damage. Facebook hired Definers last year to monitor media coverage and then expanded its role to include campaign-style research and other public relations work. In a private meeting on Thursday, Ms. Sandberg again distanced herself from Definers and its research into Mr. Soros, according to Rashad Robinson, head of the racial-justice group Color of Change, which was named in a Definers memo about Mr. Soros. Mr. Robinson said that while meeting with Ms. Sandberg, she denied hiring Definers or directing the firm's research. ""She very much placed it on the now departed communications chief"" — Mr. Schrage — ""and also worked to assure us that Joel Kaplan had nothing to do with it either,"" Mr. Robinson said. Mr. Kaplan is the company's vice president of global public policy. Mr. Robinson said he was pleased Ms. Sandberg had agreed to release a progress report on a previously announced internal audit into how Facebook's policies affected minority users and employees. But when he pushed for more on Facebook's involvement with Definers, Mr. Robinson said, Ms. Sandberg kept stressing that Facebook had fired the firm. ""We were not satisfied with that answer,"" he said."
briefing,2018-11-30,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/briefing/michael-cohen-ukraine-deutsche-bank.html,1516," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Michael Cohen's surprise revelation, Ukraine's appeal to NATO and a five-week church service (and counting). Here's the latest: • Trump's former lawyer pleads guilty. Michael Cohen, President Trump's onetime fixer and personal lawyer, admitted to lying to Congress about Mr. Trump's unrealized plans for a Trump-branded skyscraper in Moscow, pursued at the height of the 2016 presidential campaign. Above, Mr. Cohen leaving court in Manhattan after making his guilty plea. Mr. Cohen said he had falsely minimized the business venture to protect Mr. Trump. The deal raises the question of whether Mr. Trump's conciliatory stance on Russia during the campaign was partly motivated by his business interests. Shortly after Mr. Cohen's plea, Mr. Trump, citing Russia's detention of captured Ukrainian soldiers, canceled a planned get-together with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. They had been scheduled to meet this week in Argentina, where leaders from the Group of 20 are meeting. Our journalists revealed new details about Trump Tower Moscow. Mr. Cohen and a former Russian intelligence officer, led by a felon named Felix Sater, maneuvered for many months — even engaging the Kremlin. _____ • Ukraine appeals for NATO support. The country's president, Petro Poroshenko, called for NATO ships to steam into the Sea of Azov, arguing for an aggressive response from the West after Russia fired on three Ukrainian Navy vessels, captured them and jailed their sailors. Above, a Ukrainian soldier on the Azov Sea in Mariupol, Ukraine, a port city that the Ukrainian government claimed Thursday had been blockaded by a Russian cargo stoppage in the narrow Kerch Strait, the site of the attack. ""Putin wants the old Russian Empire back,"" Mr. Poroshenko said in an interview with a German newspaper. ""Crimea, eastern Ukraine, he wants the whole country."" But Ukraine is not a member of NATO, and moving NATO ships into disputed waters would risk catastrophic war with Russia. NATO commanders have said such action is unlikely.  _____ • Hungary cements media control. A holding company controlled by close associates of the country's far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, could be the new owner of hundreds of private Hungarian media outlets. Above, Mr. Orban speaking in Budapest last month. The 400 news websites, newspapers, television channels and radio stations were donated to the holding company by more than a dozen media owners in coordinated announcements. If the deal is approved by regulators — led by an official appointed by Mr. Orban — it would create an arrangement that rights observers say will be unique within the European Union: a member nation with most of its leading media outlets under state control. _____ • A nonstop church service.  Bethel Church in The Hague, above, is carrying out a kind of filibuster to protect an Armenian family that, after living for nine years in the Netherlands and three times being granted asylum in earlier rulings, was denied asylum. For five weeks and counting, the church has been holding a marathon service, shielding the family with a Dutch law that generally prevents the authorities from conducting operations in a place where a religious service is being held. The service has captured national attention, creating a snowball effect that has made the logistics easier: Hundreds of pastors from around the country, and even some from other nations, have volunteered to preach during the service. The Tamrazyan family — two parents and their three children, ages 21, 19 and 14 — is staying in an apartment in the church. The family says it will be endangered in Armenia because of political activism by the father. _____ • A business with no end. A student told our writer that his parents in California were receiving mysterious packages at their house. Each was addressed to ""Returns Department, Valley Fountain LLC."" That led the writer on a journey through bizarre Amazon storefronts selling everything from hemorrhoid creams to a book on industrial electricity. All the LLCs had something in common: Their registered agent was the same man. When our writer kept digging, she found more connections, to Newsweek, a department store in New York and a church. And the story kept getting stranger.

News,2018-11-30,"BREAUX BRIDGE, La. — Bryson Sassau’s application would inspire any college admissions officer. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/us/tm-landry-college-prep-black-students.html,4688," BREAUX BRIDGE, La. — Bryson Sassau's application would inspire any college admissions officer.  A founder of T.M. Landry College Preparatory School described him as a ""bright, energetic, compassionate and genuinely well-rounded"" student whose alcoholic father had beaten him and his mother and had denied them money for food and shelter. His transcript ""speaks for itself,"" the founder, Tracey Landry, wrote, but Mr. Sassau should also be lauded for founding a community service program, the Dry House, to help the children of abusive and alcoholic parents. He took four years of honors English, the application said, was a baseball M.V.P. and earned high honors in the ""Mathematics Olympiad."" The narrative earned Mr. Sassau acceptance to St. John's University in New York. There was one problem: None of it was true.  ""I was just a small piece in a whole fathom of lies,"" Mr. Sassau said. T.M. Landry has become a viral Cinderella story, a small school run by Michael Landry, a teacher and former salesman, and his wife, Ms. Landry, a nurse, whose predominantly black, working-class students have escaped the rural South for the nation's most elite colleges. A video of a 16-year-old student opening his Harvard acceptance letter last year has been viewed more than eight million times. Other Landry students went on to Yale, Brown, Princeton, Stanford, Columbia, Dartmouth, Cornell and Wesleyan.  Landry success stories have been splashed in the past two years on the ""Today"" show, ""Ellen"" and the ""CBS This Morning."" Education professionals extol T.M. Landry and its 100 or so kindergarten-through-12th-grade students as an example for other Louisiana schools. Wealthy supporters have pushed the Landrys, who have little educational training, to expand to other cities. Small donors, heartened by the web videos, send in a steady stream of cash. transcript A high school student in front of a laptop, surrounded by classmates, dressed in college gear. A moment of suspense, and then … [Cheers] It was a scene repeated over and over again. Students from one Louisiana private school opening acceptance letters from their dream colleges. The videos often went viral. This one, of a 16-year-old student getting accepted to Harvard, racked up over 8 million views. [Cheers] But there was more to the story. Students told us many of their college applications included false information provided by their school's administrators. And the cheers in these videos covered up an ugly reality of abuse and intimidation at T.M. Landry College Prep. ""Abusing emotionally, physically. We realized, O.K. something's not right. Everything is wrong with T.M. Landry."" Sixteen-year-old Megan Malveaux is a former student. ""There was this little kid, he was probably about 7 or 8, and he was acting up in class. Mr. Mike, he had took the kid by the neck and picked him up and body slammed him on the table."" Mr. Mike is Michael Landry. He and his wife, Tracey, founded the school. It costs up to $725 a month to attend, and received national attention for its 100 percent college acceptance rate. In various TV interviews, they pitched a message of hope and hard work. ""We're changing society. We're giving hope."" ""Go big or go home."" The Landrys denied falsifying transcripts and college applications, and any allegations of abuse. But they do maintain that physical punishments are doled out because they love their students and treat them like family. The Landrys told the story of young black kids from a working-class community, who overcame systemic barriers to achieve success. ""Doesn't matter who you are, doesn't matter where you've been in life, you can do it."" And the videos were crucial in promoting that message. Parents say they had no idea what was going on. ""All the videos, I was excited for all the kids, because they're kids. Little black kids like us can go to Harvard, Yale."" ""I mean, the good talking he did made you realize, well, you're kid needs to go to that school. If you want the best for your kid, you need to send them to T.M. Landry. You know, you speak to anybody in Louisiana, they're telling you."" When the cameras were off, students say they were pitted against each other, interrogated and humiliated. Students say they were also physically punished. Sometimes they would be forced to kneel on rocks, rice or hot concrete, for hours. ""I remember the first time I was put on my knees was because he gave me a test and I failed it."" A New York Times investigation found that behind the scenes, the Landrys filled out transcripts incorrectly to reflect classes the kids say they never took and grades they never earned. ""My transcript was messed up because he messed up my birthday because apparently I was born the year my mom was. He put classes that I never even took, like chemistry."" Students told The Times that the Landrys told them to lie on their college applications about growing up in households marked by poverty, crime and drug addiction. If they refused, they say the Landrys threatened to do it for them. A look back reveals clues about Michael Landry's temperament, like in this recent pitch that became a passionate outburst. [Bangs fist] ""Excuse me, ma'am."" But this was a rare glimpse at his frightening tone. The Landrys produced a steady stream of promotional material, painting a positive picture of an unconventional school. ""T.M. Landry is a no-frills school."" ""No classrooms, no walls, no books."" ""Teachers without certifications. Classes with no teachers at all."" After the acceptance videos started gaining traction in 2016, press from around the country started showing up at their door. ""Walking around campus, we saw that weird Landry style."" Outsiders marveled at how the Landrys could make the impossible happen. ""So, O.K. this is incredible."" ""The results speak for themselves."" ""Go Landrys —"" ""They have figured out the secret sauce —"" ""They really have."" In media interviews, they called themselves a family — ""Family first —"" that pushed kids to their academic limits. ""They will make it. No is not an option. Failure is not an option."" Former students and parents told us that for visits like these, students would be forced to spend days rehearsing what to say to reporters. ""I plan to attend Harvard University."" ""Harvard University."" ""Stanford University."" ""Cornell."" ""Brown."" ""We have this trig book, which is like from M.I.T., so we just basically teach each other."" For the high school students, there was a singular focus: practicing for the ACT. For younger kids: a loose and insufficient curriculum that has left many grade levels behind. When their methods were questioned, the Landrys were quick to dismiss any suspicions. ""Some of them sound a little brainwashed."" ""When it's a black kid and it's strictly education, something's wrong with that kid."" ""The reason why I never said nothing was because I was scared. Because they were getting all of this attentions from news channels. They were in articles. I was so brainwashed and I was thinking, he can't do no wrong. But as you can see since I'm sitting here, I was all wrong."" Now, many in the T.M. Landry community say they feel swindled out of time, money, and ironically, an education. In reality, the school falsified transcripts, made up student accomplishments and mined the worst stereotypes of black America to manufacture up-from-hardship tales that it sold to Ivy League schools hungry for diversity. The Landrys also fostered a culture of fear with physical and emotional abuse, students and teachers said. Students were forced to kneel on rice, rocks and hot pavement, and were choked, yelled at and berated.  The Landrys' deception has tainted nearly everyone the school has touched, including students, parents and college admissions officers convinced of a myth.  The colleges ""want to be able to get behind the black kids going off and succeeding, and going to all of these schools,"" said Raymond Smith Jr., who graduated from T.M. Landry in 2017 and enrolled at N.Y.U. He said that Mr. Landry forced him to exaggerate his father's absence from his life on his N.Y.U. application.  ""It's a good look,"" these colleges ""getting these bright, high-flying, came-from-nothing-turned-into-something students,"" Mr. Smith said. This portrait of T.M. Landry emerged from interviews with 46 people: parents of former Landry students; current and former students; former teachers; and law enforcement agents. The New York Times also examined student records and court documents showing that Mr. Landry and another teacher at the school had pleaded guilty to crimes related to violence against students, and police records that included multiple witness statements saying that Mr. Landry hit children. The Breaux Bridge Police Department closed the case after deciding it was outside of its jurisdiction. ""That dream you see on television, all those videos,"" said Mr. Sassau's mother, Alison St. Julien, ""it's really a nightmare."" In an interview with The Times, the Landrys denied falsifying transcripts and college applications, but Mr. Landry admitted that he hit students and could be rough. ""Oh, I yell a lot,"" he said. He goads black and white students to compete against one another because that is how the real world works, he said.  In 2013, Mr. Landry was sentenced to probation and attended an anger management program after pleading guilty to a count of battery. Despite the documentation, he insisted that he did not plead guilty or serve probation. Mr. Landry said that the victim was a student whose mother asked him to hit her child, and he said he had eased up on physical punishments. ""I don't do that anymore,"" he said. Instead, he calls himself a ""drill sergeant"" or ""coach,"" and asks children to kneel before him to learn humility, for five minutes at most, Mr. Landry said.  That is not how the students have experienced it. Tyler Sassau, Mr. Sassau's brother, said he can still feel the humiliation and smell the stench on his clothes from kneeling last year on a bathroom floor for nearly two hours. ""I wasn't going to get up without asking him because if I did, I could've got something worse,"" he said. ""I could barely stand when I got up."" In their defense, the Landrys touted the school's ACT scores and high graduation and college enrollment statistics. ""We get pushed under the microscope, or under the dagger,"" Mr. Landry said, because ""it had been just black kids going. Society kept saying all these negative things about us because it was just easy to beat this broken-down school."" The students who navigated the Landrys' system and made it to the nation's top colleges now face their own quandaries.  ""I really believe that we all thought we were doing the right thing at the time, and didn't have a choice,"" Mr. Smith said. ""It was a cultish mentality.""  T.M. Landry produced its first graduating class in 2013, and since then, 50 students have graduated, according to the school's promotional materials. They have had mixed success in college. Some alumni, especially those who spent only a short time at T.M. Landry, have been successful. Bryson Sassau did well in his classes at St. John's, although he had to quit some advanced science and math courses. Mr. Smith also did well, but with debts mounting had to drop out after his freshman year. Another Landry graduate said he feels at home at Brown in his junior year, has maintained good grades and was recently accepted into a program that prepares students to pursue a doctoral degree.  The student in the most viral video, who spent only a short time at Landry, is in his first semester at Harvard. Other Landry students have been admitted to Harvard over the past three years, but the university declined to provide information on their status. For yet other Landry students, particularly those who spent multiple years at the school, the results after graduation have been disappointing. Some have withdrawn from college, or transferred to less rigorous programs.  Asja Jackson, whose Wesleyan University acceptance video also went viral, decided to leave this month after she said she fell into a depression over her first-semester struggles. She said she ""froze and failed"" her first chemistry tests and walked out of a biology exam. Her papers, she said, were ""childish,"" and she was too embarrassed to attend a writing workshop.  She studied and worked through the night, like she had done at T.M. Landry since eighth grade, but she just was not ""catching it,"" she said. She said she eventually stopped eating, talking to her friends, leaving her room or going to class.  ""I didn't understand why people around me were doing well, and I wasn't,"" said Ms. Jackson, who took the advice of her dean and started medical leave. ""I couldn't tell my friends because they would say, 'How did you get into the school then?' There were too many questions that I couldn't answer."" At least five T.M. Landry families spoke with local law enforcement, and two more contacted the local education authorities for aid, but little changed.  Ashlee McFarlane, a lawyer at Gerger Khalil & Hennessy in Houston, said dozens of parents, students and staff have left the school and are reaching out to her for help.  ""Above all,"" Ms. McFarlane said, ""they want to protect their children and to finally be heard."" Mr. Landry, 49, and Ms. Landry, 50, say that education lifted them from their impoverished childhoods in Breaux Bridge, near Lafayette. Ms. Landry got a nursing degree. Mr. Landry got his bachelor's degree from the University of Southwestern Louisiana, which was later renamed the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He was a salesman and, from 2002 through 2004, a certified teacher. The couple started T.M. Landry in 2005 as a home-school for their son and five children. The early results were not good. Two of the six students ended up in prison, Mr. Landry said. But the couple continued to recruit students from area churches, telling parishioners that teaching was their calling. T.M. Landry, now an unaccredited private school, settled last year into a bare-bones factory building that Mr. Landry has compared to his students: abandoned and run down, but loved by him. By taking no government funding, the school falls into a narrow category of educational institutions that the state does not regulate or approve, said Erin Bendily, the assistant superintendent of policy and governmental affairs at the Louisiana Department of Education. Some T.M. Landry diplomas say that students meet Louisiana state requirements, but the state does not recognize the diplomas. ""So what, we're not accredited,"" Mr. Landry said at a recruiting event this year. ""Three years in a row, Harvard took us. Stanford has taken us.""  Mr. Landry said he does not participate in state scholarship programs or accept any other funding because it would impair his ability to run the school in a ""nontraditional"" way. Over the years, Mr. Landry has appealed to parents whose children were struggling, bored or ignored in their public and private schools. He told them that his school had special programs for students with disabilities. Parents said he took a deep interest in their lives, called their children ""baby girl"" and ""baby boy,"" and shared personal stories about his own family members who had struggles with drugs or had been in prison. Mr. Landry used to tout the school as created for ""black troublemakers."" As it became more prominent, it started to appeal to local doctors, paralegals and small-business owners. Some white and Asian families also enrolled their children. Black families thought that the Landrys were fighting to give their children a fair shot in a world that often believed they were only capable of being sports stars. Mr. Landry's mantra: ""Why play for a team when you can own the team?"" ""The fact that he was black, I was like, 'Man, he's going to uplift these kids,'"" said Doresa Barton, whose three children were enrolled at Landry until this year.  ""He got us on the unity,"" said Letarchia Lewis, a parent, and he capitalized on ""a disadvantage that you know we are all a part of."" The students cleaned the school, taught younger children, stayed into the night and attended year-round. Nearly every day they would call and respond ""I love you"" in several languages, and Mr. Landry said the word ""kneel"" meant ""I love you"" in his own language, ""Mike-a-nese."" Parents said that they were told to feed and clothe their children — and that Mr. Landry would take care of the rest. Apprehensive families were placated by videos of students solving tough math problems and being accepted to college. ""When you see these videos,"" Ms. Lewis said, ""you want that."" After each viral video and media appearance, donors including wealthy executives and older Americans on fixed incomes sent money. T.M. Landry took in more than $250,000 in donations this year, a portion of which was earmarked by the donors for tuition assistance, according to records of the donations obtained by The Times. But the school has not yet offered any scholarships, said Greg Davis, a T.M. Landry board member. Mr. Landry said donations were put into a general account, but he declined to say how the money was spent. To many T.M. Landry families, tuition is not cheap — about $600 a month, or $7,200 annually. Mr. Landry's annual salary has averaged about $86,000, according to four bankruptcy filings, which he says were driven by all of the tuition that he and his wife have covered. The days start at T.M. Landry with a morning meeting, chants and pep talks, a ritual meant to ""center"" students and help them find their voice and confidence, Mr. Landry said.  The school is based loosely on a Montessori model that emphasizes mastery, so classes are optional, the Landrys said. Younger students described their education as learning from computer programs and YouTube videos. Instructors and textbooks are on hand, but the students teach one another. Math and English lessons are taught by the Landrys, who devote most of their attention to older students preparing for the ACT. Select students take dual-enrollment courses at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette. Adam Broussard, a Landry parent, noticed last fall that his 8-year-old, who had attended the school since he was 3, was writing ""chicken scratch."" Mr. Broussard had been happy with the school — his older son had been admitted to Brown after two years at Landry — but he confronted Mr. Landry about his younger son's progress. Mr. Landry responded that he did not teach sentence structure and just wanted students to love to write. An independent assessment at Sylvan Learning Center revealed that Mr. Broussard's younger son was performing two grade levels behind. ""I gave him my son for six years, almost every day, 12 months of the year,"" Mr. Broussard said of Mr. Landry. ""The longer these kids stayed there, the further behind they were."" News of the Broussard boy's low test scores spread last fall, and at least eight parents interviewed by The Times had their own students assessed. Of their 11 students, only two were performing at grade level, while the rest had fallen behind or made no progress. One junior was performing at a fourth-grade level in reading and math.  Dodie Thomas, a T.M. Landry grandmother, said she discovered that her 6-year-old granddaughter had never learned phonics and that she could not read. She played with Legos most of the day.  ""I feel like I've paid for a high-priced babysitter,"" Ms. Thomas said. Middle and high school students said they mostly completed worksheets that were recycled every few weeks. They came to recognize the failures in the school.  ""It was like building a house on water,"" Tyler Sassau said.  High school students took ACT practice tests day after day and sporadically attended classes. Bryson Sassau, who took the ACT three times, said that once he got to college, he realized an education that revolved around test preparation had ill-served him. ""If it wasn't on the ACT, I didn't know it,"" he said. The Landrys recruited their own family members and parents of students to serve as instructors. They also pulled in staff from other schools by promising them that they would get rich through consulting jobs or owning one of their own T.M. Landry schools one day. Tanika Williams was hired to teach philosophy last year. She took pride in her lessons, but said that because students were not required to attend class, some showed up infrequently. ""I would look at kids literally walking around all day,"" she said. At least a half-dozen staff members resigned. Among those remaining was Keidrick Owens, who had been accused at his previous school of instructing older students to whip younger students with a belt. Last fall, Mr. Owens pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor and was sentenced to 18 months' probation. When Mr. Landry's booming voice would ring through the school — ""I'M GETTING MAD!"" — students scurried to get out of his path. More than a dozen students and staff members told The Times of pupils being humiliated in front of their peers and of racial groups being pitted against one another. Academically weak students were demeaned, and headstrong students were made to kneel. More than a half-dozen students interviewed said they had witnessed Mr. Landry choking their schoolmates, and three students observed him slam others on desks. Another three students said they saw Mr. Landry place a child with autism in a closet. Nyjal Mitchell, 16, said he wanted to be accepted by Mr. Landry because he dreamed of attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He cleaned the school. He stayed later than others. He competed fiercely with his classmates. He said he even ignored attacks on his younger sister, Sanaa, who was bullied. ""I just clicked with the idea of doing something with my life,"" Mr. Mitchell said. ""I had the idea that the only way that would happen was through the school.""  Mr. Mitchell and his parents filed complaints against Mr. Landry in February 2017 with the Breaux Bridge police, detailing what they said were three instances of assault against the young Mr. Mitchell — choking, shoving and dragging. In the family statements to the police, Nyjal Mitchell reported that he also saw Mr. Landry choke three other students, including one with autism. The police conducted an investigation into the alleged assaults, which witnesses said took place from late 2016 to January 2017. The inquiry included witness statements from three students and one teacher.  ""Nyjal attempted to remove Mike's hand due to him turning red,"" one student said, according to the police report.  In another episode cited in the report, Mr. Landry dragged Mr. Mitchell by his hoodie across a concrete floor, put his foot on Mr. Mitchell's throat and made Mr. Mitchell kneel.  Mr. Mitchell said he believed the punishment was a ""normal"" part of being a T.M. Landry student.  ""He had my son broken,"" said his mother, Mary Mitchell. During the investigation, the Breaux Bridge police determined the episodes happened beyond city limits, so the case was referred to the local sheriff, whose office did not comment on its status.  Mr. Landry told students that he would ruin their futures if they left the school or told anyone what happened there, according to 20 current and former students interviewed and Terica Fuselier, a former teacher. They said that Mr. Landry threatened to alter or withhold their transcripts, or force them to enroll in a lower grade. Retaliation was a constant worry for students and teachers, Ms. Fuselier said.  Megan Malveaux, 16, said she believes she received a mediocre transcript from T.M. Landry because she chose to leave the school. An original and a revised document, which had different birth dates, include courses she never took.  Kelvin Simon said that when he found out the school wanted to submit a fraudulent transcript for his daughter's application to Yale, he told Mr. Landry that he would not pay tuition until the school produced a real transcript. Mr. Landry refused, and Mr. Simon withdrew his daughter in October. After Thanksgiving, Mr. Landry tried to bargain with him: In exchange for an accurate transcript, Mr. Simon would pay no tuition but keep his daughter in the school, according to texts reviewed by The Times. Mr. Landry also advised Mr. Simon to state that his income was below $65,000 on financial aid forms to qualify for a scholarship. Mr. Simon's daughter chose to withdraw her application to Yale rather than apply through T.M. Landry, which she no longer trusted.  Mr. Landry also convinced students that he had special relationships with college deans, particularly at Harvard, and that he could use them to help students get into college — or to keep them out. He told students that college officers observed them through the school's security cameras, and that the universities were so involved with the school that they set T.M. Landry's tuition rates.  ""Alleged statements made by Mr. Landry seriously misrepresent his relationship, and that of the T.M. Landry School, with the Harvard College admissions office,"" said Rachael Dane, a Harvard spokeswoman. Dartmouth and Stanford said that they had no role in the operations of T.M. Landry. St. John's, Wesleyan, Cornell and N.Y.U. also said that they had no special relationship with Landry. Claims of observing the school through security cameras were absurd, the colleges said. ""We will look into the issues raised by this reporting,"" said John H. Beckman, a spokesman at N.Y.U. A half-dozen current and former students said that Mr. Landry told them to lie on their college applications. In exchange for students' loyalty, Mr. Landry produced glowing transcripts, including what several students said were high marks in advanced coursework they never took.  ""He was pulling all of the information out of thin air,"" Bryson Sassau said. Only this week did Mr. Sassau see the application that the Landrys submitted to St. John's on his behalf. He was stunned and angry about the fabrications. His father paid child support and had never beat him nor his mother, unlike the abusive parent described.  Bryson Sassau had never started an organization called the Dry House — he had never even heard of it — and had never taken the classes or earned the accolades listed.  A recommendation from his English teacher praising his debate skills twice referred to another student.  ""They didn't even care about me enough to have the decency to change my name,"" Mr. Sassau said.  The Landrys said that they have never falsified information on transcripts or college applications. Instead, Mr. Landry said, he encouraged students to ""go deep"" on their personal statements, and not to hide their struggles. He would edit the statements, he said, or tell them if he did not agree with their approach.  With the exception of federal financial aid forms, each parent interviewed said they never saw their child's college application.  The joy was real. The first recorded Ivy League acceptance appeared to come from Brown in 2013. It was just one student in a cramped room, his classmate filming behind him. It had five comments and two shares. In 2016, the first year T.M. Landry secured several Ivy League acceptances, the videos were of higher quality and included reaction shots from students in Ivy League sweatshirts. ""It became this thing where it was no longer about a family,"" Mr. Sassau said. ""It was more so about publicity."" Students and parents noticed the biggest shift when T.M. Landry moved in early 2017. The school's population grew as the Landrys began recruiting high-performing students from other schools, particularly those with high ACT scores. Visitors and cameras paraded through what had become a Potemkin village. Students and teachers rehearsed in the days before a visitor came, often the same lessons — down to the math problems displayed on the board — that they had run for the last visitor. Students who came to school had to have pristine shoes, fresh hairdos and their scripts ready — name, grade, college aspiration and major. The pressure to paint a positive picture of the school continued even after students left T.M. Landry. When Ms. Jackson reached out to the Landrys to share her struggles at Wesleyan, she said they encouraged her to ""stay on the path."" If not for that advice, she said would have left school earlier.  ""They kept telling me that I had to stick it out, and show my school that T.M. Landry is for real,"" she said.  Some students still cry when they discuss their experiences at T.M. Landry. ""I really should have said something,"" Ms. Malveaux said. ""This isn't what I wanted my life to be or what I want it to be about. I didn't want to be part of the lies, and watching kids be abused and not do anything. I was so brainwashed."" Parents have been consumed with guilt. ""It's a tough pill to swallow,"" Doresa Barton said. ""You always like to think you would never let anything happen to your children."" Ms. Thomas, the grandmother, said she felt like the Landrys preyed on their own community. ""We expect that of other people, but we had an African-American who was one of us and seemed to be doing right by us, and it was a sham,"" she said. After T.M. Landry hit a high of 180 students last year, parents say that enrollment plunged after a July meeting in which Mr. Landry called them a racial slur. Mr. Davis, the board member, blamed the drop on an ""onslaught of negativity.""  Several parents are paying for tutoring or have enrolled their children in home-schools to help them catch up. Mr. Mitchell is among several students who never received a transcript. Last year, he was required to take ninth- and 10th-grade classes at his public high school. This year, he is doing 10th- and 11th-grade coursework. ""To do all that work and still end up behind, it's kind of a slap in the face,"" he said. He still wants to attend M.I.T.  ""I just want people to know what I went through,"" Mr. Mitchell said. Ms. Lewis, a Landry parent of three, said that her son Dawson, who has Asperger's syndrome, left T.M. Landry for another private school this fall, and that he had finally found peers who embraced his quirkiness. Teachers did not make fun of him for having Encopresis, a condition where he soils himself when he is nervous, that had earned him the nickname ""Mr. Smelly Man"" from Mr. Landry. But her son had to leave his new school after about two months because administrators there never received his transcript from the Landrys. ""Their love for my child went as far as my wallet would go for them,"" Ms. Lewis said. ""All there is to prove that they were at T.M. Landry is check stubs."" The Landrys said that they withhold transcripts only when families do not pay their tuition. They declined to address any specific families or situations. This month, the Landrys announced that they would open another school in the town of Opelousas, about 45 minutes from Breaux Bridge. The announcement rattled T.M. Landry families. ""How do you look your son in the face every day and tell him that this person is going to get what's coming to him, or he's going to get his punishment, when every other day you see something else that this person is doing, or they're on to another school, or he's on TV?"" Ms. Mitchell said. The graduates face an uncertain future. Mr. Smith at N.Y.U. and Bryson Sassau at St. John's both plan to take G.E.D. exams as a precaution after hearing that other Landry graduates left their colleges to return to Louisiana — only to find that their high school diplomas were not accepted at local colleges or for internships. Mr. Smith now works in the emergency room at a hospital in Louisiana. He believes he will go back to college, but he worries about other students, particularly his younger brother, who is a student at T.M. Landry. ""I don't want this to keep happening to kids,"" he said. ""I don't want parents to keep putting their kids in this abusive situation."" Mr. Sassau had a severe seizure because of his epilepsy on campus this past spring, and St. John's allowed him to take medical leave. He is set to return in January.  ""I don't know what's going to happen,"" Mr. Sassau said. ""I just want to go to school."" Ms. Jackson said that she hopes to enroll at a college in the South, closer to home. Just before Thanksgiving, The Times went to the school to see if the Landrys would take part in a follow-up interview. The couple agreed, but entered the conference room with about two dozen students who fielded many of the questions. ""Write whatever you want to write about us on the negative side,"" Mr. Landry told a reporter. ""But at the end of the day, my sister, if we got kids at Harvard every day, I'm going to fight for Harvard. Why is it O.K. that Asians get to Harvard? Why is it O.K. that white people get to Harvard?"" Mr. Landry raised his voice. He accused The Times of saying that it was wrong for T.M. Landry to want the best for its black students. He told his students that he would always fight for them. ""We need the haters,"" he said. ""I welcome the haters."" He raised his arms on either side of him, forming a cross. ""My name is Michael Landry. I am the reformer,"" he said. ""They killed Jesus Christ because he could save the world. I say to myself, who are you compared to Jesus? Nothing! So I stick my arms out and say nail me to the cross if that's what you want."" Mr. Landry slipped into the familiar call-and-response with his students. ""In English,"" he commanded them.  ""I love you,"" they said. ""In Mandarin,"" he yelled.  ""Wo ai ni,"" they said. ""In Russian!""  ""Ya lyublyu vas!"" ""In Tagalog!""  ""Mahal kita!"" ""In Mike-a-nese!"" ""Kneel,"" they shouted. ""In Mike-a-nese!""  ""Kneel!"" Doris Burke contributed research."
Interactive Feature,2018-11-30,Did you stay up to date this week?,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/30/briefing/30weeklynewsquiz.html,0," BREAUX BRIDGE, La. — Bryson Sassau's application would inspire any college admissions officer.  A founder of T.M. Landry College Preparatory School described him as a ""bright, energetic, compassionate and genuinely well-rounded"" student whose alcoholic father had beaten him and his mother and had denied them money for food and shelter. His transcript ""speaks for itself,"" the founder, Tracey Landry, wrote, but Mr. Sassau should also be lauded for founding a community service program, the Dry House, to help the children of abusive and alcoholic parents. He took four years of honors English, the application said, was a baseball M.V.P. and earned high honors in the ""Mathematics Olympiad."" The narrative earned Mr. Sassau acceptance to St. John's University in New York. There was one problem: None of it was true.  ""I was just a small piece in a whole fathom of lies,"" Mr. Sassau said. T.M. Landry has become a viral Cinderella story, a small school run by Michael Landry, a teacher and former salesman, and his wife, Ms. Landry, a nurse, whose predominantly black, working-class students have escaped the rural South for the nation's most elite colleges. A video of a 16-year-old student opening his Harvard acceptance letter last year has been viewed more than eight million times. Other Landry students went on to Yale, Brown, Princeton, Stanford, Columbia, Dartmouth, Cornell and Wesleyan.  Landry success stories have been splashed in the past two years on the ""Today"" show, ""Ellen"" and the ""CBS This Morning."" Education professionals extol T.M. Landry and its 100 or so kindergarten-through-12th-grade students as an example for other Louisiana schools. Wealthy supporters have pushed the Landrys, who have little educational training, to expand to other cities. Small donors, heartened by the web videos, send in a steady stream of cash. transcript A high school student in front of a laptop, surrounded by classmates, dressed in college gear. A moment of suspense, and then … [Cheers] It was a scene repeated over and over again. Students from one Louisiana private school opening acceptance letters from their dream colleges. The videos often went viral. This one, of a 16-year-old student getting accepted to Harvard, racked up over 8 million views. [Cheers] But there was more to the story. Students told us many of their college applications included false information provided by their school's administrators. And the cheers in these videos covered up an ugly reality of abuse and intimidation at T.M. Landry College Prep. ""Abusing emotionally, physically. We realized, O.K. something's not right. Everything is wrong with T.M. Landry."" Sixteen-year-old Megan Malveaux is a former student. ""There was this little kid, he was probably about 7 or 8, and he was acting up in class. Mr. Mike, he had took the kid by the neck and picked him up and body slammed him on the table."" Mr. Mike is Michael Landry. He and his wife, Tracey, founded the school. It costs up to $725 a month to attend, and received national attention for its 100 percent college acceptance rate. In various TV interviews, they pitched a message of hope and hard work. ""We're changing society. We're giving hope."" ""Go big or go home."" The Landrys denied falsifying transcripts and college applications, and any allegations of abuse. But they do maintain that physical punishments are doled out because they love their students and treat them like family. The Landrys told the story of young black kids from a working-class community, who overcame systemic barriers to achieve success. ""Doesn't matter who you are, doesn't matter where you've been in life, you can do it."" And the videos were crucial in promoting that message. Parents say they had no idea what was going on. ""All the videos, I was excited for all the kids, because they're kids. Little black kids like us can go to Harvard, Yale."" ""I mean, the good talking he did made you realize, well, you're kid needs to go to that school. If you want the best for your kid, you need to send them to T.M. Landry. You know, you speak to anybody in Louisiana, they're telling you."" When the cameras were off, students say they were pitted against each other, interrogated and humiliated. Students say they were also physically punished. Sometimes they would be forced to kneel on rocks, rice or hot concrete, for hours. ""I remember the first time I was put on my knees was because he gave me a test and I failed it."" A New York Times investigation found that behind the scenes, the Landrys filled out transcripts incorrectly to reflect classes the kids say they never took and grades they never earned. ""My transcript was messed up because he messed up my birthday because apparently I was born the year my mom was. He put classes that I never even took, like chemistry."" Students told The Times that the Landrys told them to lie on their college applications about growing up in households marked by poverty, crime and drug addiction. If they refused, they say the Landrys threatened to do it for them. A look back reveals clues about Michael Landry's temperament, like in this recent pitch that became a passionate outburst. [Bangs fist] ""Excuse me, ma'am."" But this was a rare glimpse at his frightening tone. The Landrys produced a steady stream of promotional material, painting a positive picture of an unconventional school. ""T.M. Landry is a no-frills school."" ""No classrooms, no walls, no books."" ""Teachers without certifications. Classes with no teachers at all."" After the acceptance videos started gaining traction in 2016, press from around the country started showing up at their door. ""Walking around campus, we saw that weird Landry style."" Outsiders marveled at how the Landrys could make the impossible happen. ""So, O.K. this is incredible."" ""The results speak for themselves."" ""Go Landrys —"" ""They have figured out the secret sauce —"" ""They really have."" In media interviews, they called themselves a family — ""Family first —"" that pushed kids to their academic limits. ""They will make it. No is not an option. Failure is not an option."" Former students and parents told us that for visits like these, students would be forced to spend days rehearsing what to say to reporters. ""I plan to attend Harvard University."" ""Harvard University."" ""Stanford University."" ""Cornell."" ""Brown."" ""We have this trig book, which is like from M.I.T., so we just basically teach each other."" For the high school students, there was a singular focus: practicing for the ACT. For younger kids: a loose and insufficient curriculum that has left many grade levels behind. When their methods were questioned, the Landrys were quick to dismiss any suspicions. ""Some of them sound a little brainwashed."" ""When it's a black kid and it's strictly education, something's wrong with that kid."" ""The reason why I never said nothing was because I was scared. Because they were getting all of this attentions from news channels. They were in articles. I was so brainwashed and I was thinking, he can't do no wrong. But as you can see since I'm sitting here, I was all wrong."" Now, many in the T.M. Landry community say they feel swindled out of time, money, and ironically, an education. In reality, the school falsified transcripts, made up student accomplishments and mined the worst stereotypes of black America to manufacture up-from-hardship tales that it sold to Ivy League schools hungry for diversity. The Landrys also fostered a culture of fear with physical and emotional abuse, students and teachers said. Students were forced to kneel on rice, rocks and hot pavement, and were choked, yelled at and berated.  The Landrys' deception has tainted nearly everyone the school has touched, including students, parents and college admissions officers convinced of a myth.  The colleges ""want to be able to get behind the black kids going off and succeeding, and going to all of these schools,"" said Raymond Smith Jr., who graduated from T.M. Landry in 2017 and enrolled at N.Y.U. He said that Mr. Landry forced him to exaggerate his father's absence from his life on his N.Y.U. application.  ""It's a good look,"" these colleges ""getting these bright, high-flying, came-from-nothing-turned-into-something students,"" Mr. Smith said. This portrait of T.M. Landry emerged from interviews with 46 people: parents of former Landry students; current and former students; former teachers; and law enforcement agents. The New York Times also examined student records and court documents showing that Mr. Landry and another teacher at the school had pleaded guilty to crimes related to violence against students, and police records that included multiple witness statements saying that Mr. Landry hit children. The Breaux Bridge Police Department closed the case after deciding it was outside of its jurisdiction. ""That dream you see on television, all those videos,"" said Mr. Sassau's mother, Alison St. Julien, ""it's really a nightmare."" In an interview with The Times, the Landrys denied falsifying transcripts and college applications, but Mr. Landry admitted that he hit students and could be rough. ""Oh, I yell a lot,"" he said. He goads black and white students to compete against one another because that is how the real world works, he said.  In 2013, Mr. Landry was sentenced to probation and attended an anger management program after pleading guilty to a count of battery. Despite the documentation, he insisted that he did not plead guilty or serve probation. Mr. Landry said that the victim was a student whose mother asked him to hit her child, and he said he had eased up on physical punishments. ""I don't do that anymore,"" he said. Instead, he calls himself a ""drill sergeant"" or ""coach,"" and asks children to kneel before him to learn humility, for five minutes at most, Mr. Landry said.  That is not how the students have experienced it. Tyler Sassau, Mr. Sassau's brother, said he can still feel the humiliation and smell the stench on his clothes from kneeling last year on a bathroom floor for nearly two hours. ""I wasn't going to get up without asking him because if I did, I could've got something worse,"" he said. ""I could barely stand when I got up."" In their defense, the Landrys touted the school's ACT scores and high graduation and college enrollment statistics. ""We get pushed under the microscope, or under the dagger,"" Mr. Landry said, because ""it had been just black kids going. Society kept saying all these negative things about us because it was just easy to beat this broken-down school."" The students who navigated the Landrys' system and made it to the nation's top colleges now face their own quandaries.  ""I really believe that we all thought we were doing the right thing at the time, and didn't have a choice,"" Mr. Smith said. ""It was a cultish mentality.""  T.M. Landry produced its first graduating class in 2013, and since then, 50 students have graduated, according to the school's promotional materials. They have had mixed success in college. Some alumni, especially those who spent only a short time at T.M. Landry, have been successful. Bryson Sassau did well in his classes at St. John's, although he had to quit some advanced science and math courses. Mr. Smith also did well, but with debts mounting had to drop out after his freshman year. Another Landry graduate said he feels at home at Brown in his junior year, has maintained good grades and was recently accepted into a program that prepares students to pursue a doctoral degree.  The student in the most viral video, who spent only a short time at Landry, is in his first semester at Harvard. Other Landry students have been admitted to Harvard over the past three years, but the university declined to provide information on their status. For yet other Landry students, particularly those who spent multiple years at the school, the results after graduation have been disappointing. Some have withdrawn from college, or transferred to less rigorous programs.  Asja Jackson, whose Wesleyan University acceptance video also went viral, decided to leave this month after she said she fell into a depression over her first-semester struggles. She said she ""froze and failed"" her first chemistry tests and walked out of a biology exam. Her papers, she said, were ""childish,"" and she was too embarrassed to attend a writing workshop.  She studied and worked through the night, like she had done at T.M. Landry since eighth grade, but she just was not ""catching it,"" she said. She said she eventually stopped eating, talking to her friends, leaving her room or going to class.  ""I didn't understand why people around me were doing well, and I wasn't,"" said Ms. Jackson, who took the advice of her dean and started medical leave. ""I couldn't tell my friends because they would say, 'How did you get into the school then?' There were too many questions that I couldn't answer."" At least five T.M. Landry families spoke with local law enforcement, and two more contacted the local education authorities for aid, but little changed.  Ashlee McFarlane, a lawyer at Gerger Khalil & Hennessy in Houston, said dozens of parents, students and staff have left the school and are reaching out to her for help.  ""Above all,"" Ms. McFarlane said, ""they want to protect their children and to finally be heard."" Mr. Landry, 49, and Ms. Landry, 50, say that education lifted them from their impoverished childhoods in Breaux Bridge, near Lafayette. Ms. Landry got a nursing degree. Mr. Landry got his bachelor's degree from the University of Southwestern Louisiana, which was later renamed the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He was a salesman and, from 2002 through 2004, a certified teacher. The couple started T.M. Landry in 2005 as a home-school for their son and five children. The early results were not good. Two of the six students ended up in prison, Mr. Landry said. But the couple continued to recruit students from area churches, telling parishioners that teaching was their calling. T.M. Landry, now an unaccredited private school, settled last year into a bare-bones factory building that Mr. Landry has compared to his students: abandoned and run down, but loved by him. By taking no government funding, the school falls into a narrow category of educational institutions that the state does not regulate or approve, said Erin Bendily, the assistant superintendent of policy and governmental affairs at the Louisiana Department of Education. Some T.M. Landry diplomas say that students meet Louisiana state requirements, but the state does not recognize the diplomas. ""So what, we're not accredited,"" Mr. Landry said at a recruiting event this year. ""Three years in a row, Harvard took us. Stanford has taken us.""  Mr. Landry said he does not participate in state scholarship programs or accept any other funding because it would impair his ability to run the school in a ""nontraditional"" way. Over the years, Mr. Landry has appealed to parents whose children were struggling, bored or ignored in their public and private schools. He told them that his school had special programs for students with disabilities. Parents said he took a deep interest in their lives, called their children ""baby girl"" and ""baby boy,"" and shared personal stories about his own family members who had struggles with drugs or had been in prison. Mr. Landry used to tout the school as created for ""black troublemakers."" As it became more prominent, it started to appeal to local doctors, paralegals and small-business owners. Some white and Asian families also enrolled their children. Black families thought that the Landrys were fighting to give their children a fair shot in a world that often believed they were only capable of being sports stars. Mr. Landry's mantra: ""Why play for a team when you can own the team?"" ""The fact that he was black, I was like, 'Man, he's going to uplift these kids,'"" said Doresa Barton, whose three children were enrolled at Landry until this year.  ""He got us on the unity,"" said Letarchia Lewis, a parent, and he capitalized on ""a disadvantage that you know we are all a part of."" The students cleaned the school, taught younger children, stayed into the night and attended year-round. Nearly every day they would call and respond ""I love you"" in several languages, and Mr. Landry said the word ""kneel"" meant ""I love you"" in his own language, ""Mike-a-nese."" Parents said that they were told to feed and clothe their children — and that Mr. Landry would take care of the rest. Apprehensive families were placated by videos of students solving tough math problems and being accepted to college. ""When you see these videos,"" Ms. Lewis said, ""you want that."" After each viral video and media appearance, donors including wealthy executives and older Americans on fixed incomes sent money. T.M. Landry took in more than $250,000 in donations this year, a portion of which was earmarked by the donors for tuition assistance, according to records of the donations obtained by The Times. But the school has not yet offered any scholarships, said Greg Davis, a T.M. Landry board member. Mr. Landry said donations were put into a general account, but he declined to say how the money was spent. To many T.M. Landry families, tuition is not cheap — about $600 a month, or $7,200 annually. Mr. Landry's annual salary has averaged about $86,000, according to four bankruptcy filings, which he says were driven by all of the tuition that he and his wife have covered. The days start at T.M. Landry with a morning meeting, chants and pep talks, a ritual meant to ""center"" students and help them find their voice and confidence, Mr. Landry said.  The school is based loosely on a Montessori model that emphasizes mastery, so classes are optional, the Landrys said. Younger students described their education as learning from computer programs and YouTube videos. Instructors and textbooks are on hand, but the students teach one another. Math and English lessons are taught by the Landrys, who devote most of their attention to older students preparing for the ACT. Select students take dual-enrollment courses at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette. Adam Broussard, a Landry parent, noticed last fall that his 8-year-old, who had attended the school since he was 3, was writing ""chicken scratch."" Mr. Broussard had been happy with the school — his older son had been admitted to Brown after two years at Landry — but he confronted Mr. Landry about his younger son's progress. Mr. Landry responded that he did not teach sentence structure and just wanted students to love to write. An independent assessment at Sylvan Learning Center revealed that Mr. Broussard's younger son was performing two grade levels behind. ""I gave him my son for six years, almost every day, 12 months of the year,"" Mr. Broussard said of Mr. Landry. ""The longer these kids stayed there, the further behind they were."" News of the Broussard boy's low test scores spread last fall, and at least eight parents interviewed by The Times had their own students assessed. Of their 11 students, only two were performing at grade level, while the rest had fallen behind or made no progress. One junior was performing at a fourth-grade level in reading and math.  Dodie Thomas, a T.M. Landry grandmother, said she discovered that her 6-year-old granddaughter had never learned phonics and that she could not read. She played with Legos most of the day.  ""I feel like I've paid for a high-priced babysitter,"" Ms. Thomas said. Middle and high school students said they mostly completed worksheets that were recycled every few weeks. They came to recognize the failures in the school.  ""It was like building a house on water,"" Tyler Sassau said.  High school students took ACT practice tests day after day and sporadically attended classes. Bryson Sassau, who took the ACT three times, said that once he got to college, he realized an education that revolved around test preparation had ill-served him. ""If it wasn't on the ACT, I didn't know it,"" he said. The Landrys recruited their own family members and parents of students to serve as instructors. They also pulled in staff from other schools by promising them that they would get rich through consulting jobs or owning one of their own T.M. Landry schools one day. Tanika Williams was hired to teach philosophy last year. She took pride in her lessons, but said that because students were not required to attend class, some showed up infrequently. ""I would look at kids literally walking around all day,"" she said. At least a half-dozen staff members resigned. Among those remaining was Keidrick Owens, who had been accused at his previous school of instructing older students to whip younger students with a belt. Last fall, Mr. Owens pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor and was sentenced to 18 months' probation. When Mr. Landry's booming voice would ring through the school — ""I'M GETTING MAD!"" — students scurried to get out of his path. More than a dozen students and staff members told The Times of pupils being humiliated in front of their peers and of racial groups being pitted against one another. Academically weak students were demeaned, and headstrong students were made to kneel. More than a half-dozen students interviewed said they had witnessed Mr. Landry choking their schoolmates, and three students observed him slam others on desks. Another three students said they saw Mr. Landry place a child with autism in a closet. Nyjal Mitchell, 16, said he wanted to be accepted by Mr. Landry because he dreamed of attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He cleaned the school. He stayed later than others. He competed fiercely with his classmates. He said he even ignored attacks on his younger sister, Sanaa, who was bullied. ""I just clicked with the idea of doing something with my life,"" Mr. Mitchell said. ""I had the idea that the only way that would happen was through the school.""  Mr. Mitchell and his parents filed complaints against Mr. Landry in February 2017 with the Breaux Bridge police, detailing what they said were three instances of assault against the young Mr. Mitchell — choking, shoving and dragging. In the family statements to the police, Nyjal Mitchell reported that he also saw Mr. Landry choke three other students, including one with autism. The police conducted an investigation into the alleged assaults, which witnesses said took place from late 2016 to January 2017. The inquiry included witness statements from three students and one teacher.  ""Nyjal attempted to remove Mike's hand due to him turning red,"" one student said, according to the police report.  In another episode cited in the report, Mr. Landry dragged Mr. Mitchell by his hoodie across a concrete floor, put his foot on Mr. Mitchell's throat and made Mr. Mitchell kneel.  Mr. Mitchell said he believed the punishment was a ""normal"" part of being a T.M. Landry student.  ""He had my son broken,"" said his mother, Mary Mitchell. During the investigation, the Breaux Bridge police determined the episodes happened beyond city limits, so the case was referred to the local sheriff, whose office did not comment on its status.  Mr. Landry told students that he would ruin their futures if they left the school or told anyone what happened there, according to 20 current and former students interviewed and Terica Fuselier, a former teacher. They said that Mr. Landry threatened to alter or withhold their transcripts, or force them to enroll in a lower grade. Retaliation was a constant worry for students and teachers, Ms. Fuselier said.  Megan Malveaux, 16, said she believes she received a mediocre transcript from T.M. Landry because she chose to leave the school. An original and a revised document, which had different birth dates, include courses she never took.  Kelvin Simon said that when he found out the school wanted to submit a fraudulent transcript for his daughter's application to Yale, he told Mr. Landry that he would not pay tuition until the school produced a real transcript. Mr. Landry refused, and Mr. Simon withdrew his daughter in October. After Thanksgiving, Mr. Landry tried to bargain with him: In exchange for an accurate transcript, Mr. Simon would pay no tuition but keep his daughter in the school, according to texts reviewed by The Times. Mr. Landry also advised Mr. Simon to state that his income was below $65,000 on financial aid forms to qualify for a scholarship. Mr. Simon's daughter chose to withdraw her application to Yale rather than apply through T.M. Landry, which she no longer trusted.  Mr. Landry also convinced students that he had special relationships with college deans, particularly at Harvard, and that he could use them to help students get into college — or to keep them out. He told students that college officers observed them through the school's security cameras, and that the universities were so involved with the school that they set T.M. Landry's tuition rates.  ""Alleged statements made by Mr. Landry seriously misrepresent his relationship, and that of the T.M. Landry School, with the Harvard College admissions office,"" said Rachael Dane, a Harvard spokeswoman. Dartmouth and Stanford said that they had no role in the operations of T.M. Landry. St. John's, Wesleyan, Cornell and N.Y.U. also said that they had no special relationship with Landry. Claims of observing the school through security cameras were absurd, the colleges said. ""We will look into the issues raised by this reporting,"" said John H. Beckman, a spokesman at N.Y.U. A half-dozen current and former students said that Mr. Landry told them to lie on their college applications. In exchange for students' loyalty, Mr. Landry produced glowing transcripts, including what several students said were high marks in advanced coursework they never took.  ""He was pulling all of the information out of thin air,"" Bryson Sassau said. Only this week did Mr. Sassau see the application that the Landrys submitted to St. John's on his behalf. He was stunned and angry about the fabrications. His father paid child support and had never beat him nor his mother, unlike the abusive parent described.  Bryson Sassau had never started an organization called the Dry House — he had never even heard of it — and had never taken the classes or earned the accolades listed.  A recommendation from his English teacher praising his debate skills twice referred to another student.  ""They didn't even care about me enough to have the decency to change my name,"" Mr. Sassau said.  The Landrys said that they have never falsified information on transcripts or college applications. Instead, Mr. Landry said, he encouraged students to ""go deep"" on their personal statements, and not to hide their struggles. He would edit the statements, he said, or tell them if he did not agree with their approach.  With the exception of federal financial aid forms, each parent interviewed said they never saw their child's college application.  The joy was real. The first recorded Ivy League acceptance appeared to come from Brown in 2013. It was just one student in a cramped room, his classmate filming behind him. It had five comments and two shares. In 2016, the first year T.M. Landry secured several Ivy League acceptances, the videos were of higher quality and included reaction shots from students in Ivy League sweatshirts. ""It became this thing where it was no longer about a family,"" Mr. Sassau said. ""It was more so about publicity."" Students and parents noticed the biggest shift when T.M. Landry moved in early 2017. The school's population grew as the Landrys began recruiting high-performing students from other schools, particularly those with high ACT scores. Visitors and cameras paraded through what had become a Potemkin village. Students and teachers rehearsed in the days before a visitor came, often the same lessons — down to the math problems displayed on the board — that they had run for the last visitor. Students who came to school had to have pristine shoes, fresh hairdos and their scripts ready — name, grade, college aspiration and major. The pressure to paint a positive picture of the school continued even after students left T.M. Landry. When Ms. Jackson reached out to the Landrys to share her struggles at Wesleyan, she said they encouraged her to ""stay on the path."" If not for that advice, she said would have left school earlier.  ""They kept telling me that I had to stick it out, and show my school that T.M. Landry is for real,"" she said.  Some students still cry when they discuss their experiences at T.M. Landry. ""I really should have said something,"" Ms. Malveaux said. ""This isn't what I wanted my life to be or what I want it to be about. I didn't want to be part of the lies, and watching kids be abused and not do anything. I was so brainwashed."" Parents have been consumed with guilt. ""It's a tough pill to swallow,"" Doresa Barton said. ""You always like to think you would never let anything happen to your children."" Ms. Thomas, the grandmother, said she felt like the Landrys preyed on their own community. ""We expect that of other people, but we had an African-American who was one of us and seemed to be doing right by us, and it was a sham,"" she said. After T.M. Landry hit a high of 180 students last year, parents say that enrollment plunged after a July meeting in which Mr. Landry called them a racial slur. Mr. Davis, the board member, blamed the drop on an ""onslaught of negativity.""  Several parents are paying for tutoring or have enrolled their children in home-schools to help them catch up. Mr. Mitchell is among several students who never received a transcript. Last year, he was required to take ninth- and 10th-grade classes at his public high school. This year, he is doing 10th- and 11th-grade coursework. ""To do all that work and still end up behind, it's kind of a slap in the face,"" he said. He still wants to attend M.I.T.  ""I just want people to know what I went through,"" Mr. Mitchell said. Ms. Lewis, a Landry parent of three, said that her son Dawson, who has Asperger's syndrome, left T.M. Landry for another private school this fall, and that he had finally found peers who embraced his quirkiness. Teachers did not make fun of him for having Encopresis, a condition where he soils himself when he is nervous, that had earned him the nickname ""Mr. Smelly Man"" from Mr. Landry. But her son had to leave his new school after about two months because administrators there never received his transcript from the Landrys. ""Their love for my child went as far as my wallet would go for them,"" Ms. Lewis said. ""All there is to prove that they were at T.M. Landry is check stubs."" The Landrys said that they withhold transcripts only when families do not pay their tuition. They declined to address any specific families or situations. This month, the Landrys announced that they would open another school in the town of Opelousas, about 45 minutes from Breaux Bridge. The announcement rattled T.M. Landry families. ""How do you look your son in the face every day and tell him that this person is going to get what's coming to him, or he's going to get his punishment, when every other day you see something else that this person is doing, or they're on to another school, or he's on TV?"" Ms. Mitchell said. The graduates face an uncertain future. Mr. Smith at N.Y.U. and Bryson Sassau at St. John's both plan to take G.E.D. exams as a precaution after hearing that other Landry graduates left their colleges to return to Louisiana — only to find that their high school diplomas were not accepted at local colleges or for internships. Mr. Smith now works in the emergency room at a hospital in Louisiana. He believes he will go back to college, but he worries about other students, particularly his younger brother, who is a student at T.M. Landry. ""I don't want this to keep happening to kids,"" he said. ""I don't want parents to keep putting their kids in this abusive situation."" Mr. Sassau had a severe seizure because of his epilepsy on campus this past spring, and St. John's allowed him to take medical leave. He is set to return in January.  ""I don't know what's going to happen,"" Mr. Sassau said. ""I just want to go to school."" Ms. Jackson said that she hopes to enroll at a college in the South, closer to home. Just before Thanksgiving, The Times went to the school to see if the Landrys would take part in a follow-up interview. The couple agreed, but entered the conference room with about two dozen students who fielded many of the questions. ""Write whatever you want to write about us on the negative side,"" Mr. Landry told a reporter. ""But at the end of the day, my sister, if we got kids at Harvard every day, I'm going to fight for Harvard. Why is it O.K. that Asians get to Harvard? Why is it O.K. that white people get to Harvard?"" Mr. Landry raised his voice. He accused The Times of saying that it was wrong for T.M. Landry to want the best for its black students. He told his students that he would always fight for them. ""We need the haters,"" he said. ""I welcome the haters."" He raised his arms on either side of him, forming a cross. ""My name is Michael Landry. I am the reformer,"" he said. ""They killed Jesus Christ because he could save the world. I say to myself, who are you compared to Jesus? Nothing! So I stick my arms out and say nail me to the cross if that's what you want."" Mr. Landry slipped into the familiar call-and-response with his students. ""In English,"" he commanded them.  ""I love you,"" they said. ""In Mandarin,"" he yelled.  ""Wo ai ni,"" they said. ""In Russian!""  ""Ya lyublyu vas!"" ""In Tagalog!""  ""Mahal kita!"" ""In Mike-a-nese!"" ""Kneel,"" they shouted. ""In Mike-a-nese!""  ""Kneel!"" Doris Burke contributed research."
Interactive Feature,2018-11-30,"Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, has marshaled a team of law enforcement officials to investigate Russia’s 2016 election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired. Here is a look at the core prosecutors.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/30/us/mueller-investigation-team-prosecutors.html,0," BREAUX BRIDGE, La. — Bryson Sassau's application would inspire any college admissions officer.  A founder of T.M. Landry College Preparatory School described him as a ""bright, energetic, compassionate and genuinely well-rounded"" student whose alcoholic father had beaten him and his mother and had denied them money for food and shelter. His transcript ""speaks for itself,"" the founder, Tracey Landry, wrote, but Mr. Sassau should also be lauded for founding a community service program, the Dry House, to help the children of abusive and alcoholic parents. He took four years of honors English, the application said, was a baseball M.V.P. and earned high honors in the ""Mathematics Olympiad."" The narrative earned Mr. Sassau acceptance to St. John's University in New York. There was one problem: None of it was true.  ""I was just a small piece in a whole fathom of lies,"" Mr. Sassau said. T.M. Landry has become a viral Cinderella story, a small school run by Michael Landry, a teacher and former salesman, and his wife, Ms. Landry, a nurse, whose predominantly black, working-class students have escaped the rural South for the nation's most elite colleges. A video of a 16-year-old student opening his Harvard acceptance letter last year has been viewed more than eight million times. Other Landry students went on to Yale, Brown, Princeton, Stanford, Columbia, Dartmouth, Cornell and Wesleyan.  Landry success stories have been splashed in the past two years on the ""Today"" show, ""Ellen"" and the ""CBS This Morning."" Education professionals extol T.M. Landry and its 100 or so kindergarten-through-12th-grade students as an example for other Louisiana schools. Wealthy supporters have pushed the Landrys, who have little educational training, to expand to other cities. Small donors, heartened by the web videos, send in a steady stream of cash. transcript A high school student in front of a laptop, surrounded by classmates, dressed in college gear. A moment of suspense, and then … [Cheers] It was a scene repeated over and over again. Students from one Louisiana private school opening acceptance letters from their dream colleges. The videos often went viral. This one, of a 16-year-old student getting accepted to Harvard, racked up over 8 million views. [Cheers] But there was more to the story. Students told us many of their college applications included false information provided by their school's administrators. And the cheers in these videos covered up an ugly reality of abuse and intimidation at T.M. Landry College Prep. ""Abusing emotionally, physically. We realized, O.K. something's not right. Everything is wrong with T.M. Landry."" Sixteen-year-old Megan Malveaux is a former student. ""There was this little kid, he was probably about 7 or 8, and he was acting up in class. Mr. Mike, he had took the kid by the neck and picked him up and body slammed him on the table."" Mr. Mike is Michael Landry. He and his wife, Tracey, founded the school. It costs up to $725 a month to attend, and received national attention for its 100 percent college acceptance rate. In various TV interviews, they pitched a message of hope and hard work. ""We're changing society. We're giving hope."" ""Go big or go home."" The Landrys denied falsifying transcripts and college applications, and any allegations of abuse. But they do maintain that physical punishments are doled out because they love their students and treat them like family. The Landrys told the story of young black kids from a working-class community, who overcame systemic barriers to achieve success. ""Doesn't matter who you are, doesn't matter where you've been in life, you can do it."" And the videos were crucial in promoting that message. Parents say they had no idea what was going on. ""All the videos, I was excited for all the kids, because they're kids. Little black kids like us can go to Harvard, Yale."" ""I mean, the good talking he did made you realize, well, you're kid needs to go to that school. If you want the best for your kid, you need to send them to T.M. Landry. You know, you speak to anybody in Louisiana, they're telling you."" When the cameras were off, students say they were pitted against each other, interrogated and humiliated. Students say they were also physically punished. Sometimes they would be forced to kneel on rocks, rice or hot concrete, for hours. ""I remember the first time I was put on my knees was because he gave me a test and I failed it."" A New York Times investigation found that behind the scenes, the Landrys filled out transcripts incorrectly to reflect classes the kids say they never took and grades they never earned. ""My transcript was messed up because he messed up my birthday because apparently I was born the year my mom was. He put classes that I never even took, like chemistry."" Students told The Times that the Landrys told them to lie on their college applications about growing up in households marked by poverty, crime and drug addiction. If they refused, they say the Landrys threatened to do it for them. A look back reveals clues about Michael Landry's temperament, like in this recent pitch that became a passionate outburst. [Bangs fist] ""Excuse me, ma'am."" But this was a rare glimpse at his frightening tone. The Landrys produced a steady stream of promotional material, painting a positive picture of an unconventional school. ""T.M. Landry is a no-frills school."" ""No classrooms, no walls, no books."" ""Teachers without certifications. Classes with no teachers at all."" After the acceptance videos started gaining traction in 2016, press from around the country started showing up at their door. ""Walking around campus, we saw that weird Landry style."" Outsiders marveled at how the Landrys could make the impossible happen. ""So, O.K. this is incredible."" ""The results speak for themselves."" ""Go Landrys —"" ""They have figured out the secret sauce —"" ""They really have."" In media interviews, they called themselves a family — ""Family first —"" that pushed kids to their academic limits. ""They will make it. No is not an option. Failure is not an option."" Former students and parents told us that for visits like these, students would be forced to spend days rehearsing what to say to reporters. ""I plan to attend Harvard University."" ""Harvard University."" ""Stanford University."" ""Cornell."" ""Brown."" ""We have this trig book, which is like from M.I.T., so we just basically teach each other."" For the high school students, there was a singular focus: practicing for the ACT. For younger kids: a loose and insufficient curriculum that has left many grade levels behind. When their methods were questioned, the Landrys were quick to dismiss any suspicions. ""Some of them sound a little brainwashed."" ""When it's a black kid and it's strictly education, something's wrong with that kid."" ""The reason why I never said nothing was because I was scared. Because they were getting all of this attentions from news channels. They were in articles. I was so brainwashed and I was thinking, he can't do no wrong. But as you can see since I'm sitting here, I was all wrong."" Now, many in the T.M. Landry community say they feel swindled out of time, money, and ironically, an education. In reality, the school falsified transcripts, made up student accomplishments and mined the worst stereotypes of black America to manufacture up-from-hardship tales that it sold to Ivy League schools hungry for diversity. The Landrys also fostered a culture of fear with physical and emotional abuse, students and teachers said. Students were forced to kneel on rice, rocks and hot pavement, and were choked, yelled at and berated.  The Landrys' deception has tainted nearly everyone the school has touched, including students, parents and college admissions officers convinced of a myth.  The colleges ""want to be able to get behind the black kids going off and succeeding, and going to all of these schools,"" said Raymond Smith Jr., who graduated from T.M. Landry in 2017 and enrolled at N.Y.U. He said that Mr. Landry forced him to exaggerate his father's absence from his life on his N.Y.U. application.  ""It's a good look,"" these colleges ""getting these bright, high-flying, came-from-nothing-turned-into-something students,"" Mr. Smith said. This portrait of T.M. Landry emerged from interviews with 46 people: parents of former Landry students; current and former students; former teachers; and law enforcement agents. The New York Times also examined student records and court documents showing that Mr. Landry and another teacher at the school had pleaded guilty to crimes related to violence against students, and police records that included multiple witness statements saying that Mr. Landry hit children. The Breaux Bridge Police Department closed the case after deciding it was outside of its jurisdiction. ""That dream you see on television, all those videos,"" said Mr. Sassau's mother, Alison St. Julien, ""it's really a nightmare."" In an interview with The Times, the Landrys denied falsifying transcripts and college applications, but Mr. Landry admitted that he hit students and could be rough. ""Oh, I yell a lot,"" he said. He goads black and white students to compete against one another because that is how the real world works, he said.  In 2013, Mr. Landry was sentenced to probation and attended an anger management program after pleading guilty to a count of battery. Despite the documentation, he insisted that he did not plead guilty or serve probation. Mr. Landry said that the victim was a student whose mother asked him to hit her child, and he said he had eased up on physical punishments. ""I don't do that anymore,"" he said. Instead, he calls himself a ""drill sergeant"" or ""coach,"" and asks children to kneel before him to learn humility, for five minutes at most, Mr. Landry said.  That is not how the students have experienced it. Tyler Sassau, Mr. Sassau's brother, said he can still feel the humiliation and smell the stench on his clothes from kneeling last year on a bathroom floor for nearly two hours. ""I wasn't going to get up without asking him because if I did, I could've got something worse,"" he said. ""I could barely stand when I got up."" In their defense, the Landrys touted the school's ACT scores and high graduation and college enrollment statistics. ""We get pushed under the microscope, or under the dagger,"" Mr. Landry said, because ""it had been just black kids going. Society kept saying all these negative things about us because it was just easy to beat this broken-down school."" The students who navigated the Landrys' system and made it to the nation's top colleges now face their own quandaries.  ""I really believe that we all thought we were doing the right thing at the time, and didn't have a choice,"" Mr. Smith said. ""It was a cultish mentality.""  T.M. Landry produced its first graduating class in 2013, and since then, 50 students have graduated, according to the school's promotional materials. They have had mixed success in college. Some alumni, especially those who spent only a short time at T.M. Landry, have been successful. Bryson Sassau did well in his classes at St. John's, although he had to quit some advanced science and math courses. Mr. Smith also did well, but with debts mounting had to drop out after his freshman year. Another Landry graduate said he feels at home at Brown in his junior year, has maintained good grades and was recently accepted into a program that prepares students to pursue a doctoral degree.  The student in the most viral video, who spent only a short time at Landry, is in his first semester at Harvard. Other Landry students have been admitted to Harvard over the past three years, but the university declined to provide information on their status. For yet other Landry students, particularly those who spent multiple years at the school, the results after graduation have been disappointing. Some have withdrawn from college, or transferred to less rigorous programs.  Asja Jackson, whose Wesleyan University acceptance video also went viral, decided to leave this month after she said she fell into a depression over her first-semester struggles. She said she ""froze and failed"" her first chemistry tests and walked out of a biology exam. Her papers, she said, were ""childish,"" and she was too embarrassed to attend a writing workshop.  She studied and worked through the night, like she had done at T.M. Landry since eighth grade, but she just was not ""catching it,"" she said. She said she eventually stopped eating, talking to her friends, leaving her room or going to class.  ""I didn't understand why people around me were doing well, and I wasn't,"" said Ms. Jackson, who took the advice of her dean and started medical leave. ""I couldn't tell my friends because they would say, 'How did you get into the school then?' There were too many questions that I couldn't answer."" At least five T.M. Landry families spoke with local law enforcement, and two more contacted the local education authorities for aid, but little changed.  Ashlee McFarlane, a lawyer at Gerger Khalil & Hennessy in Houston, said dozens of parents, students and staff have left the school and are reaching out to her for help.  ""Above all,"" Ms. McFarlane said, ""they want to protect their children and to finally be heard."" Mr. Landry, 49, and Ms. Landry, 50, say that education lifted them from their impoverished childhoods in Breaux Bridge, near Lafayette. Ms. Landry got a nursing degree. Mr. Landry got his bachelor's degree from the University of Southwestern Louisiana, which was later renamed the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He was a salesman and, from 2002 through 2004, a certified teacher. The couple started T.M. Landry in 2005 as a home-school for their son and five children. The early results were not good. Two of the six students ended up in prison, Mr. Landry said. But the couple continued to recruit students from area churches, telling parishioners that teaching was their calling. T.M. Landry, now an unaccredited private school, settled last year into a bare-bones factory building that Mr. Landry has compared to his students: abandoned and run down, but loved by him. By taking no government funding, the school falls into a narrow category of educational institutions that the state does not regulate or approve, said Erin Bendily, the assistant superintendent of policy and governmental affairs at the Louisiana Department of Education. Some T.M. Landry diplomas say that students meet Louisiana state requirements, but the state does not recognize the diplomas. ""So what, we're not accredited,"" Mr. Landry said at a recruiting event this year. ""Three years in a row, Harvard took us. Stanford has taken us.""  Mr. Landry said he does not participate in state scholarship programs or accept any other funding because it would impair his ability to run the school in a ""nontraditional"" way. Over the years, Mr. Landry has appealed to parents whose children were struggling, bored or ignored in their public and private schools. He told them that his school had special programs for students with disabilities. Parents said he took a deep interest in their lives, called their children ""baby girl"" and ""baby boy,"" and shared personal stories about his own family members who had struggles with drugs or had been in prison. Mr. Landry used to tout the school as created for ""black troublemakers."" As it became more prominent, it started to appeal to local doctors, paralegals and small-business owners. Some white and Asian families also enrolled their children. Black families thought that the Landrys were fighting to give their children a fair shot in a world that often believed they were only capable of being sports stars. Mr. Landry's mantra: ""Why play for a team when you can own the team?"" ""The fact that he was black, I was like, 'Man, he's going to uplift these kids,'"" said Doresa Barton, whose three children were enrolled at Landry until this year.  ""He got us on the unity,"" said Letarchia Lewis, a parent, and he capitalized on ""a disadvantage that you know we are all a part of."" The students cleaned the school, taught younger children, stayed into the night and attended year-round. Nearly every day they would call and respond ""I love you"" in several languages, and Mr. Landry said the word ""kneel"" meant ""I love you"" in his own language, ""Mike-a-nese."" Parents said that they were told to feed and clothe their children — and that Mr. Landry would take care of the rest. Apprehensive families were placated by videos of students solving tough math problems and being accepted to college. ""When you see these videos,"" Ms. Lewis said, ""you want that."" After each viral video and media appearance, donors including wealthy executives and older Americans on fixed incomes sent money. T.M. Landry took in more than $250,000 in donations this year, a portion of which was earmarked by the donors for tuition assistance, according to records of the donations obtained by The Times. But the school has not yet offered any scholarships, said Greg Davis, a T.M. Landry board member. Mr. Landry said donations were put into a general account, but he declined to say how the money was spent. To many T.M. Landry families, tuition is not cheap — about $600 a month, or $7,200 annually. Mr. Landry's annual salary has averaged about $86,000, according to four bankruptcy filings, which he says were driven by all of the tuition that he and his wife have covered. The days start at T.M. Landry with a morning meeting, chants and pep talks, a ritual meant to ""center"" students and help them find their voice and confidence, Mr. Landry said.  The school is based loosely on a Montessori model that emphasizes mastery, so classes are optional, the Landrys said. Younger students described their education as learning from computer programs and YouTube videos. Instructors and textbooks are on hand, but the students teach one another. Math and English lessons are taught by the Landrys, who devote most of their attention to older students preparing for the ACT. Select students take dual-enrollment courses at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette. Adam Broussard, a Landry parent, noticed last fall that his 8-year-old, who had attended the school since he was 3, was writing ""chicken scratch."" Mr. Broussard had been happy with the school — his older son had been admitted to Brown after two years at Landry — but he confronted Mr. Landry about his younger son's progress. Mr. Landry responded that he did not teach sentence structure and just wanted students to love to write. An independent assessment at Sylvan Learning Center revealed that Mr. Broussard's younger son was performing two grade levels behind. ""I gave him my son for six years, almost every day, 12 months of the year,"" Mr. Broussard said of Mr. Landry. ""The longer these kids stayed there, the further behind they were."" News of the Broussard boy's low test scores spread last fall, and at least eight parents interviewed by The Times had their own students assessed. Of their 11 students, only two were performing at grade level, while the rest had fallen behind or made no progress. One junior was performing at a fourth-grade level in reading and math.  Dodie Thomas, a T.M. Landry grandmother, said she discovered that her 6-year-old granddaughter had never learned phonics and that she could not read. She played with Legos most of the day.  ""I feel like I've paid for a high-priced babysitter,"" Ms. Thomas said. Middle and high school students said they mostly completed worksheets that were recycled every few weeks. They came to recognize the failures in the school.  ""It was like building a house on water,"" Tyler Sassau said.  High school students took ACT practice tests day after day and sporadically attended classes. Bryson Sassau, who took the ACT three times, said that once he got to college, he realized an education that revolved around test preparation had ill-served him. ""If it wasn't on the ACT, I didn't know it,"" he said. The Landrys recruited their own family members and parents of students to serve as instructors. They also pulled in staff from other schools by promising them that they would get rich through consulting jobs or owning one of their own T.M. Landry schools one day. Tanika Williams was hired to teach philosophy last year. She took pride in her lessons, but said that because students were not required to attend class, some showed up infrequently. ""I would look at kids literally walking around all day,"" she said. At least a half-dozen staff members resigned. Among those remaining was Keidrick Owens, who had been accused at his previous school of instructing older students to whip younger students with a belt. Last fall, Mr. Owens pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor and was sentenced to 18 months' probation. When Mr. Landry's booming voice would ring through the school — ""I'M GETTING MAD!"" — students scurried to get out of his path. More than a dozen students and staff members told The Times of pupils being humiliated in front of their peers and of racial groups being pitted against one another. Academically weak students were demeaned, and headstrong students were made to kneel. More than a half-dozen students interviewed said they had witnessed Mr. Landry choking their schoolmates, and three students observed him slam others on desks. Another three students said they saw Mr. Landry place a child with autism in a closet. Nyjal Mitchell, 16, said he wanted to be accepted by Mr. Landry because he dreamed of attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He cleaned the school. He stayed later than others. He competed fiercely with his classmates. He said he even ignored attacks on his younger sister, Sanaa, who was bullied. ""I just clicked with the idea of doing something with my life,"" Mr. Mitchell said. ""I had the idea that the only way that would happen was through the school.""  Mr. Mitchell and his parents filed complaints against Mr. Landry in February 2017 with the Breaux Bridge police, detailing what they said were three instances of assault against the young Mr. Mitchell — choking, shoving and dragging. In the family statements to the police, Nyjal Mitchell reported that he also saw Mr. Landry choke three other students, including one with autism. The police conducted an investigation into the alleged assaults, which witnesses said took place from late 2016 to January 2017. The inquiry included witness statements from three students and one teacher.  ""Nyjal attempted to remove Mike's hand due to him turning red,"" one student said, according to the police report.  In another episode cited in the report, Mr. Landry dragged Mr. Mitchell by his hoodie across a concrete floor, put his foot on Mr. Mitchell's throat and made Mr. Mitchell kneel.  Mr. Mitchell said he believed the punishment was a ""normal"" part of being a T.M. Landry student.  ""He had my son broken,"" said his mother, Mary Mitchell. During the investigation, the Breaux Bridge police determined the episodes happened beyond city limits, so the case was referred to the local sheriff, whose office did not comment on its status.  Mr. Landry told students that he would ruin their futures if they left the school or told anyone what happened there, according to 20 current and former students interviewed and Terica Fuselier, a former teacher. They said that Mr. Landry threatened to alter or withhold their transcripts, or force them to enroll in a lower grade. Retaliation was a constant worry for students and teachers, Ms. Fuselier said.  Megan Malveaux, 16, said she believes she received a mediocre transcript from T.M. Landry because she chose to leave the school. An original and a revised document, which had different birth dates, include courses she never took.  Kelvin Simon said that when he found out the school wanted to submit a fraudulent transcript for his daughter's application to Yale, he told Mr. Landry that he would not pay tuition until the school produced a real transcript. Mr. Landry refused, and Mr. Simon withdrew his daughter in October. After Thanksgiving, Mr. Landry tried to bargain with him: In exchange for an accurate transcript, Mr. Simon would pay no tuition but keep his daughter in the school, according to texts reviewed by The Times. Mr. Landry also advised Mr. Simon to state that his income was below $65,000 on financial aid forms to qualify for a scholarship. Mr. Simon's daughter chose to withdraw her application to Yale rather than apply through T.M. Landry, which she no longer trusted.  Mr. Landry also convinced students that he had special relationships with college deans, particularly at Harvard, and that he could use them to help students get into college — or to keep them out. He told students that college officers observed them through the school's security cameras, and that the universities were so involved with the school that they set T.M. Landry's tuition rates.  ""Alleged statements made by Mr. Landry seriously misrepresent his relationship, and that of the T.M. Landry School, with the Harvard College admissions office,"" said Rachael Dane, a Harvard spokeswoman. Dartmouth and Stanford said that they had no role in the operations of T.M. Landry. St. John's, Wesleyan, Cornell and N.Y.U. also said that they had no special relationship with Landry. Claims of observing the school through security cameras were absurd, the colleges said. ""We will look into the issues raised by this reporting,"" said John H. Beckman, a spokesman at N.Y.U. A half-dozen current and former students said that Mr. Landry told them to lie on their college applications. In exchange for students' loyalty, Mr. Landry produced glowing transcripts, including what several students said were high marks in advanced coursework they never took.  ""He was pulling all of the information out of thin air,"" Bryson Sassau said. Only this week did Mr. Sassau see the application that the Landrys submitted to St. John's on his behalf. He was stunned and angry about the fabrications. His father paid child support and had never beat him nor his mother, unlike the abusive parent described.  Bryson Sassau had never started an organization called the Dry House — he had never even heard of it — and had never taken the classes or earned the accolades listed.  A recommendation from his English teacher praising his debate skills twice referred to another student.  ""They didn't even care about me enough to have the decency to change my name,"" Mr. Sassau said.  The Landrys said that they have never falsified information on transcripts or college applications. Instead, Mr. Landry said, he encouraged students to ""go deep"" on their personal statements, and not to hide their struggles. He would edit the statements, he said, or tell them if he did not agree with their approach.  With the exception of federal financial aid forms, each parent interviewed said they never saw their child's college application.  The joy was real. The first recorded Ivy League acceptance appeared to come from Brown in 2013. It was just one student in a cramped room, his classmate filming behind him. It had five comments and two shares. In 2016, the first year T.M. Landry secured several Ivy League acceptances, the videos were of higher quality and included reaction shots from students in Ivy League sweatshirts. ""It became this thing where it was no longer about a family,"" Mr. Sassau said. ""It was more so about publicity."" Students and parents noticed the biggest shift when T.M. Landry moved in early 2017. The school's population grew as the Landrys began recruiting high-performing students from other schools, particularly those with high ACT scores. Visitors and cameras paraded through what had become a Potemkin village. Students and teachers rehearsed in the days before a visitor came, often the same lessons — down to the math problems displayed on the board — that they had run for the last visitor. Students who came to school had to have pristine shoes, fresh hairdos and their scripts ready — name, grade, college aspiration and major. The pressure to paint a positive picture of the school continued even after students left T.M. Landry. When Ms. Jackson reached out to the Landrys to share her struggles at Wesleyan, she said they encouraged her to ""stay on the path."" If not for that advice, she said would have left school earlier.  ""They kept telling me that I had to stick it out, and show my school that T.M. Landry is for real,"" she said.  Some students still cry when they discuss their experiences at T.M. Landry. ""I really should have said something,"" Ms. Malveaux said. ""This isn't what I wanted my life to be or what I want it to be about. I didn't want to be part of the lies, and watching kids be abused and not do anything. I was so brainwashed."" Parents have been consumed with guilt. ""It's a tough pill to swallow,"" Doresa Barton said. ""You always like to think you would never let anything happen to your children."" Ms. Thomas, the grandmother, said she felt like the Landrys preyed on their own community. ""We expect that of other people, but we had an African-American who was one of us and seemed to be doing right by us, and it was a sham,"" she said. After T.M. Landry hit a high of 180 students last year, parents say that enrollment plunged after a July meeting in which Mr. Landry called them a racial slur. Mr. Davis, the board member, blamed the drop on an ""onslaught of negativity.""  Several parents are paying for tutoring or have enrolled their children in home-schools to help them catch up. Mr. Mitchell is among several students who never received a transcript. Last year, he was required to take ninth- and 10th-grade classes at his public high school. This year, he is doing 10th- and 11th-grade coursework. ""To do all that work and still end up behind, it's kind of a slap in the face,"" he said. He still wants to attend M.I.T.  ""I just want people to know what I went through,"" Mr. Mitchell said. Ms. Lewis, a Landry parent of three, said that her son Dawson, who has Asperger's syndrome, left T.M. Landry for another private school this fall, and that he had finally found peers who embraced his quirkiness. Teachers did not make fun of him for having Encopresis, a condition where he soils himself when he is nervous, that had earned him the nickname ""Mr. Smelly Man"" from Mr. Landry. But her son had to leave his new school after about two months because administrators there never received his transcript from the Landrys. ""Their love for my child went as far as my wallet would go for them,"" Ms. Lewis said. ""All there is to prove that they were at T.M. Landry is check stubs."" The Landrys said that they withhold transcripts only when families do not pay their tuition. They declined to address any specific families or situations. This month, the Landrys announced that they would open another school in the town of Opelousas, about 45 minutes from Breaux Bridge. The announcement rattled T.M. Landry families. ""How do you look your son in the face every day and tell him that this person is going to get what's coming to him, or he's going to get his punishment, when every other day you see something else that this person is doing, or they're on to another school, or he's on TV?"" Ms. Mitchell said. The graduates face an uncertain future. Mr. Smith at N.Y.U. and Bryson Sassau at St. John's both plan to take G.E.D. exams as a precaution after hearing that other Landry graduates left their colleges to return to Louisiana — only to find that their high school diplomas were not accepted at local colleges or for internships. Mr. Smith now works in the emergency room at a hospital in Louisiana. He believes he will go back to college, but he worries about other students, particularly his younger brother, who is a student at T.M. Landry. ""I don't want this to keep happening to kids,"" he said. ""I don't want parents to keep putting their kids in this abusive situation."" Mr. Sassau had a severe seizure because of his epilepsy on campus this past spring, and St. John's allowed him to take medical leave. He is set to return in January.  ""I don't know what's going to happen,"" Mr. Sassau said. ""I just want to go to school."" Ms. Jackson said that she hopes to enroll at a college in the South, closer to home. Just before Thanksgiving, The Times went to the school to see if the Landrys would take part in a follow-up interview. The couple agreed, but entered the conference room with about two dozen students who fielded many of the questions. ""Write whatever you want to write about us on the negative side,"" Mr. Landry told a reporter. ""But at the end of the day, my sister, if we got kids at Harvard every day, I'm going to fight for Harvard. Why is it O.K. that Asians get to Harvard? Why is it O.K. that white people get to Harvard?"" Mr. Landry raised his voice. He accused The Times of saying that it was wrong for T.M. Landry to want the best for its black students. He told his students that he would always fight for them. ""We need the haters,"" he said. ""I welcome the haters."" He raised his arms on either side of him, forming a cross. ""My name is Michael Landry. I am the reformer,"" he said. ""They killed Jesus Christ because he could save the world. I say to myself, who are you compared to Jesus? Nothing! So I stick my arms out and say nail me to the cross if that's what you want."" Mr. Landry slipped into the familiar call-and-response with his students. ""In English,"" he commanded them.  ""I love you,"" they said. ""In Mandarin,"" he yelled.  ""Wo ai ni,"" they said. ""In Russian!""  ""Ya lyublyu vas!"" ""In Tagalog!""  ""Mahal kita!"" ""In Mike-a-nese!"" ""Kneel,"" they shouted. ""In Mike-a-nese!""  ""Kneel!"" Doris Burke contributed research."
Op-Ed,2018-12-01,"MEXICO CITY — Amid nervous financial markets, a buildup of thousands of Honduran migrants in Tijuana eager to enter the United States, pressure from the Trump administration on immigration and doubts over the eventual ratification of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement by the United States Congress, Andrés Manuel López Obrador will be inaugurated on Saturday as Mexico’s new president.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/opinion/mexico-lopez-obrador-inauguration-castaneda.html,1033," MEXICO CITY — Amid nervous financial markets, a buildup of thousands of Honduran migrants in Tijuana eager to enter the United States, pressure from the Trump administration on immigration and doubts over the eventual ratification of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement by the United States Congress, Andrés Manuel López Obrador will be inaugurated on Saturday as Mexico's new president. Mr. López Obrador is only the fifth democratically elected president in the country's history, but he received a broad mandate for change last July. He takes office during a troubled era in relations between Mexico and the United States, ushered in two years ago when Donald Trump entered the White House.  The new Mexican leader will have to concentrate on damage control — because Mr. Trump has done a great deal of damage. The danger is that AMLO, as he is widely known, might well aggravate that damage. He is not well equipped for this challenge. Mr. Trump upended more than a quarter century of productive, if tense at times, relations between Mexico and the United States, symbolized by the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, that came into law in 1994. By insisting on negotiating a new trade agreement, now known as the U.S.M.C.A., he introduced a large dose of uncertainty into the trade, investment and logistical cooperation between the two countries.  By threatening to build a wall, and actually deporting large numbers of Mexicans from the heartland of the United States, Mr. Trump needlessly raised tensions on the border. By pressuring Mexico to intercept Central American refugees and dissuading or prohibiting them from requesting asylum in the United States and by radically slowing down asylum-processing at the border, he contributed to the creation of caravans. And by insisting on the war on drugs, he also accentuated Mexico's human rights and security crises, mainly created by the previous two Mexican presidents.  Relations came to such a low point that AMLO's predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto, didn't visit Mr. Trump in the United States or meet with him as president in Mexico. This was the first time in the modern history of bilateral relations.  Mr. López Obrador has to deal with this situation, and doing so will not be simple. He is restricted from the left by his old-style, chip-on-the-shoulder nationalism, his radical base and the perception in Mexico that the outgoing president kowtowed to Washington all too often. He is pressured from the right by politicians concerned with Mexico's weakening economy (a battered peso and a wilting stock exchange), its integration with the United States and the country's vulnerability to any type of Trumpian retaliation for perceived or existing sins. The immigration dilemma will top AMLO's to-do list. It involves Mexicans in the United States, those still leaving Mexico in large, though smaller, numbers and mainly Central Americans, fleeing from violence and poverty in their countries. The Honduran caravan held up at Mexico's northern border is a symptom of this challenge. Mr. López Obrador may accept Washington's demands for Mexico to act as a de facto safe third country, that is, where those seeking asylum in the United States are indefinitely ""parked,"" even if they do not wish to remain in Mexico (and Mexico is anything but a safe country for them). Or else, he faces the threat of border closings or Mr. Trump ripping up the U.S.M.C.A., or both. Next, the new president will have to ensure that current sanctions on Mexican steel and aluminum exports are removed and that the U.S.M.C.A. is something that the United States Congress will actually approve. With a new Democratic majority in the House, this will be a task more arduous than many believe. As happened 25 years ago, when President Bill Clinton had to struggle with his own party to ratify Nafta, this time practically every Democratic vote in the House sought by Mr. Trump will require a Mexican concession, in annexes or side letters, or on separate issues. Then, Mr. López Obrador may decide to go forward with his bold and praiseworthy ideas of legalizing the recreational use of marijuana and poppy cultivation to produce painkillers in Mexico. The country imports legal morphine in large quantities and exports illegal heroin. If he proceeds this way, however, he may face serious reprisals by an American administration concerned about the opioid crisis and drugs in general. Finally, Mr. López Obrador's sympathy for the regimes in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, given the United States' animosity toward them, will add more tensions to the relationship. If AMLO and his team had any experience in handling these matters, or if Mr. Trump showed any inclination to back off on trade, immigration and drugs with Mexico, all of these disagreements could be managed, as they have been in the past. Neither of these two conditions exists today. As long as nothing occurs that threatens Mexican economic stability, this state of affairs is regrettable but tolerable. But if a crisis, like Mexico's economic and financial meltdown in 1994-95, were to arise, neither the American president nor Mr. López Obrador is well suited to confront it. Mr. Trump's constant manipulation of immigration issues for domestic politics and Mr. López Obrador's penchant for impetuous and poorly thought through decisions work against the type of crisis management that both governments produced a quarter of a century ago. Misguided policies like the cancellation of a new Mexico City airport by AMLO via popular referendum; the authoritarian drift seen in the militarization of Mexican public safety and law enforcement; the sending of American troops to the common border by Mr. Trump, and his insistence on building a wall along the border and recklessly imposing trade sanctions all show just how trigger-happy both leaders can be. The Mexican economy has collapsed at least four times over the past 40 years. It can happen to any country. But not all countries can prevent collapse, or fix it. Mr. López Obrador and Mr. Trump are on their own, together and terribly mismatched. Hoping that everything will work out is perfectly understandable, and perfectly naïve. Troubled times, indeed.

News,2018-12-01,WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors cited the involvement of a onetime top fund-raiser to President Trump on Friday in a scheme to launder millions of dollars into the country to help a flamboyant Malaysian financier end a Justice Department investigation.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/us/politics/broidy-trump-foreign-money.html,1177," WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors cited the involvement of a onetime top fund-raiser to President Trump on Friday in a scheme to launder millions of dollars into the country to help a flamboyant Malaysian financier end a Justice Department investigation. Elliott Broidy, a Los Angeles-based businessman who was a finance vice chairman of Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign and inauguration committees, was paid to lobby the Trump administration to try to end an investigation related to the embezzlement of billions of dollars from a Malaysian state-owned fund, according to court filings made public on Friday. The filings were released in connection with a guilty plea entered by George Higginbotham, a former Justice Department employee. Mr. Higginbotham admitted to conspiring to lie to banks about the source of tens of millions of dollars he funneled into the United States from the Malaysian financier Jho Low, who federal authorities say masterminded a scheme to loot the 1 Malaysia Development Berhad fund, also known as 1MDB. Mr. Higginbotham, who left the Justice Department in August, was not involved in the department's investigation of Mr. Low, and is cooperating with prosecutors. In his guilty plea, Mr. Higginbotham admitted that he and the entertainer and businessman Pras Michel, a former member of the Fugees, a defunct hip-hop group, arranged for millions of dollars of Mr. Low's money to be transferred to a law firm owned by Mr. Broidy's wife to pay them to try to end the 1MDB investigation. The charging papers and supporting documents do not identify Mr. Broidy or his wife, Robin Rosenzweig, by name, and neither has been charged with a crime. But the facts of the case align with previous reporting on Mr. Broidy's efforts related to 1MDB, as well as emails from Mr. Broidy that were stolen from Ms. Rosenzweig's account and disseminated to news outlets that match emails cited in Friday's court filings. And people with knowledge of the case said that Mr. Broidy was the person identified in the filings as ""Person 1"" or ""Individual 1,"" who is described as ""a nonlawyer business owner"" who ""owns several businesses, including an investment firm."" In a brief interview on Friday, Mr. Broidy did not deny that the filings refer to him. But he referred specific questions to his lawyer, who did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Broidy, who pleaded guilty in 2009 in an unrelated pension fund bribery case, is one of several Trump associates whose business with foreign governments and figures has attracted scrutiny, including from investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. A veteran Republican fund-raiser who also owns a defense contracting firm, Mr. Broidy had seemed positioned to become a highly influential figure in a political hierarchy that was upended by Mr. Trump's victory. Mr. Broidy had started raising money for Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign at a time when most elite Republican donors were staying away. After Mr. Trump's election, Mr. Broidy marketed his connection to the new administration to politicians, businessmen and governments around the world, including some with unsavory records, and won big contracts for his defense firm. The continuing case of Mr. Low and 1MDB is complex, with federal prosecutors unsealing an indictment against him and an associate in November, and extracting a guilty plea from a former Goldman Sachs banker who was involved in bribes and kickbacks related to 1MDB bond work. Mr. Broidy's involvement, which predates Mr. Low's indictment, underscores both Mr. Low's efforts to navigate the United States judicial system, and the far-flung nature of Mr. Broidy's business pursuits in the early days of the Trump administration. In March 2017, Mr. Low's associates were looking to retain ""someone with political influence,"" according to a Friday filing. Their goal was to help him deflect efforts by American authorities to seize assets bought with money he was accused of siphoning from 1MDB, and to end the Justice Department investigation into his activities, according to the filings. They indicate that, after Mr. Low expressed interest in hiring Mr. Broidy and Ms. Rosenzweig's law firm, Mr. Michel met with Mr. Broidy and an associate ""and explained Jho Low's situation in the 1MDB matters."" Mr. Broidy ""indicated to Michel that although he was willing to assist Jho Low, he would not take any compensation directly from Jho Low in exchange for his services,"" according to the filings. They indicate that Mr. Broidy ""wanted $15 million in compensation, but Michel negotiated the price down to approximately $8 million."" At least $6 million was transferred to Ms. Rosenzweig's law firm through various accounts set up to ""disguise the true source, origin and purpose of the funds, and, specifically, to conceal from U.S. financial institutions Jho Low's ownership, control and affiliation with these funds and transactions,"" according to the filings. A draft agreement called for a $75 million ""success fee"" to be paid to Mr. Broidy if the investigation was resolved within 180 days, or $50 million if it was resolved within 365 days. Mr. Broidy traveled to Thailand in May 2017 to meet with Mr. Low and Mr. Michel, and he indicated ""that he would sit down with Jho Low's legal team and figure out the best way to get to a settlement on the 1MDB matters,"" according to the filings. Mr. Michel indicated that Mr. Broidy ""agreed to try to influence a potential nominee for a federal position that would have authority over the 1MDB forfeiture matters,"" according to the filings, which note that the potential office holder was not nominated. The filings also detail a memo sent in August 2017 by Mr. Broidy's assistant to him outlining talking points intended to ease concerns about the 1MDB scandal that were apparently intended for use by Najib Razak, then the prime minister of Malaysia, during a conversation with Mr. Trump. And the court filings indicate that Mr. Low's allies talked with Mr. Broidy about using his ""political connections to lobby United States government officials"" to force the exit of a Chinese dissident from the United States. Mr. Broidy did not register to lobby for Mr. Razak or Mr. Low, and on Friday, he said that his activities did not constitute lobbying. He has claimed in a lawsuit that he is the victim of a cyberattack by people working for Qatar, who stole his emails in retaliation for his criticism of the country and disseminated them to the news media. Qatar has denied responsibility. Friday's court filings in Mr. Higginbotham's case cite at least one email from Mr. Broidy that was disseminated to the news media. Prosecutors note that Mr. Broidy ""has alleged that at least some of the stolen emails were manipulated and/or fabricated by the hackers."" Mr. Broidy had also drawn unwanted attention because of the criminal investigation of Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, which led to the revelation in April that Mr. Cohen had arranged a $1.6 million hush agreement with a former Playboy model who became pregnant during an affair with Mr. Broidy. That led to Mr. Broidy's resignation as deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee."
Obituary (Obit),2018-12-01,"George Bush, the 41st president of the United States and the father of the 43rd, who steered the nation through a tumultuous period in world affairs but was denied a second term after support for his presidency collapsed under the weight of an economic downturn and his seeming inattention to domestic affairs, died on Friday night at his home in Houston. He was 94.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/us/politics/george-hw-bush-dies.html,10214," George Bush, the 41st president of the United States and the father of the 43rd, who steered the nation through a tumultuous period in world affairs but was denied a second term after support for his presidency collapsed under the weight of an economic downturn and his seeming inattention to domestic affairs, died on Friday night at his home in Houston. He was 94. His death, which was announced by his office, came less than eight months after that of his wife of 73 years, Barbara Bush. Mr. Bush had a form of Parkinson's disease that forced him to use a wheelchair or motorized scooter in recent years, and he had been in and out of hospitals during that time as his health declined. In April, a day after attending Mrs. Bush's funeral, he was treated for an infection that had spread to his blood. In 2013, he was in dire enough shape with bronchitis that former President George W. Bush, his son, solicited ideas for a eulogy. But he proved resilient each time. In 2013 he told well-wishers, through an aide, to ""put the harps back in the closet."" Mr. Bush, a Republican, was a transitional figure in the White House, where he served from 1989 to 1993, capping a career of more than 40 years in public service. A decorated Navy pilot who was shot down in the Pacific in 1944, he was the last of the World War II generation to occupy the Oval Office. Mr. Bush was a skilled bureaucratic and diplomatic player who, as president, helped end four decades of Cold War and the threat of nuclear engagement with a nuanced handling of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the liberation of Eastern Europe. Yet for all his success in the international arena, his presidency faltered as voters seemed to perceive him as detached from their everyday lives. In an election that turned on the economy, they repudiated Mr. Bush in 1992 and chose a relatively little-known Democratic governor from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, a baby boomer, ushering in a generational shift in American leadership. If Mr. Bush's term helped close out one era abroad, it opened another. In January 1991 he assembled a global coalition to eject Iraqi invaders from Kuwait, sending hundreds of thousands of troops in a triumphant military campaign that to many Americans helped purge the ghosts of Vietnam. But the victory also brought years of American preoccupation with Iraq, leading to the decision by George W. Bush in 2003 to topple the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, in a war that taxed American resources and patience. The elder Mr. Bush entered the White House with one of the most impressive résumés of any president. He had been a two-term congressman from Texas, ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican National Committee, United States envoy to China, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and vice president, under Ronald Reagan. And he achieved what no one had since Martin Van Buren in 1836: winning election to the presidency while serving as vice president. (Van Buren did so in the footsteps of Andrew Jackson.) A son of wealth and a graduate of Phillips Academy in Massachusetts and Yale, Mr. Bush was schooled in the good manners and graciousness of New England privilege and civic responsibility. He liked to frame his public service as an answer to the call to duty, like the one that had sent him over the Pacific and into enemy fire as a 20-year-old. (""The cockpit was full of smoke and I was choking from it,"" he told his parents in a letter from the submarine that had plucked him from the sea.) He underscored the theme of duty in accepting his party's nomination for the presidency in 1988 in New Orleans. ""I am a man who sees life in terms of missions — missions defined and missions completed,"" he told Republican delegates in the Louisiana Superdome, acknowledging a swell of applause. He said he would ""keep America moving forward"" and strive ""for a better America.""  22 Photos View Slide Show › ""That is my mission,"" he concluded, ""and I will complete it."" Tall, at 6 feet 2 inches, with an athlete's graceful gait, Mr. Bush was genial and gentlemanly, except in the throes of a tough campaign. (Admonished by his mother against self-promotion, Mr. Bush, an inveterate note writer, in his clipped diction avoided the first person singular pronoun.) He represented a ""kinder"" and ""gentler"" strain of Republicanism — the often-quoted words he used in his Inaugural Address to describe his vision for the nation and the world — that has been all but buried in a seismic shift to the right in the party. Mr. Bush's post-presidency brought talk of a political dynasty. The son of a United States senator, Prescott S. Bush, Mr. Bush saw two of his own sons forge political careers that brought him a measure of redemption after he was ousted as commander in chief. George W. Bush became the first son of a president since John Quincy Adams to follow his father to the White House. (Unlike the father, the son won re-election.) Another son, Jeb Bush, was twice elected governor of Florida and ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 2016. As the elder Mr. Bush watched troubles envelop the eight-year presidency of his son, however, what had been a source of pride became a cause of distress, friends said. The contrast between the two President Bushes — 41 and 43, as they came to call each other — served to burnish the father's reputation in later years. As the younger Mr. Bush's popularity fell, the elder Mr. Bush's public standing rose. Many Americans came to appreciate the restrained, seasoned leadership the 41st president had displayed; in an opinion poll in 2012, 59 percent expressed approval. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, praised the father as a way of rebuking the son. It was a subject Mr. Bush avoided discussing in public but one he finally addressed in conversations with Jon Meacham, his biographer, in a book published in 2015. Mr. Bush was quoted as saying that his son's administration had been harmed by a ""hard line"" atmosphere that pushed an aggressive and ultimately self-destructive use of force around the world, and he placed the blame for that on men who had long been part of his own life and who became key figures in his son's orbit — Dick Cheney, his son's vice president, and Donald H. Rumsfeld, his son's secretary of defense, with whom the elder Mr. Bush had feuded. ""I do worry about some of the rhetoric that was out there — some of it his, maybe, and some of it the people around him,"" Mr. Bush said in the Meacham book, ""Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush."" He was particularly critical of Mr. Rumsfeld. ""I don't like what he did, and I think it hurt the president, having his iron-ass view of everything,"" he said, adding, ""Rumsfeld was an arrogant fellow and self-assured, swagger."" Mr. Bush and his sons did not attend the Republican National Convention that nominated Donald J. Trump as its presidential candidate in 2016, and he pointedly did not endorse Mr. Trump in his race against Hillary Clinton. During the primary, Mr. Trump had repeatedly belittled Jeb Bush as ""low energy."" Mr. Bush, who had entered the contest as the son of a president with an inside track for the nomination, was forced to withdraw by February. After his loss in 1992 to Mr. Clinton, in an election in which the billionaire independent candidate Ross Perot won almost a fifth of the vote, Mr. and Mrs. Bush repaired to their home in Houston and to their oceanfront compound in Kennebunkport, Me. By his own account the loss had left him dispirited and feeling humiliated. But he did not quite retire. He celebrated several milestone birthdays, including his 90th, with parachute jumps. He traveled the globe on White House missions, joining Mr. Clinton to raise funds for the victims of the tsunami that ravaged Asia in 2004 and of Hurricane Katrina the next year. Until these undertakings, Mr. Bush had made little effort to mask his disdain for Mr. Clinton, but they forged an unlikely, almost familial, bond, growing so close that Mrs. Bush described her husband as the father Mr. Clinton never had. The two former presidents became a symbol of bipartisanship in an increasingly partisan age. If Mr. Bush's embrace helped scrub Mr. Clinton's reputation of some of its tawdrier aspects, Mr. Clinton helped transform Mr. Bush's image from that of a vanquished one-term president who had never fully escaped the shadow of his popular predecessor, Reagan, to one of a respected elder statesman. Mr. Bush was president during a shift in the world order that had begun under Reagan. His measured response to upheaval in Eastern Europe drew complaints that he was not seizing the reins of history. But he chose a collaborative approach, working with the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to allow for the reunification of Germany, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The two leaders signed treaties mandating historic reductions in their countries' nuclear and chemical weapons. ""George H. W. Bush was the best one-term president the country has ever had, and one of the most underrated presidents of all time,"" James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state and Mr. Bush's closest adviser for nearly 50 years, said in an interview in 2013. ""I think history is going to treat him very well."" In his first year at the White House, Mr. Bush sent troops into Panama to oust its strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The rapid, relatively bloodless conclusion of the Persian Gulf war of 1991 earned him a three-minute standing ovation and shouts of ""Bush! Bush!"" when he addressed a joint session of Congress that March. It also sent his voter approval ratings soaring to close to 85 percent during the four-day aerial bombardment of Baghdad, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. It was the pinnacle of his presidency, yet it lulled him, not to mention some potentially formidable Democrats, into assuming his re-election was certain. Iraq was not an unalloyed victory. Mr. Bush felt compelled to defend his decision to suspend the assault before it could topple Mr. Hussein, and his critics questioned his earlier effort to give Mr. Hussein financial aid and intelligence data. Still, foreign policy successes were the hallmark of his presidency. Not so his domestic record. By the midpoint of his term, leaders of both the Republican and Democratic Parties complained that in the midst of the worst economy any American president had faced since the end of World War II, Mr. Bush had no domestic agenda. Many questioned his sensitivity to the worries of ordinary Americans. Though stung by the criticism, he did little to dispel that perception on a visit to an economically reeling New Hampshire during his re-election campaign, when he announced in January, ""Message: I care."" His signal domestic decision was almost certainly the 1990 budget deal, which sought to address deepening deficits by raising taxes on the wealthy. If it helped put the nation back on solid financial footing, it nevertheless reversed one of the most explicit campaign pledges ever uttered by a major-party presidential candidate: ""Read my lips. No new taxes."" That promise had been delivered to roars of approval in his acceptance speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention in New Orleans, and the turnabout provoked a chorus of reproach. Conservative Republicans revolted. Democrats found an opening for a bruising attack. And the stage was set for an unexpectedly strong third-party challenge by Mr. Perot, a fellow Texan who had made his fortune in computers. ""It did destroy me,"" Mr. Bush told Mr. Meacham years later as he assessed the damage he had suffered from breaking his 1988 campaign pledge. Barely a year after the world had hailed his success in Iraq, Mr. Bush found himself almost losing the Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire to the conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan. Mr. Bush won the nomination but was weakened by the Buchanan challenge and accordingly veered sharply to the right. He then lost to Mr. Clinton. Mr. Perot's 19 percent of the popular vote helped deny both Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton a majority. By any yardstick, Mr. Bush was an aristocrat, a product of moneyed Greenwich, Conn., where he was instilled with an enduring sense of noblesse oblige. As a candidate, he was known to ask his Secret Service detail to stop at traffic lights. He wrote enough thank-you notes, courtesy cards and letters of sympathy — Mr. Bush seemed to know someone in every town in America — to fill a book, literally. That book's title was his customary signoff, ""All the Best, George Bush."" Published in 1999, it appeared in lieu of a traditional presidential memoir, which he thought would be unseemly for a man whose mother, Dorothy W. Bush, had taught him the importance of modesty. But the patrician image also hurt him politically. He drew barbs for his drawing-room mannerisms and expressions. When a waitress serving coffee at a New Hampshire truck stop during the 1988 presidential campaign asked him if he would like a refill, he nodded, saying yes, he'd have another ""splash."" His critics saw him as out of touch with ordinary Americans, pointing to what they portrayed as his amazed reaction during a demonstration of a supermarket scanner when he visited a grocers' convention while president. (He later insisted that he had not been surprised.) In a debate during the 1992 campaign, Mr. Bush became flustered when a woman asked him how he could respond to the economic distress ""of the common people"" if he had ""no experience with what's ailing them."" Mr. Bush gazed uneasily at his questioner. ""Help me with the question, and I'll try to answer it,"" the president said. Moments afterward, he watched as Mr. Clinton strode eagerly across the stage to engage the woman and, some said, win over much of the electorate. Aware of his boarding-school image, Mr. Bush liked to point to his earthier chapters: his years in the Texas oil business, his wartime service. He reminded listeners that he did not wear button-down dress shirts or striped ties, thank you very much, and that he liked country music, horseshoes and pork rinds. His courteousness was often taken — mistaken might be the better word — for docility. In 1987, Newsweek put his picture on the cover with the headline ""Fighting the 'Wimp Factor.' "" (""The cheapest shot I've seen in my political life,"" Mr. Bush fumed in his diary.) But he could be fiercely competitive in both politics and play. He ran a harsh campaign to beat Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts in 1988. He did not simply play golf, he played what the White House physician called ""aerobic golf,"" a mad rush from green to green. Mr. Bush was given to malapropisms, a trait he may have handed down to his son George. He tangled his sentences, particularly when he was nervous. And he supplied a stream of entries into the American political lexicon. He talked about the ""Big Mo"" to describe the momentum that a victory in the Iowa caucuses had given his campaign. Tough moments were ""tension city."" In asking voters not to pity him, he plucked a line from the musical ""Evita,"" saying, ""Don't cry for me, Argentina."" His speeches were delivered with a nasal voice and his signature clipped cadence that invited parody. The comedian Dana Carvey made his Bush imitation a staple of ""Saturday Night Live."" (""Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent."") Rarely did Mr. Bush display the kind of emotional acuity that could move an audience. In a debate in 1992, a television camera captured him glancing at his wristwatch, as if he were bored. Yet for all these moments, Mr. Bush could exhibit a gracious charm and authenticity. He was that rare figure in Washington: a man without enemies — or with very few, at any rate. ""You don't see anybody trashing this president,"" Mr. Baker said in the 2013 interview. ""Whether they agreed with him on certain policy positions or not, people respected him and liked him."" Besides his sons George and Jeb, Mr. Bush is survived by two other sons, Neil and Marvin; his daughter, Dorothy Bush Koch; a brother, Jonathan; a sister, Nancy Walker Bush Ellis; 17 grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Robin, died of leukemia at age 3 in 1953. His older brother, Prescott S. Bush Jr., died in 2010 at 87, and his younger brother, William, died in March  at 79. Mr. Bush remained physically and mentally robust well into his later years, pursuing a retirement seemingly as active as his career had been. At Kennebunkport, when not golfing, he could be found piloting his speedboat, grinning as it roared atop the waves while often terrifying passengers who had dared to join him. The day before he turned 80, in 2004, he gave a eulogy at Reagan's funeral in California. Back in Texas two days later, he celebrated his birthday with about 5,000 invited guests, including Mr. Gorbachev, at a gala dinner in Houston's baseball stadium. The day after that, as 3,000 people watched from below, Mr. Bush strapped on a parachute and jumped out of a plane. George Herbert Walker Bush — he was named after his mother's father, George Herbert Walker — was born on June 12, 1924, the second of five children, in Milton, Mass., outside Boston. His family moved to Greenwich soon after. His father, besides his two terms in the United States Senate, was a banker who commuted to Wall Street as a managing partner at Brown Brothers Harriman, the white-shoe investment firm. His mother, the former Dorothy Walker, was a native of Maine. It was she who gave George his nickname, Poppy, when he was a toddler. The children grew up sheltered from the Depression, tended to by maids and a driver. George enrolled at Greenwich Country Day School and Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. They spent summers in Kennebunkport. Mr. Bush's high school yearbook testifies to his ambitions and energy: He was president of the senior class, chairman of the student deacons and captain of both the baseball team and the soccer team. If his father set the tone for Mr. Bush's career, his mother shaped his values. His daughter, Ms. Koch, wrote in a memoir that he had been admonished to eschew self-promotion. "" 'Nobody likes the big I am, George,' my grandmother would say to him,"" Ms. Koch wrote. "" 'Don't be talking about yourself.' "" Mr. Bush once boasted to his mother that he had scored three goals in a soccer match. ""That's nice, George,"" his mother replied, ""but how did the team do?"" Six months before he graduated from Phillips Academy, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. ""I could hardly wait to get out of school and enlist,"" he wrote years later. At 18, a handsome and strapping young man, Mr. Bush did enlist, as a seaman second class in the Navy's flight training program. Soon he was flying combat missions in the Pacific. In September 1944, on a bombing run from the aircraft carrier San Jacinto, his plane was hit near the island of Chichi Jima by antiaircraft guns. He looked out and saw the wings on fire. ""I headed the plane out to sea and put on the throttle so as we could get away from the land as much as possible,"" he told his parents in a letter. ""I turned the plane up in an attitude so as to take the pressure off the back hatch so the boys could get out. After that I straightened up and started to get out myself."" Two men on the plane died in the attack. Mr. Bush hit his head bailing out, he said, but landed safely in the ocean. He floated on a raft for hours, ""violently sick to my stomach,"" until a submarine rescued him. He was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross. He returned home on Christmas Eve 1944. Days later, he married a young woman he had met at a dance three years earlier: Barbara Pierce, the daughter of Marvin Pierce, the publisher of Redbook and McCall's magazines. Discharged from the Navy as a lieutenant junior grade, Mr. Bush enrolled at Yale, where he was admitted to the exclusive Skull and Bones club. With the arrival of the couple's first child, their apartment in New Haven became the home of two future presidents. After graduating from Yale in 1948 with a degree in economics, Mr. Bush took his red 1947 Studebaker — a graduation present from his parents — and drove to Odessa, Tex. A wealthy family friend, Henry Neil Mallon, gave him an entry-level job at his Texas oil company, Dresser Industries, landing him in a state that he barely knew but that would become a part of his political identity. But Mr. Bush grew bored in the job, and in 1951 he and a Texas entrepreneur formed an oil exploration business. Two years later, with the business struggling, they merged with another company to form Zapata Petroleum. Zapata had a reputation for never drilling a dry hole, and before long Mr. Bush had made his first million. By 1963 he was living in Houston, and his thoughts turned to politics. There was a contest to lead the Harris County Republican committee, and, by his account, local Republicans pressed him to jump in to prevent the far-right John Birch Society from taking over. Night after night Mr. Bush drove across the county to make speeches, with Mrs. Bush typically sitting behind him onstage, crocheting. He won, and the victory caught the attention of state Republican leaders, who urged him to challenge Senator Ralph Yarborough, a Democrat seeking a second term in 1964. Mr. Bush agreed. It was not the easiest way to begin a career in elective politics. Mr. Yarborough had ridden in President John F. Kennedy's motorcade at the time of the assassination in Dallas the previous year, and the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, a fellow Texan who was heading for a landslide election victory, supported him. Mr. Yarborough tried to discredit Mr. Bush by tying him to Barry M. Goldwater, the conservative Arizona senator and overmatched Republican presidential candidate. Mr. Bush did not resist the association. He criticized the Civil Rights Act that was before Congress, denounced the 1963 nuclear test ban treaty and warned of a welfare state. He lost, but his 43 percent of the vote was hardly embarrassing in a still decidedly Democratic state. In February 1966, Mr. Bush resigned as chairman and chief executive of Zapata to run for Congress in a wealthy Houston district. Surveying his electorate, he began moving to the center; he now spoke well of the Johnson agenda, declaring in a speech, ""I generally favor the goals as outlined in the Great Society."" He told his minister: ""I took some of the far-right positions to get elected. I hope I never do it again. I regret it."" Mr. Bush won the House seat handily, with 67 percent of the vote. In Washington, he was one of 47 Republican freshmen in a Democratic-controlled Congress. In his telling, his most consequential vote there was for the open housing bill of 1968, an extension of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which he had campaigned against. He still had concerns about the act's constitutionality, he wrote about his evolution, but the ""problem of discrimination troubled me deeply."" Mr. Bush was re-elected without opposition in 1968. The next spring, President Richard M. Nixon encouraged him to challenge Mr. Yarborough again for a Senate seat, although it would mean giving up a safe House seat and a post on the Ways and Means Committee. With Mr. Yarborough appearing more vulnerable this time, Mr. Bush took the challenge for the 1970 election. Once again things did not turn out as planned. Representative Lloyd Bentsen challenged Mr. Yarborough in the Democratic primary and, in an upset, won. Mr. Bush, suddenly confronting a much tougher opponent, lost by more than 150,000 votes. Twice defeated as a Senate candidate, and with his term in the House about to expire, Mr. Bush was looking for work. He was shortly summoned to the White House, where H. R. Haldeman, Nixon's chief of staff, talked to him about a White House staff job. Mr. Bush, however, wanted to be the United States ambassador to the United Nations. Nixon agreed. His nomination drew a tide of criticism — his qualifications, as a former two-term congressman, were not immediately apparent — but Mr. Bush won confirmation in February 1971. His United Nations service began with an embittering defeat in a vote on whether to seat a delegation from China. The United States had wanted both Taiwan and the People's Republic of China to be represented, but the United Nations General Assembly voted to expel Taiwan to make way for China. Delegates danced in the aisles, delighted to see the United States humiliated. When Mr. Bush rose to speak, he was hissed. ""Gladiatorial ugliness at its worst,"" he later called it. In 1972, after the break-ins at the Democratic Party offices at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, Nixon had a more urgent need for Mr. Bush: to lead the Republican National Committee. He took the job, he wrote, certain of Nixon's innocence in the scandal, and he defended Nixon, though it was not easy. Meeting with editors and reporters of The Washington Post at the newspaper's offices, he talked about the pressures he felt even from within his own party. ""I had two stacks of mail,"" he said. The first asked, ""How come you're not doing more to support the president?"" The second asked, ""How come you're keeping the party so close to the president?"" But as the scandal deepened, his support for Nixon began to erode, particularly after the Supreme Court ordered the president to turn over 64 tapes, including one that recorded him ordering Mr. Haldeman to block an F.B.I. inquiry into the break-ins. ""This was proof the president had lied,"" Mr. Bush wrote in ""All the Best, George Bush."" ""The man is amoral,"" he said of Nixon in his diary. After Nixon resigned, ceding the presidency to Vice President Gerald R. Ford, Mr. Bush hoped to fill the vice president's office. Ford called him in Kennebunkport two weeks later to tell him that he had chosen former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York for the job. Mr. Bush went instead to China, as head of the United States Liaison Office, serving as an unofficial ambassador at a time when the two countries did not have full diplomatic relations. He would describe the period as a sabbatical, free of stress and obligations. Ford brought him back for another assignment in 1976: to lead the C.I.A., which was still reeling from accusations that it had abused its power under Nixon, including plotting to assassinate foreign leaders and overturn governments. Mr. Bush was credited with restoring morale at the agency, but it was another short-lived appointment, lasting just under a year. Ford lost the election to Jimmy Carter that November, and Mr. Bush returned to Texas. There he turned his sights toward running for president. ""I am determined to make an all-out effort for 1980,"" he wrote to Nixon in January 1979. Mr. Bush put together a cabinet of advisers — including Mr. Baker, a Houston lawyer who had managed his 1970 Senate campaign and Ford's 1976 presidential campaign — and began traveling the country. He focused first on the Iowa caucuses, borrowing from Jimmy Carter's strategy in 1976 of using a victory there to jump ahead of the field. He succeeded in Iowa, but then lost in New Hampshire, and by May the party was coalescing around Reagan. Mr. Bush met with his advisers. ""A consensus was reached — the campaign had no future,"" he wrote in his autobiography. ""There was only one dissenting voice. Mine."" Mr. Bush decided on a new goal: to become vice president. But that July he learned from television that Reagan was seeking to enlist Ford. To ask a former president to take the No. 2 spot was a surprising move, but Reagan, a former actor and California governor with hard-right views, hoped that Ford would bring to the ticket both Washington heft and political moderation. Their negotiation faltered, however, and Mr. Bush received the telephone call he had wanted. ""Hello, George,"" Reagan said to Mr. Bush. ""This is Ron Reagan. I'd like to go over to the convention and announce that you're my choice for vice president, if that's all right with you."" That November, the Reagan-Bush ticket won in a landslide and Mr. Bush offered the new president his fealty. ""I will never do anything to embarrass you politically,"" he wrote to Reagan. Mr. Bush happily accepted his first assignment: leading a task force to reduce federal regulations. He rarely, if ever, said no to attending the funeral of a foreign dignitary, and he endured the ribbing that is the cost of being a vice president. ""Let 'em laugh,"" Mr. Bush said. ""There's a lot going on, and it's substantive, and I like it."" The Reagan-Bush team was even more convincing in the 1984 re-election campaign, when the Democratic challenger, former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, chose as his running mate Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, the first woman nominated for national office by a major party. She and Mr. Bush sparred throughout the campaign, and he came in for criticism when he was overheard after a debate bragging that ""we tried to kick a little ass last night."" But almost as soon as the votes began piling up, he turned to his own political future. Early in 1986, wanting to shore up his shaky credentials on the right, Mr. Bush gave a series of speeches in which he backed constitutional amendments supporting a balanced budget and school prayer and restricting abortion. He also tied himself ever more tightly to Reagan by presenting himself as the rightful heir to his party's presidential nomination. But the risks in that strategy became all too apparent. With the exposure of the Iran-contra affair — the clandestine scheme to sell arms to Iran in exchange for the release of Iranian hostages and then to divert the proceeds to right-wing Nicaraguan rebels — the White House came under investigation, and Mr. Bush was hounded by questions about what he knew about the deal. He said he had expressed ""certain reservations"" about it in White House meetings, a recollection that at one point Reagan seemed to challenge. The arms-for-hostages storm hurt Mr. Bush and emboldened his Republican opponents. In January 1988, when Mr. Bush faced an unexpectedly tough challenge in Iowa from Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, an interview with the CBS News anchor Dan Rather turned into a 10-minute confrontation. Mr. Rather pressed Mr. Bush about his role in the Iran-contra affair. ""I want to talk about why I want to be president,"" Mr. Bush said. ""I don't think it's fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran."" Mr. Bush came in third in the Iowa caucuses, behind Mr. Dole and the evangelical preacher Pat Robertson. It was an embarrassment for a vice president in office and the presumed heir to the nomination. Stung, Mr. Bush turned his hopes to New Hampshire, where his campaign was being run by Gov. John H. Sununu. Mr. Sununu advised him to counter his image as a man of privilege. Soon the president was campaigning in a windbreaker, pumping hands at factory gates and, at one point, leaping from his motorcade to help a driver stuck in a snowbank. Mr. Bush won the New Hampshire primary with 37.8 percent of the vote, and Mr. Dole ended his dwindling chances that night when he flashed anger in a television interview. When the NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw asked Mr. Dole if he had anything to say to Mr. Bush, he responded by saying, ""Stop lying about my record."" By the spring, Mr. Bush had pivoted toward the Democratic field, where Mr. Dukakis had emerged as the party's choice. The Bush camp decided to portray Mr. Dukakis as a Massachusetts liberal, highlighting his membership in the American Civil Liberties Union and his having supported a program that provided a weekend furlough to a prisoner, Willie Horton, who had raped a woman while free from jail one weekend. When Mr. Bush arrived in New Orleans for the Republican convention, Mr. Dukakis had a 17-point lead in opinion polls. Mr. Bush did not get off to the most auspicious start. Even some Republicans questioned his choice for running mate: Dan Quayle, a young, boyish-looking, little-known Indiana senator who was just finishing his first term. But Mr. Bush was focused on his opponent. He mocked Mr. Dukakis for being a ""card-carrying member of the A.C.L.U."" and attacked him for refusing to sign a Massachusetts bill mandating that teachers lead students in a daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. Bush pulled ahead of Mr. Dukakis in the polls. As Election Day neared, Mr. Dukakis faded under the pummeling of a campaign that even some Republicans would characterize as ugly. Lee Atwater, who had directed the campaign, apologized in 1991 for the tactics he had employed. The day before the election, Mr. Bush was confident enough about the outcome that he decided to name Mr. Baker, his campaign manager in 1970 and 1980, as secretary of state and Mr. Sununu, who had saved his candidacy in New Hampshire, as chief of staff. His victory, on Nov. 8, was convincing: He won 40 states and 54 percent of the popular vote, to Mr. Dukakis's 46 percent. The next day, seeking to distance himself from harsher sides of his campaign, Mr. Bush assured reporters that they would never again see the candidate some had begun calling George the Ripper. Denied the presidency earlier and overshadowed by Reagan for eight years, Mr. Bush was triumphant as he stood at the West Front of the Capitol on Inauguration Day in January 1989, a throng of well-wishers spread out below. He was 64 years old and eager to move into the office down the hall and around the corner from the quarters he had occupied as vice president — so eager that he exclaimed ""I"" before Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist had finished asking him if he would solemnly swear to faithfully execute the office of president. In his Inaugural Address, Mr. Bush pledged ""to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world."" He talked about a ""thousand points of light,"" a reference to community and charitable groups, ""spread like stars throughout the nation."" But he soon met obstacles to that lofty ambition — some political, some economic, some of his own doing and some beyond his control. The most immediate difficulty came from operating in Reagan's shadow. Mr. Bush had replaced, and would be judged against, a two-term president who had come to embody a new era of Republicanism while presiding over what was, at the time, the longest period of economic growth in history. If things went wrong for Mr. Bush, he would not be able to blame his predecessor. And clearly he did not approve of everything Reagan had done as president. The heavy budget deficit Reagan had left promised to complicate anything the new president might want to do. Mr. Bush also faced a solidly Democratic Congress, a disadvantage he would later blame for his limited legislative record. And although Mr. Bush had defeated Mr. Dukakis soundly, he was not feared; Democrats were not inclined to afford him much of a ride. Mr. Bush's first test came with his nomination of an old ally, John G. Tower, as secretary of defense. Mr. Tower, a former senator from Texas, had served on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Mr. Bush thought the nomination would, as he wrote, ""glide through the Hill for two good reasons: He was more than qualified for the job, and Congress is usually kind to its own. ""I could not have been more wrong."" The problems rose from the right. Paul M. Weyrich, an uncompromising leader of the conservative movement, testified before the committee that he had seen Mr. Tower inebriated in public and in the company of women other than his wife. Mr. Weyrich said he had ""serious reservations"" about Mr. Tower's ""moral character."" The next day, Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who was chairman of the committee, asked Mr. Tower if he had a drinking problem. ""I have none, senator,"" Mr. Tower said. But the nomination was sliding off the tracks, and Mr. Bush responded with fury, denouncing what he called the ""frenzied air of speculation"" about Mr. Tower. He and Mr. Quayle began lobbying senators personally. The Senate voted 53 to 47 to reject Mr. Tower's nomination. It was the first time in 30 years that a president had been denied his choice of a cabinet member. Mr. Bush next nominated a popular House member for the defense secretary job: Mr. Cheney of Wyoming. But the Tower episode had taken a toll. The 41st president had not reached the benchmark first 100 days in office, yet he felt compelled to declare that his White House was ""on track."" ""I would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to be bubbling around, that nothing is happening,"" he said. ""A lot is happening, not all of it good, but a lot is happening."" In the spring, the Bush presidency turned to foreign affairs, where it stayed for much of the next two years. In Panama, Mr. Noriega claimed victory in an election in May that independent observers said had been stained with fraud. Mr. Bush declared the election stolen and called for international pressure to make the Panamanian strongman step aside. It would take almost eight months to accomplish that goal. The Soviet bloc was in even greater upheaval. Mr. Gorbachev, who had come to power in 1985, had begun a campaign for economic and democratic change, shaking the foundations of communism across Eastern Europe. Mr. Bush found himself under pressure to respond with equal boldness. In April 1989, he went to a Polish enclave in Michigan to salute the Polish government for its political liberalization, including providing for the labor union Solidarity to regain its legal status. ""The winds of change are shaping a new European destiny,"" Mr. Bush said. It was time, he declared in Texas a few weeks later, to ""seek the integration of the Soviet Union into the community of nations."" And at a NATO meeting in May in Brussels, where many world leaders wanted to see if he could hold his own, he presented Mr. Gorbachev with a proposal for conventional arms cuts. Still, Mr. Bush was criticized, even by allies, for having responded tentatively and tepidly to developments behind the Iron Curtain. After the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, reporters asked Mr. Bush why he seemed subdued. ""I'm just not an emotional kind of guy,"" he replied. He bristled at the criticism. ""If we mishandle this,"" he said, speaking of the rebellions in Eastern Europe, ""and get way out looking like an American project, you could invite crackdown and invite negative reaction that could result in bloodshed."" Mr. Bush had been similarly cautious in June that year, when Chinese troops cracked down on students demonstrating around Tiananmen Square in Beijing and opened fire, killing hundreds. He announced sanctions against China but said he did not want to cut off diplomatic relations. That fall, Mr. Bush announced that he and Mr. Gorbachev would meet, albeit with no formal agenda, on vessels off the coast of Malta, in the Mediterranean. The summit meeting took place in early December 1989. Rough waters forced the cancellation of a negotiating session, but when the seas abated, the two leaders met and vowed to conclude treaties on long-range nuclear weapons and conventional arms by the end of the next year. They agreed, Mr. Gorbachev said, that ""the characteristics of the Cold War should be abandoned."" At the time, Mr. Bush was frustrated by Mr. Noriega's resilience. In October, dissident Panamanian defense forces had been crushed in an attempted coup that received some, but not enough, American support. Mr. Noriega appeared before cameras in a taunting show of defiance. On Dec. 20, the United States invaded Panama in a swift overnight operation involving 11,000 troops; 23 Americans died. Mr. Noriega fled, eventually turning up at the residence of the Vatican's representative in Panama City before surrendering to the United States to face narcotics-trafficking charges. Mr. Atwater, the chairman of the Republican National Committee at the time, said the capture was a ""political jackpot"" for Mr. Bush. Through all of this, Mr. Bush, trying to establish a presidential identity distinct from Reagan's, was moving away from his predecessor's policies. He slowed spending on the missile defense shield and the Strategic Defense Initiative (known as Star Wars), and delayed production of the Stealth bomber. He proposed a tougher Clean Air Act to curb major sources of hazardous air pollution, including emissions from coal-burning power plants. And he agreed to send humanitarian aid, but not military aid, to the Nicaraguan contras, the rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government. Mr. Bush also negotiated and signed the landmark Americans With Disabilities Act, largely fulfilling a 1988 campaign pledge. Nearly 3,000 people, many in wheelchairs, attended the White House signing. ""Let the shameful walls of exclusion finally come tumbling down,"" he said. Supporters of the bill called it the most significant piece of civil rights legislation in two decades. It barred discrimination against people with handicaps in places of public accommodation, transportation and employment, and mandated that many new public and private buildings be made easily accessible to people with disabilities. Similar rules applied to buses and trains. Environmental groups praised Mr. Bush's record on climate change and the environment. As president, he signed the United States to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, which led to the Paris Agreement on a plan to reduce global emissions. Mr. Bush also created the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the federal body that produces a sweeping government climate change report every four years. Mr. Bush's popularity and spirits were soaring when he stepped before Congress for his first State of the Union address, in January 1990. He used the speech to hail what he called the ""revolution of '89,"" with ""changes so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in the world's affairs."" In the spring, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev concluded a summit meeting in Washington with broad agreements to commit to reduce arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons and to eliminate most of their chemical weapons. On the domestic front, Mr. Bush was ready to negotiate a deal on the growing budget deficit. But in doing so he opened the door to what he would come to see as the worst mistake of his presidency. ""We need a deal,"" he wrote in his diary. ""I'm willing to eat crow, but the others are going to have to eat crow. I'll have to yield on 'Read My Lips,' and they're going to have to yield on some of their rhetoric on taxes and on entitlements."" Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary at the time, said the administration had ""no preconditions"" as it entered negotiations with congressional leaders. But Democrats, seeking to guard against Republican attacks in elections that fall, said they would not consider any tax increases unless Mr. Bush publicly endorsed such a step. The White House issued a statement by the president on June 26. ""It is clear to me,"" it said, ""that both the size of the deficit problem and the need for a package that can be enacted require all of the following."" There was a short list of actions. One was ""tax revenue increases."" Mr. Bush and congressional Democrats agreed on a budget proposal that included raising taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, liquor and luxury items. The reaction was scathing. ""The president gave away the crown jewel of his campaign promise to bring the Democrats to the table: That was 'no new taxes,' "" said Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California. The House voted down the budget proposal, 254 to 179, in October 1990. It took several weeks to reach a final deal, which included raising the tax rate on upper income earners to 31 percent from 28 percent. Mr. Bush said that he would sign it, but that he was ""absolutely going to hold the line on taxes from now on."" In the early hours of Aug. 2, 1990, Iraqi forces under the command of Saddam Hussein rumbled into Kuwait and seized its oil fields. ""This is radical Saddam Hussein moving,"" Mr. Bush wrote in his diary as he sat in the Oval Office at 6 a.m. In an address to the nation a few days later, Mr. Bush signaled that the United States was prepared to respond with force. ""This will not stand,"" he said. Over the next two weeks, Mr. Bush moved the nation toward war while trying to reassure leaders like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who told him, ""Don't go wobbly on me, George."" He sent paratroopers to Saudi Arabia and ordered warships to the Persian Gulf to enforce United Nations trade sanctions against Iraq. From the start, Mr. Bush was dubious that Mr. Hussein would respond to diplomacy. But while Mrs. Thatcher was trying to steel him, other European allies, as well as Mr. Gorbachev and Democrats in Congress, were pressuring him not to act too aggressively. Mr. Bush pressed his case, saying publicly that he wanted to avoid a military solution, while preparing for just that. ""Vital issues of principle are at stake,"" he declared to Congress on Sept. 11. ""Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face of the earth."" In November, Mr. Bush nearly doubled the size of the United States presence in the Persian Gulf. Democrats in Congress were concerned. ""Howling in the Congress was loud,"" Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Mr. Bush, wrote in his memoir. ""Was this George Bush, whom some people criticized as a 'wimp,' trying to prove his manhood by starting a war? The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution at the end of November authorizing the use of force against Iraq if it did not leave Kuwait by Jan. 15, 1991. It did not. On Jan. 12, the House and Senate, with bipartisan support, authorized military action in the Persian Gulf. By then Mr. Bush had built a foundation for it: 28 countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union, were behind him. At 3 a.m. in Iraq on Jan. 16, after a midnight deadline had passed without an Iraqi withdrawal, Mr. Bush ordered airstrikes. Waves of bombers and cruise missiles hit Baghdad and targets elsewhere in Iraq and in Kuwait. ""Our goal is not the conquest of Iraq, it is the liberation of Kuwait,"" Mr. Bush said in a televised address. Mr. Hussein proclaimed that the ""mother of all battles has begun."" The war began with a spectacular display of United States air power, as precision missile and bombing runs appeared to be inflicting grave damage on Baghdad. The White House held out hope that this assault alone would win the war, without American casualties, but Pentagon officials realized that a ground invasion was inevitable. When it came, the ground war lasted almost exactly 100 hours, with minimal American casualties. Encircled, the Iraqi Army surrendered. Mr. Bush called a cease-fire, even though it allowed members of the Republican Guard, an elite Iraqi unit, to escape, and even though it left Mr. Hussein in power. General Powell advised Mr. Bush to end the fighting. ""Mr. President, it's going much better than we expected,"" he recalled saying, according to his memoir. ""The Iraqi Army is broken. All they're trying to do now is get out. We don't want to be seen as killing for the sake of killing."" Mr. Bush, by General Powell's account, responded, ""If that's the case, why not end it today?"" Mr. Bush would be called to defend that decision time and again, saying that he had been convinced that Mr. Hussein would be overthrown once the war ended. ""We underestimated his brutality and cruelty to his own people and the stranglehold he has on his country,"" Mr. Bush wrote in February 1991, years before Mr. Hussein was actually ousted. ""We were disappointed, but I still do not regret my decision to end the war when we did."" In the next six months, Mr. Bush balanced urgent demands both abroad and at home. He went to Moscow in July 1991 and signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which slashed the American and Soviet long-range nuclear arsenals by 25 percent to 35 percent. But Mr. Gorbachev was losing his battle to hold on to power. Less than three weeks later, Mr. Bush's loyalty was put to the test when Mr. Gorbachev, his country in economic turmoil, was ousted by hard-liners. Mr. Bush denounced the coup as a ""misguided and illegitimate effort"" and demanded that Mr. Gorbachev be returned to power. For Mr. Bush, it was an uncharacteristically risky move, considering what might have happened to United States-Soviet relations had the generals behind the coup succeeded. The takeover did not last the week. But the disintegration of the Soviet Union was nearly complete. Mr. Gorbachev stepped down on Dec. 25. In Washington, Mr. Bush nominated Judge Clarence Thomas, a 43-year-old United States appeals court judge for the District of Columbia Circuit, to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the retirement of Justice Thurgood Marshall, a champion of civil rights and the first black person to serve on that bench. Judge Thomas, who is also black, soon faced questions about his conservative ideology and accusations of sexual harassment by a former aide, Anita F. Hill. The White House responded by trying to discredit Ms. Hill, and after a pitched battle with Congress, the Senate confirmed Judge Thomas by a vote of 52 to 48, one of the narrowest margins ever for a Supreme Court nomination. (It was a far more contentious nomination than Mr. Bush's choice of David H. Souter, who had been confirmed by the Senate, 90 to 9, the year before.) The 1992 election was still more than a year away, but Mr. Bush was considering his prospects for a second term when he took note of a governor who sought to run against him. ""The stories keep saying I will be very hard to beat: The more we hear of this, the more worried I become,"" he wrote in his diary. ""Bill Clinton, a very nice man, may get into the race."" Then came an Election Day jolt in 1991: Harris Wofford, an obscure Democrat running for the Senate in Pennsylvania and appealing to the economic concerns of the middle class, defeated Dick Thornburgh, an attorney general under both Mr. Bush and Reagan. The next day, Mr. Bush canceled a trip to the Far East, wary of giving Democrats ammunition in portraying him as interested only in foreign policy. He summoned reporters to say the economy was basically sound. ""You see, there's some fairly good fundamentals getting out there,"" he said. ""Inflation is down. Interest rates are down. Personal debt is down. Inventories are down."" But Americans, including Republicans, were dubious. One opinion poll found that only one in four respondents approved of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy. Signaling more trouble, Mr. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, announced that he would challenge Mr. Bush for the Republican nomination. Mr. Bush's 12-day trip to the Far East opened the last full year of his presidency. The White House presented the trip, six weeks before the New Hampshire primary, as an effort to open export markets. Instead it produced what Mr. Bush saw as one of the most damaging moments of his time in office. At a state dinner in Tokyo hosted by Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, Mr. Bush turned white, vomited on his host and fainted. Mr. Miyazawa cradled Mr. Bush's head as the president crumpled to the floor, an unsettling image that dominated the news for days. Mr. Bush came home to a bleak domestic picture. Unemployment was at 7.1 percent, the highest level in six years. A New York Times/CBS News opinion poll found that just one-fifth of Americans thought Mr. Bush cared about their problems. When Mr. Bush visited New Hampshire in mid-January, his anxiety was evident the moment he stepped off Air Force One. ""I probably have made mistakes in assessing the fact that the economy would recover,"" he said. ""I think I've known, look, this economy is in free fall. I hope I've known it. Maybe I haven't conveyed it as well as I should have, but I do understand it."" Mr. Buchanan drew 37 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, unwelcome news for the beleaguered Mr. Bush. The president's advisers promptly sent him to 22 cities in 20 days. He attacked welfare, big government and trial lawyers, and rued the day he had agreed to raise taxes, calling his decision to renege on his tax pledge the biggest mistake of his presidency. Mr. Bush stopped his slide by solidly beating Mr. Buchanan in South Carolina. Clearly relieved, the president said he would cut back his campaign trips. But Mr. Buchanan's candidacy had highlighted Mr. Bush's political frailty, forced him to act as a candidate rather than as a president, and pushed him rightward as Mr. Clinton seized the center. There was little respite for Mr. Bush as he prepared for the nominating convention in Houston. At that point he had to deal with the prospect of a populist third-party challenge from Mr. Perot. Mr. Bush shrugged off the threat at first. ""Perot will be defined, seen, as a weirdo,"" he wrote that spring, referring to Mr. Perot's eccentric ways and folksy style. (He was drawn to conspiracy theories, among other things, and hired private detectives to chase his suspicions.) But Mr. Perot had captured the public's imagination. He presented himself as the symbol of change and did not play by the rules of traditional politics. Alarmed Republicans were blunt. At a fund-raiser in Charlotte, N.C., the president was visibly uncomfortable watching a video in which Senator Jesse Helms complained about Mr. Bush's campaign. ""Mr. President,"" Mr. Helms said, ""tell them once again, 'Read my lips,' but this time with gusto."" Mr. Bush fixated on Mr. Clinton's political skills. Mr. Clinton was ""better at facts-figures, than I am,"" he wrote to an adviser. ""I am better at life."" He also complained to supporters that he was not getting the credit he deserved for the fall of communism, the handling of the Persian Gulf war and the arms control treaties. ""I have worked my heart out as president of the United States,"" he said. Mr. Clinton was nominated by a confident, united Democratic Party in New York in July. Republicans went on the attack, portraying him as a man of character flaws that made him unfit to lead. Mr. Clinton responded with equal force. ""George Bush,"" he said, ""if you won't use your power to help people, step aside. I will."" Mr. Clinton's convention was a success. In a New York Times/CBS News opinion poll, he had the biggest postconvention bounce in 50 years, leading Mr. Bush 55 percent to 31 percent. Republicans despaired. Under pressure to shake up his White House, Mr. Bush pressed his old friend Mr. Baker to leave the State Department and return as White House chief of staff. Mr. Bush accepted the nomination to run for a second term with a promise to cut taxes, a pledge to curb spending, an attack on Mr. Clinton's credentials and — once again — an apology for having broken his tax cut pledge. ""Who do you trust in this election?"" he said as Republican delegates in Houston roared their approval. ""The candidate who raised taxes one time and regrets it, or the other candidate, who raised taxes and fees 128 times and enjoyed it every time?"" The convention was dominated by angry appeals to the party's conservative wing, notably by Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Robertson, who were given prime-time slots to speak against abortion rights and gay rights. By the end of the month, a New York Times/CBS News poll showed that Mr. Clinton still had a resounding lead of 51 percent to 26 percent. Mr. Bush remained ostensibly confident. ""I can make it; I can out hustle Clinton; out work him; out jog him; out campaign him; and we'll win,"" he wrote in his diary. But his campaign was frantic. He jumped from offering an economic plan one day to attacking Mr. Clinton's character the next, referring to Mr. Clinton's military draft exemptions, his dabbling with marijuana and his protests against the Vietnam War while a student. Mr. Bush's attacks escalated as the weather turned cold. ""My dog Millie knows more about foreign affairs than those two bozos,"" he said of Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee. But on Nov. 3, Mr. Clinton defeated Mr. Bush, 43 percent to 37 percent, with Mr. Perot drawing almost 19 percent. Mr. Bush believed he would have won were it not for Mr. Perot, Mr. Baker said. That weekend, a dispirited Mr. Bush retreated with General Powell to Camp David in Maryland, where they watched the movie ""Enchanted April"" and tried to understand what had just happened. ""I just never thought they'd elect him,"" Mr. Bush told General Powell. ""Don't understand it. But life goes on."" Mr. Bush had not expected such an early retirement. He and Mrs. Bush did not even really have a place to go: Their base in Houston was a hotel suite, and the Kennebunkport retreat had not been winterized. But Mr. Bush was not finished with his presidency. At Christmas, he pardoned six Reagan administration officials who had been involved in the arms-for-hostages scandal. One, former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, was about to stand trial on charges that he had lied to Congress about his knowledge of arms sales to Iran. The trial would have opened up private notes referring to Mr. Bush's support for the secret arms shipment. The special prosecutor in the case, Lawrence E. Walsh, assailed the pardons. ""The Iran-contra cover-up, which has continued for more than six years, has now been completed,"" he said. Mr. Bush returned to Russia for a final foreign policy triumph. He and President Boris N. Yeltsin signed a Start II agreement providing for the steepest rollback of nuclear arms yet. Then, on Jan. 20, 1993, Mr. Bush took one last walk around the White House grounds. Mr. Bush spent the rest of his life more as an observer than as a player, watching as one son was elected president twice and as another was elected governor twice before attempting his own run for the presidency. He joined Mr. Clinton in raising money for disaster relief efforts. His public profile dropped as criticism of his son's presidency mounted, and there were reports that foreign policy advisers to the elder Mr. Bush had counseled against the war in Iraq that so troubled George W. Bush's presidency. As Mr. Bush moved into the final years of his life, there were signs that time had left him behind. A handful of women accused him of inappropriately touching them as they were having their pictures taken with him. Mr. Bush's office said the gestures, he patted them on the rear, were meant in a good-natured manner, but said: ""to anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely."" Mr. Bush was never a man comfortable with self-examination, but in an interview with Mr. Meacham, his biographer, he evinced some insecurity about how history might judge him. ""I am lost between the glory of Reagan — monuments everywhere, trumpets, the great hero — and the trials and tribulations of my sons,"" Mr. Bush said. At another point, he asked of those who would examine his career, ""What if they just find an empty deck of cards?"" But the 41st president may have best summed up his talents and ambitions in a diary entry on the last day of 1989, as the first year of his presidency drew to a close. ""I'm certainly not seen as visionary,"" Mr. Bush wrote. ""But I hope I'm seen as steady and prudent and able."""
News,2018-12-01,"Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former personal lawyer who has twice pleaded guilty to crimes that have implicated Mr. Trump in illegal or questionable conduct, asked a federal judge late Friday night that he be allowed to avoid prison when he is sentenced in less than two weeks.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/01/nyregion/michael-cohen-leniency.html,1011," Michael D. Cohen, President Trump's former personal lawyer who has twice pleaded guilty to crimes that have implicated Mr. Trump in illegal or questionable conduct, asked a federal judge late Friday night that he be allowed to avoid prison when he is sentenced in less than two weeks. In a deeply personal memorandum that expressed Mr. Cohen's contrition and shame, defense lawyers portrayed him as a man whose personal and professional lives had been shattered, and who had harmed himself legally while trying to protect Mr. Trump. Arguing against a prison sentence, the lawyers cited Mr. Cohen's cooperation with the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, whose legitimacy is regularly denounced by the president. ""In the context of this raw, full-bore attack by the most powerful person in the United States,"" the lawyers wrote, ""Michael, formerly a confidant and adviser to Mr. Trump, resolved to cooperate, and voluntarily took the first steps toward doing so even before he was charged."" The lawyers noted that Mr. Cohen could have fought the government, ""positioning himself perhaps for a pardon or clemency,"" but instead took personal responsibility for his wrongdoing ""and is prepared to continue to contribute to an investigation that he views as thoroughly legitimate and vital."" The lawyers, Guy Petrillo and Amy Lester, submitted the memo one day after Mr. Cohen entered a surprise guilty plea in federal court in Manhattan to a charge of lying to Congress in a case filed by Mr. Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential ties to Mr. Trump's campaign. In August, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and financial crimes in a case brought by the United States attorney in Manhattan. In that plea, Mr. Cohen implicated Mr. Trump in hush-money payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to conceal affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen, 52, is to be sentenced by Judge William H. Pauley III on Dec. 12 on the charges in both cases. The government is also expected to file a sentencing memo. The Cohen memo offered no new revelations about alleged misconduct involving the president, but it shed new light on Mr. Cohen's role in the various investigations being conducted into Mr. Trump and his inner circle, and on his frequent contact with the president's legal counsel and advisers as he prepared for congressional testimony that he later admitted was false. The document provided a detailed, on-the-record glimpse of what took place between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump in relation to arranging payments to two women who said during the 2016 campaign that they had previously had affairs with the candidate. The memo refers to ""Woman-1,"" who appears to be Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who was paid by The National Enquirer for her story. The magazine, whose chief executive, David Pecker, is friends with Mr. Trump, then killed the story. The memo mentions that ""Client-1,"" as Mr. Trump is described throughout, did not reimburse the corporation that owns the tabloid for the payments to her, as he had agreed to. The document depicts Mr. Cohen as an unsophisticated and flawed man who was trying to please an exacting, demanding and powerful boss: Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen's lawyers wrote that he realized his guilt in lying to Congress about the duration of his involvement with a Trump Tower project he was exploring for Moscow. Mr. Cohen consulted with White House staff members and Mr. Trump's ""legal counsel"" as he prepared for his false congressional testimony, though it did not identify the lawyer, according to the memo. The document did not say if Mr. Cohen was asked to lie, nor did it identify which counsel he spoke with. But the lawyers wrote that Mr. Cohen had consulted with Mr. Trump's aides because he knew the president wanted to ""dismiss and minimize the merit"" of the special counsel's inquiry, and that Mr. Trump and his aides ""were seeking to portray contact with Russian representatives in any form by Client-1, the campaign or the Trump Organization as having effectively terminated before the Iowa caucuses of Feb. 1, 2016."" Mr. Cohen's false statements to Congress and his assistance to Mr. Trump with the hush-money payments arose out of his ""fierce loyalty"" to Mr. Trump, the lawyers wrote. ""Michael regrets that his vigor in promoting Client-1's interests in the heat of political battle led him to abandon good judgment and cross legal lines,"" they added. The memo said that Mr. Cohen had met seven times with Mr. Mueller's prosecutors — the first time on Aug. 7, two weeks before he entered his first guilty plea — and that he intended to keep making himself available when needed for additional questioning. It revealed that he had also met twice with federal prosecutors in Manhattan — and would continue to do so if needed — responding to their questions concerning ""an ongoing investigation,"" which the memo did not describe. The memo noted that Mr. Mueller's office was expected to provide the judge with an assessment of Mr. Cohen's cooperation, and that the Manhattan prosecutors were to join in presenting Mr. Cohen's assistance as a factor for the judge to consider. The memo disclosed that Mr. Cohen had also met voluntarily with investigators from the New York attorney general's office regarding a lawsuit it has brought against Mr. Trump and his foundation. Mr. Cohen also provided the attorney general's office with documents concerning ""a separate open inquiry,"" the memo added, also offering no elaboration. Threaded throughout the document were testimonials from people closest to Mr. Cohen — drawn from some three dozen letters that were also submitted — depicting an image of generosity that undercuts the public perceptions of him since his guilty plea. The most powerful letter was from his 83-year-old father, Maurice Cohen, a Holocaust survivor, who wrote that his son is ""the oxygen in the air that I breathe."" ""I pray and beg, beg and pray that you won't take my oxygen away from me,"" the elder Mr. Cohen wrote."
News,2018-12-01,"George Bush played baseball at Yale, as his father had, and he became captain of the university’s team in 1948. Poppy, as he was known in his years as a student, was a popular player, and he was known for his sense of humor.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/01/obituaries/george-bushs-life-in-13-objects.html,3251," George Bush played baseball at Yale, as his father had, and he became captain of the university's team in 1948. Poppy, as he was known in his years as a student, was a popular player, and he was known for his sense of humor. When he was president, he kept his first baseman's glove in a drawer of his desk in the Oval Office. He oiled it regularly and often used it to concentrate, putting it on to sock his hand in while he was thinking. The sport brought Mr. Bush great pleasure. He and his wife, Barbara, often invited Houston Astros players for lunch in Texas, and he once brought President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to a Baltimore Orioles game. Even after vascular disease began to limit Mr. Bush's movements, sports and the outdoors were still important to him. He still spent summers in Maine and enjoyed time on his speedboat, the Fidelity. ""Nobody asks me to be on the team anymore,"" he said in the HBO documentary ""41."" But with boats, ""I'm still in the game."" [George Bush, a one-term president who steered the nation through a tumultuous period in world affairs, dies at 94.] Mr. Bush was a member of Skull and Bones, a secretive undergraduate society at Yale. Several of his family members had also been ""Bonesmen,"" including his father, brother, uncles, great-uncle and a cousin, and his son George W. Bush later became part of the group. This Skull and Bones mascot is from the society's 1879 photo album, the year after William Howard Taft was selected for membership. For Mr. Bush, the elite network was like an extended family. Bonesmen helped him get his first job in the oil industry, and several invested in his oil ventures. Others offered financial support for his election campaigns, and some served under him as advisers, speechwriters, ambassadors and cabinet members. But being a member of an elite and secretive society also presented a challenge for Mr. Bush, who struggled to shake off an image of being out of touch with ordinary Americans. In the 1992 presidential campaign, the candidate Patrick J. Buchanan criticized Mr. Bush for having run a Skull and Bones presidency. Rumors about the society's rituals, and theories about its influence on the American government, deeply frustrated Mr. Bush and his family. One day in 1953, Barbara Bush found that her normally active 3-year-old daughter, Robin, was pale, sluggish and covered in bruises. That afternoon, the Bushes learned that their daughter had advanced leukemia. Over the next few months, Mrs. Bush traveled repeatedly between Texas and New York, where Robin was treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. After roughly six months, the hospital performed surgery after it found that Robin's treatments had caused internal bleeding. She died two months before her fourth birthday. This portrait of Robin, painted by Louise VandenBergh Altson in 1953, was a gift from Mr. Bush's mother. It was displayed prominently in the family's home in Midland, Tex., and remains in their Houston home today. Mr. Bush struggled with Robin's illness, admitting later that he ""didn't have the guts"" to comfort and care for her. But Mrs. Bush never left Robin's side. After the child's death, Mr. Bush helped his grieving wife keep busy with volunteer work and social functions. Their 7-year-old son, George, tried to distract his mother by making her laugh. The Bushes were determined to move forward. After the births of two more boys, Mr. and Mrs. Bush had another daughter, in August 1959. That daughter, Dorothy, was ""a wild, dark version of Robin,"" Mr. Bush wrote. After graduating from Yale in 1948, Mr. Bush moved to West Texas to work at an oil-equipment company run by a close friend of his father's and financed by his father's employer, the investment firm Brown Brothers. A few years later, he and three partners founded Zapata Oil, a contract drilling company in Midland, Tex. They named it after ""Viva Zapata!"", a Marlon Brando movie about the Mexican rebel Emiliano Zapata, who fought to protect lands owned by peasants. The name evoked being in the vanguard, but many viewed it as an odd choice in a town of privilege. In the late 1950s, the company began operations in the Gulf of Mexico and the Persian Gulf. Although the company faltered at the time, it highlighted the potential of offshore drilling. Mr. Bush and his partners split up Zapata, and he took the helm of the Zapata Off-Shore Company. During his travels for that company, Mr. Bush made important political connections: He befriended King Hussein of Jordan and built Kuwait's first offshore oil well with the approval of the ruling al-Sabah family, which the United States restored to power after the Persian Gulf war of 1991. As he increasingly focused his attention on politics, he sold his stake in the company, netting about $1 million, or more than $8 million in today's dollars. In the mid-1960s, Mr. Bush moved his family to the wealthy suburbs of Houston to expand Zapata Off-Shore and to begin his political career. Around the same time, his son, George W. Bush, confided in friends at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., that his father's ambition was to reach the White House. Mr. Bush joined the Houston Country Club, the Ramada Club and the Bayou Club, and he and Mrs. Bush had an active social life. He became known for writing thank-you notes to almost anyone whose path crossed his, and Mrs. Bush kept notecards to keep track of their growing social network. (The cards reportedly numbered in the tens of thousands by the time the Bushes reached the White House). It was at the Houston Country Club that Mr. Bush developed a friendship that he would carry to the Oval Office: He began playing tennis with a 34-year-old lawyer, James A. Baker III, shown here in a snapshot from one of Mrs. Bush's more than 200 scrapbooks. The two men were an odd but complementary pair, and they shared big political goals. Mr. Baker became an important ally in Mr. Bush's political life, overseeing his Senate campaign in 1970 (which was unsuccessful) and his run for the presidential nomination in 1980 (he became vice president to Ronald Reagan). He then became secretary of state in the Bush administration in 1989, and chief of staff in 1992. In 1975, President Gerald R. Ford asked Mr. Bush to serve as director of the C.I.A. Mr. Bush viewed the position as a detour, one that would prevent him from being named vice president and would keep him away from the Oval Office. But moved by a sense of duty, he accepted. Mr. Bush became director in 1976, not long after the Watergate scandal and the end of the Vietnam War. Stories of domestic spying on antiwar protesters and of plots to assassinate international leaders dominated the headlines, and the public was skeptical of intelligence services. In 12 months as director of the agency, Mr. Bush appeared 51 times on Capitol Hill to defend the C.I.A.'s activities. Despite early criticism that he was too partisan for the C.I.A., Mr. Bush became known at the agency, and by many in Washington, as one of its best directors. In 1999, the agency renamed its headquarters the George Bush Center for Intelligence. Mr. Bush is credited with balancing Congress's requests for more oversight with the C.I.A.'s ability to conduct intelligence and to protect its agents. He is also known for having raised the morale of staff members, in part because of his casual leadership style. He rode the employee elevator rather than a private one, went jogging on the basement track, and wrote many thank-you notes. He even let disguise experts transform him with red hair, a big nose and thick glasses before an important meeting, at which he gave himself up, exclaiming: ""I'm sweating under this thing!"" Mr. Bush faced long odds as he entered the 1980 Republican primary. He had served in government for more than a decade but was still unknown to most Americans, having been elected only twice, representing the Seventh District of Texas in the House of Representatives. The clear party favorite was Mr. Reagan, shown here with Mr. Bush on a commemorative button for their second inauguration. The former Hollywood actor and governor of California charmed voters with his grandfatherly style and an ability to speak clearly on issues. Campaign consultants told Mr. Bush that he would have a chance of winning only if Mr. Reagan faltered. In the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Bush got the lift he needed, beating Mr. Reagan by roughly 2,000 votes, what he called his ""Big Mo."" Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, the two leading Republican candidates, agreed to face off in a debate before the New Hampshire primary. The Federal Election Commission required that all candidates be present, however, so Mr. Reagan offered to finance a two-candidate debate with his own campaign money. To Mr. Bush's surprise, Mr. Reagan ended up inviting all of the candidates to participate in the debate. Mr. Reagan had an angry exchange with the moderator, who demanded that the candidate's microphone be turned off. ""I'm paying for this microphone, Mr. Green,"" Mr. Reagan said, a line that Spencer Tracy had used in the 1948 film ""State of the Union."" The crowd cheered, and Mr. Reagan beat Mr. Bush by nearly two to one in the state. By the middle of the year, Mr. Reagan had the support of enough delegates for the Republican nomination, but Mr. Bush had enough support to persuade Mr. Reagan to take him on as a running mate. They beat Jimmy Carter and Walter F. Mondale in a landslide, with 489 electoral votes to 49. Four years later, they beat Mr. Mondale and Geraldine A. Ferraro by an even larger margin, setting up Mr. Bush for his own successful presidential run. At the Republican National Convention in New Orleans in 1988, Mr. Bush announced that he had chosen a young senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle, as his running mate. It was believed that Mr. Quayle, 41, could draw support from women and young voters, as well as from conservatives and the religious right. (The official bust of Vice President Dan Quayle, modeled more than a decade after the election, is on display in the Senate wing of the Capitol.) When questioned by the news media about his past, Mr. Quayle came across as shaky and inexperienced. He ultimately got more attention from the television networks than did Mr. Bush, who acknowledged in his diaries: ""It was my decision, and I blew it, but I'm not about to say that I blew it."" Mr. Bush's sons and his campaign chairman, Mr. Baker, did not support the choice of Mr. Quayle as running mate. It seemed so unusual that some family members and the news media speculated that it was part of a strategy to prevent impeachment proceedings against Mr. Bush, as Congress was investigating the Iran-contra scandal at the time, and Mr. Bush's involvement in it. Mr. Quayle became known for his public gaffes. At a spelling bee in Trenton in 1992, he encouraged a 12-year-old to add an ""e"" to the end of ""potato."" Although many thought that these sorts of missteps were a liability for the Bush administration, Mr. Bush kept his No. 2 on the ticket in 1992. Mr. Bush's ties to the Saudi royal family, and to Saudi Arabia more generally, were so strong that he was once known in the Middle East as the ""Saudi vice president."" His friendship with King Fahd is credited with making Saudi Arabia a strong ally, especially through the Persian Gulf war. This 14-karat gold model of the Masmak Fort in Riyadh was a gift to Mr. Bush from King Fahd in 1992. Even after Mr. Bush left the White House, his family maintained close ties with members of the Saudi royal family. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, and his wife said that the Bushes were ""almost family."" Mrs. Bush said she felt the same way, and she affectionately called the prince Bandar Bush. Friendships between the two families have extended beyond the diplomatic and the social. King Fahd contributed $1 million to Mrs. Bush's campaign against illiteracy in 1989; Prince Bandar gave $1 million to the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in 1997; and Prince Alwaleed bin Talal gave $500,000 to Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., in 2002 to fund a scholarship in Mr. Bush's name. Mr. Bush has also used the close ties to foster business opportunities. In 2000, for example, he visited the crown prince at a luxurious compound in Saudi Arabia, in the capacity of senior adviser for the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. By the time Mr. Bush became president in 1989, his wife — ""Bar,"" as he affectionately called her — was so well liked that her approval ratings were higher than his own. Mrs. Bush was liked for her matronly style, her self-deprecating humor and her warmth. Her popularity was so broad that even her best-selling book, ""Millie's Book,"" written in the voice of the family springer spaniel, made significantly more in royalties than ""Looking Forward,"" the autobiography Mr. Bush wrote before the 1988 campaign. Known in the family as the ""silver fox"" and the ""enforcer,"" Mrs. Bush fiercely defended her husband's reputation and was said to have had a strong influence on his opinions of people. But even when her views differed from those of her husband — she once admitted that she was an abortion rights advocate — she did not try to change Mr. Bush's opinion. ""I'm not a wave maker,"" she once said. ""I do not agree with my husband on everything, and I'm not going to tell you if I don't agree. Because I'm going to tell George Bush how I feel. Upstairs."" Mrs. Bush's influence on her husband's professional life was not immediate. She spent the first decades of her marriage as a housewife, caring for six children and nurturing the couple's social ties, often staying at home alone while Mr. Bush traveled for his work or for his political ambitions. The arrangement took a toll, and Mrs. Bush sometimes grappled with depression during her husband's long absences. Mrs. Bush died on April 17 at age 92. In his 1989 campaign for the presidency, Mr. Bush, a former oil executive, promised to be the ""environmental president."" He vowed to strengthen the Clean Air Act and to find common ground between economic and environmental interests. After taking office, he appointed a professional conservationist to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Paradoxically, a major environmental catastrophe, and one of the largest oil spills in American history, occurred during Mr. Bush's tenure in the White House. In March 1989, the Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground on Bligh Reef, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound in Alaska. The spill damaged 1,500 miles of coastline, killed hundreds of thousands of marine mammals and birds, and devastated local communities. This $20 bill, dirtied with the oiled fingerprints of a worker on the cleanup effort, is just one of hundreds of objects linked to the spill that the Valdez Museum has collected. Exxon was held responsible for the disaster, and Mr. Bush was mostly spared criticism. While Congress was initially critical of the administration's slow response, the president subsequently sent many high-level officials to Alaska, including the head of the E.P.A., the transportation secretary, the commander of the Coast Guard, the interior secretary and the vice president. Ultimately, the spill is thought to have worked in his favor, as it is credited with encouraging lawmakers and the public to support amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990. But for some who were hit directly by the effects of the spill, the federal government's response was lacking. ""The Bush legacy in Prince William Sound is oiled beaches, sick wildlife, sick former cleanup workers, and a lot of hardships that the towns survived — all costs of America's oil dependency that have been swept under the carpet,"" said Riki Ott, a local resident and marine toxicologist. In 1988, Mr. Bush campaigned with the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, and many have thought of him as a supporter of gun rights. During his presidency, he stalled the passing of the federal Brady bill that would have required a five-day waiting period to buy handguns, to allow for background checks. But in 1995, Mr. Bush wrote a letter to the rifle association rescinding his lifetime membership. He was responding to comments by Wayne LaPierre of the N.R.A., who had said that the Clinton administration's ""semiauto ban gives jackbooted government thugs more power to take away our constitutional rights, break in our doors, seize our guns, destroy our property, and even injure or kill us."" That language offended a ""sense of decency and honor,"" Mr. Bush wrote. ""It indirectly slanders a wide array of government law enforcement officials, who are out there, day and night, laying their lives on the line for all of us."" Critics of Mr. Bush's change in position said that he had long been a supporter of gun control, but that he had joined the rifle association only to appeal to voters in the 1988 election. Mr. Bush had supported gun control during his failed Senate campaign in 1970, and as president, he favored a ban on the import of some semiautomatic weapons. Because of this, and because he did not vigorously oppose the Brady Bill, the N.R.A. declined to endorse him during his 1992 re-election campaign. Mr. Bush moved his family roughly three dozen times, and he traveled the world for business and politics, but he has spent nearly every summer at his family's retreat in Kennebunkport, Me. There, family members said he could truly relax and be himself. For all of Mr. Bush's attempts to portray himself as a lover of Texas barbecue and pork rinds, and despite its being a symbol of his affluent New England upbringing, he never let go of his Kennebunkport home. This 1989 postcard shows an aerial view of the 10-acre property. While it has provided a place for family, leisure and sport, Mr. Bush has also used it for business and political work. As a young Texas oil executive, he and his uncle wooed investors there with a dip in the Atlantic, a warm towel and a martini. When Mr. Bush was president, Kennebunkport became the summer office of the White House, a spot where his grandchildren bumped into diplomats, cabinet members and heads of state. In August 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the president held meetings with his national security adviser there, and began early talks on building a coalition with Saudi Arabia's foreign minister and its ambassador to the United States. Mrs. Bush noted in her memoirs that her husband was happy only when all of the beds at the home, which sleeps 34 people, were full. Guests included Bill Clinton and the CBS sportscaster Jim Nantz. ""Your mother and I sit out here like a couple of really old poops,"" Mr. Bush once wrote to his children, ""but we are at total peace.""

News,2018-12-01,"SÃO PAULO, Brazil — For Natalia and Rubens Ortega, the only remaining question is: Glock or Taurus?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/01/world/americas/brazil-gun-laws-rights-bolsonaro.html,1217," SÃO PAULO, Brazil — For Natalia and Rubens Ortega, the only remaining question is: Glock or Taurus? The young couple signed up for a gun-training course at a shooting club in São Paulo just days after Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right former Army captain, was elected Brazil's next president on the strength of his promise to upend the status quo and combat crime. For a population angered by the last few years of political and economic turmoil and worried by escalating violence, Mr. Bolsonaro's vow to break with Brazil's restrictive attitude toward weapons and make it easier for ""good guys"" to own guns was particularly resonant. ""We want to get back in practice so we can buy a pistol when it happens,"" said Mr. Ortega, who has joined a wave of Brazilians preparing for a widely expected relaxing of gun restrictions. ""We just can't decide which one."" Mr. Bolsonaro's tough-on-crime stance helped catapult him to the head of a splintered race in a country reeling from a record-level epidemic of violence. Last year there were roughly 175 homicides per day in Brazil, according to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. Often simulating gunfire with his fingers at campaign rallies, Mr. Bolsonaro said he would combat the homicide epidemic by easing firearm laws and giving the police more freedom to shoot suspects. ""We have to stop this politically correct thing, saying that disarming everyone will make Brazil a better place — it won't,"" Mr. Bolsonaro said in his first post-election television interview, pointing out that the strict regulations now in place have failed to stem the flow of firearms into the hands of criminals. These regulations were created at the turn of the 21st century, when civil society, faced with rising violence and the explosion of the cocaine trade in Brazil, stepped up pressure on the government to register firearms and regulate their use. Congress responded. A restrictive law known as the Disarmament Statute, approved in 2003, required applicants to be at least 25 years old, have no criminal history, provide proof of a steady job and fixed residence, pass a psychological test and have gun training. The regulation also gave Brazilians two options: They can get a license for a self-defense firearm, which must be stored exclusively at home or at a place of work; or for a sporting weapon, which can be stored at home and carried to authorized shooting clubs, always with full documentation. In the case of a firearm for self-defense, the applicant must also formally declare why a gun is needed and have that argument approved by the police. Faced with such an onerous registration process, many gun owners opted to surrender their firearms. Brazil's murder rate declined 12 percent in the four years after the statute was approved. But then homicides started to climb again, setting a record in 2017 of 30.8 per 100,000 people, according to the Brazilian Forum of Public Security, a research organization. (The United States had five homicides per 100,000 people in 2015 — the most recent year for which data are available — down from eight per 100,000 in 1996. Even Mexico had a lower murder rate of 25 per 100,000 last year.) Sales of legal firearms, which also diminished immediately after the Disarmament Statute was introduced, skyrocketed years later. By 2017, there were 42,387 new guns registered with the police, compared with 5,159 in 2004. Mr. Bolsonaro's promise to ease gun regulation and give the police greater freedom to shoot is worrying some experts who argue that more guns fuel more violence and that police aggression needs to be curbed, not encouraged. The police in Brazil killed 5,144 people in 2017, a 20 percent increase over the year before. The vast majority of firearms used by criminals were at one time legally acquired — and legal firearms also cause many deaths as a result of accidents, domestic abuse and disagreements that spiral out of control, said Ivan Marques, the executive director of the Sou da Paz Institute, which focuses on security issues. Studies show that having more firearms in circulation increases the number of deaths, but ""there are no magic solutions,"" said Ilona Szabó, the director of the Igarapé Institute, a research group that focuses on security issues. ""We need sustainable measures that make the country safer."" Despite the enthusiasm for Mr. Bolsonaro and anger over the public security crisis, most Brazilians — 55 percent, in a poll conducted by Datafolha right before the elections — think civilian gun ownership should be banned, although this number has gone down from 68 percent in 2013, when the polling firm Datafolha first conducted a survey asking that question. Luciana Burr, a lawyer from São Paulo, says she has been robbed at gunpoint six times. The first time, she was 15 years old. Later, she was held up in a ""flash kidnapping"" with her 5-year-old son in the car. They were driven around for two hours while armed teenagers forced them to take cash out of A.T.M.s. Still, she staunchly opposes allowing citizens to carry guns, arguing that being armed would not have helped her. ""I was caught by surprise every single time,"" she said, adding, ""I don't want some 'good citizen' deciding to step in with a gun. I don't want someone making that decision for me — the risk is too big."" A number of proposals backed by the ""bullet lobby,"" a group of lawmakers, have been introduced in Congress in an effort to relax gun restrictions. Within days of Mr. Bolsonaro's victory, representatives keen on impressing the president-elect pushed to vote on a bill, first introduced in 2012, that would lower the age limit for gun ownership to 21 and would not require applicants to prove the need to be armed. It appears likely that they will vote on the bill after Jan. 1, when Mr. Bolsonaro and his new allies in Congress take office. Conservatives from his Social Liberal Party won 52 seats, up from eight, making it the second largest party in the lower house. Stocks in the Brazilian firearm manufacturer Forjas Taurus surged more than 400 percent ahead of the presidential elections on expectations that a Bolsonaro victory would pave the way for a boom in sales, although financial concerns over the company have since eroded some of those gains. The euphoria surrounding Mr. Bolsonaro's rise in polls also prompted a flood of phone calls to the Centaurus shooting academy from people interested in courses, guidance on how laws could change, or target practice at its two-story house converted into a classroom and four-lane shooting range. ""There has been a big surge in demand thanks to my man, Bolsonaro,"" said Nelson de Oliveira Jr., a former police officer who opened the Centaurus shooting academy in São Paulo in 2003, just before Brazil's then left-wing government introduced the Disarmament Statute. Among them are the Ortegas, who signed up for gun training at the shooting academy and see the ability to carry a weapon as a deterrent to the kind of armed robbery Ms. Ortega says she suffered two months before Mr. Bolsonaro was elected. ""Right now, only the criminals have guns,"" she said. ""I'm not going to run around the streets with a gun in my hand, but a criminal might think twice if normal citizens could be armed."""

Linda McCrae, a Disciples of Christ minister, performed the ceremony, with the Rev.

The Rev. Linda McCrae, a Disciples of Christ minister, performed the ceremony, with the Rev. Robert Crawford, also a Disciples of Christ minister, taking part. The bride, 34, is the director of development for Church Extension Financial and Missional Resources in Indianapolis. She graduated from Smith College in Northampton, Mass., and received a master's degree in divinity from the University of Chicago. She is the daughter of Rev. Dr. Sharon E. Watkins and the Rev. Dr. Richard H. Lowery of Bethany, W.Va. The bride's father is the president of the Disciples of Christ Historical Society in Bethany. Her mother is the director of the Truth and Racial Justice Initiative for the National Council of Churches in Washington. She preached the inaugural prayer service for President Barack Obama's first inauguration in 2009 while serving as general minister and president of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in the United States and Canada. The groom, 38, is a corporate compliance program director for Eskenazi Health, a hospital in Indianapolis. He graduated from Indiana University and received a law degree from Valparaiso University. He is a son of Joan K. Zielinski and Ronald T. Zielinski of South Bend, Ind. The groom's mother is an elementary schoolteacher at St. Pius X Catholic School in Granger, Ind. His father retired as a financial analyst for the Executive Office of the U.S. Trustee in the Justice Department in South Bend. The groom's previous marriage ended in divorce. The couple met in May, 2017 through the dating app Bumble. ""I found Joe's profile refreshing,"" Ms. Lowery said. ""There were no vanity photos or Kurt Vonnegut quotes. Instead he talked about his love of volunteering, which drew me to him."" ""He seemed down-to-earth and thoughtful,"" she added, ""without trying too hard to impress."" Mr. Zielinski was immediately attracted to a picture of Ms. Lowery standing in front of the United States Capitol at the 2017 Women's March. ""I could tell that she was strong and independent,"" he said. On their first date, at a professional soccer game in Indianapolis, Mr. Zielinski playfully said to Ms. Lowery that if the game had been rained out, he was prepared to impress her with his knowledge of 19th-century feminists. ""At the end of that date, I texted my brother that I had just met my wife,"" Mr. Zielinski said. ""We got along so naturally, I didn't have to try and be anyone else around her but myself."" They began seeing each other as often as possible, and despite a stark difference in personalities — ""she is outgoing and tends to be dramatic,"" he said, while ""he is more the quiet and analytical type,"" she said — they found those differences to be complementary. Within three weeks, they had exchanged ""I love yous,"" and within three months, they were so convinced they had a future together that they began shopping for wedding rings. ""It may have seemed to the outsider that we were moving too quickly, but we are both at an age where we know ourselves very well and were able to see just how well suited we are as lifelong partners,"" Ms. Lowery said. ""We share the same values of love for family, loyalty to friends, and service to our broader community. ""He encourages me to reach for all the professional and personal dreams I have, and I want him to succeed in every leadership role he takes on at work or in our community,"" she added. ""We really are each other's number one fan."" He proposed in November 2017 during a trip to Washington that included Ms. Lowery's parents and her grandfather. When he stopped suddenly to kneel at a spot on the Washington Mall with the Capitol in the background — just as he had first seen her online — she nearly ran him over. ""I guess it was a combination of excitement and nervousness as I was hoping she would say yes,"" Mr. Zielinski said, laughing. ""Now there's a lifetime of excitement ahead of us."""

Cohen admitted this past week to lying to Congress about a Russian business deal, he said he had testified falsely out of loyalty to President Trump.

Cohen admitted this past week to lying to Congress about a Russian business deal, he said he had testified falsely out of loyalty to President Trump. When he admitted this summer to lying on campaign finance records about payments to cover up a sex scandal during the campaign, he said it was at Mr. Trump's direction. Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, former senior Trump campaign officials, lied to cover up financial fraud. George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide, lied in hopes of landing an administration job. And Michael T. Flynn, another adviser, lied about his interactions with a Russian official and about other matters for reasons that remain unclear. If the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has proved anything in his 18-month-long investigation — besides how intensely Russia meddled in an American presidential election — it is that Mr. Trump surrounded himself throughout 2016 and early 2017 with people to whom lying seemed to be second nature. They lied to federal authorities even when they had lawyers advising them, even when the risk of getting caught was high and even when the consequences for them were dire. Even more Trump associates are under investigation for the same offense. They are part of a group of people surrounding Mr. Trump — including some White House and cabinet officials — who contribute to a culture of bending, if not outright breaking, the truth, and whose leading exemplar is Mr. Trump himself. Mr. Trump looks for people who share his disregard for the truth and are willing to parrot him, ""even if it's a lie, even if they know it's a lie, and even if he said the opposite the day before,"" said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer. They must be ""loyal to what he is saying right now,"" she said, or he sees them as ""a traitor."" Campaign aides often echoed Mr. Trump's pronouncements knowing they were false. People joined the top levels of his administration with the realization that they would be expected to embrace what Mr. Trump said, no matter how far from the truth or how much their reputations suffered. For Sean Spicer, the first White House press secretary, that included falsely insisting, on Mr. Trump's first day in office, that his inaugural crowd was the biggest in history. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who replaced him, dialed back once-daily news briefings to once every few weeks as her credibility was increasingly battered. For decades, such behavior was relatively free of consequence for those who aligned with Mr. Trump. The stakes in the real estate world were lower, and deceptive statements could be dismissed as hardball business tactics or just efforts to cultivate the Trump mystique. If Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds evidence that Mr. Trump broke the law, he will have decisions to make about how to proceed. We explain them. But in Mr. Mueller, those in Mr. Trump's orbit now confront a big-league adversary with little tolerance for what one top White House adviser once called ""alternative facts."" He leads a team of prosecutors and F.B.I. agents who are methodically and purposefully examining their words and deeds. Mr. Trump's own lawyers, wary of how frequently their client engages in falsehoods, are trying to hold the special counsel at bay. Jay Sekulow, one of the president's lawyers, has already been forced to pull back his own public remarks about an issue of concern to Mr. Mueller. In a confidential memo to the special counsel,  Mr. Trump's legal team admitted that the president, not his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., drafted a misleading statement about a Trump Tower meeting in 2016 between a Kremlin-tied lawyer and campaign officials. That statement could figure in the special counsel's scrutiny of whether the president obstructed justice. Fearful of more deceptions, the president's legal team has insisted that Mr. Trump answer questions only in writing. They delivered replies to some of the special counsel's queries on Nov. 20 after months of negotiation. If unsatisfied, Mr. Mueller could try to subpoena the president to testify. But the new acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, a vocal critic of Mr. Mueller's inquiry who now supervises it, would have to sign off. And even if he did, the White House could still mount a legal battle to quash it. Many witnesses or subjects of the inquiry lack the president's negotiating power or resources. Some have been stunned by their encounters with prosecutors, who arrive armed with thick binders documenting their text messages, emails and whereabouts on any given date. Sam Nunberg, a former longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, said he feared that the special counsel was creating the impression of a wide-ranging conspiracy among liars, when witnesses could have dispelled much of the suspicion simply by testifying truthfully. ""People are conspiring against themselves, and they are playing right into Mueller's hands,"" he said. ""If Flynn had said he discussed sanctions, he could very well be national security adviser today,"" he added. Instead, Mr. Flynn awaits sentencing for lying to F.B.I. agents about various matters, including his talks with the Russian ambassador over whether the new administration would lift sanctions against Russia. The reasons for the lies vary, but, not surprisingly, people were most often trying to protect themselves. Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump's longtime fixer, said in federal court this past week that he had misled Congress about the details of a Trump hotel project in Moscow because he did not want to contradict the president's own false characterizations of his business dealings in Moscow. He specifically cited his loyalty to Mr. Trump, referred to as ""Individual 1"" in court papers, as the reason for his crime. ""I made these misstatements to be consistent with Individual 1's political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual 1,"" Mr. Cohen told a judge. In a sentencing memo filed late Friday, Mr. Cohen emphasized that in the weeks before he misled Congress about the deal, he remained in ""close and regular contact with White House-based staff,"" as well as with Mr. Trump's lawyers. While the Moscow hotel was never built, Mr. Cohen's court filing suggested that Mr. Trump at best minimized his knowledge of the proposed venture, both as a candidate and once he had been elected. Nearly two dozen times, Mr. Trump has publicly insisted that he had no business dealings in Russia. But Mr. Cohen, who discussed the hotel project with the aide to a key Kremlin official in early 2016, said in Friday's court filing that he kept Mr. Trump apprised of negotiations that continued through June of that year, just before Mr. Trump formally became the Republican nominee. Mr. Manafort is accused of lying on top of lying. As part of a September plea deal, he acknowledged that he had lied to the Justice Department about his business dealings and that he had also tried to persuade witnesses to lie to investigators on his behalf. On Monday, prosecutors said that he continued to lie after he had agreed to cooperate with them, breaching his plea deal. His lawyers insist he told the truth. Mr. Trump has been Mr. Mueller's most vociferous critic, accusing his team of manufacturing lies by threatening witnesses with severe consequences if they refuse to agree with the special counsel's narrative. What prosecutors have called lies, Mr. Trump has insisted is truth. What they called truth, he has framed as lies. Where all this is headed is unclear, but it appears that more allegations of lying are ahead. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which has also been investigating Russia's interference in the election, has referred other cases to the special counsel's office involving witnesses who may have lied. Prosecutors are investigating whether two or more people, including a longtime friend of Mr. Trump's, Roger J. Stone Jr., lied about WikiLeaks, the rogue organization that distributed Democratic emails and other documents stolen by Russian intelligence as part of Moscow's campaign to influence the 2016 election. Mr. Mueller's team has been trying to determine whether anyone with the Trump campaign conspired with WikiLeaks or the Russian government to bolster Mr. Trump's chances of winning the White House. Jerome Corsi, a conservative author, has cast doubt on whether Mr. Stone testified truthfully to Congress about what inspired a Twitter message he posted in the summer of 2016. In it, Mr. Stone predicted, with a missing verb, ""Trust me, it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel."" Mr. Corsi said he had helped Mr. Stone concoct a ""cover story"" for the message so that it would not appear Mr. Stone had advance knowledge that WikiLeaks planned to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign by releasing emails stolen from the computer of her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. He said Mr. Stone then incorporated those falsehoods into his congressional testimony — an allegation that Mr. Stone vehemently denies. But in a turnabout, Mr. Corsi said prosecutors had now accused him of lying to them about other communications he had with Mr. Stone regarding WikiLeaks. He claims his only crime is a faulty memory."
News,2018-12-01,"LONDON — Only a few months ago, the world’s fortunes appeared increasingly robust. For the first time since the wealth-destroying agony of the global financial crisis, every major economy was growing in unison.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/01/business/global-economy-growth.html,1501," LONDON — Only a few months ago, the world's fortunes appeared increasingly robust. For the first time since the wealth-destroying agony of the global financial crisis, every major economy was growing in unison. So much for all that. The global economy is now palpably weakening, even as most countries are still grappling with the damage from that last downturn. Many nations are mired in stagnation or sliding that way. Oil prices are falling and factory orders are diminishing, reflecting slackening demand for goods. Companies are warning of disappointing profits, sending stock markets into a frenetic bout of selling that reinforces the slowdown. Germany and Japan have both contracted in recent months. China is slowing more than experts anticipated. Even the United States, the world's largest economy, and oft-trumpeted standout performer, is expected to decelerate next year as the stimulative effects of President Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cut wear off, leaving huge public debts. The reasons for this turn run from rising interest rates delivered by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to the unfolding trade war unleashed by the Trump administration. The likelihood that Britain's torturous exit from the European Union will damage trade across the English Channel has discouraged investment. None of this amounts to a screaming emergency, or even a pronounced drop in commercial activity. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank run by the world's most advanced nations, recently concluded that the global economy would expand by 3.5 percent next year, down from 3.7 percent this year. Yet in declaring that ""the global expansion has peaked,"" the brains at the O.E.C.D. effectively concluded that the current situation is as good as it gets before the next pause or downturn. If this is indeed the high-water mark of global prosperity, that is likely to come as a shock to the tens of millions of people who have yet to recover from the devastation of the Great Recession. Though the slowdown appears mild, it also holds the potential to intensify the widespread sense of grievance roiling many societies, contributing to the embrace of populists with autocratic impulses. In an age of lamentation over economic injustice, and with political movements on the march decrying immigrants as threats, weaker growth is likely to spur more conflict. Slower growth is not going to make anyone feel more secure about the prospect of robots replacing human hands, or jobs shifting to lower-wage lands. ""It's just going to exacerbate the tensions that have led to the socioeconomic and political problems we have seen in the United States and parts of Europe,"" said Thomas A. Bernes, an economist at the Center for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian research institution. ""Inequality is going to become even more pronounced."" In Greece, Spain and Italy, the youth unemployment rate is stuck above 30 percent. In Britain, the typical worker has not seen a pay raise in more than a decade, after accounting for inflation. South Africa's economy is smaller today than it was in 2010, and now the country is ensnared in recession. In the United States, the unemployment rate has plunged to 3.7 percent, its lowest level since 1969. Yet so many people have given up looking for work that less than two-thirds of the working age population was employed as of October, according to the Labor Department. That was a lower share than before the 2008 financial crisis. ""We see a lost generation,"" said Swati Dhingra, an economist at the London School of Economics. ""There was already wage stagnation and productivity stagnation. The trade war has exacerbated all of that."" The biggest risk to global growth appears to be that the trade war is, at least in part, working as designed. Although the United States and China agreed on Saturday to further trade talks, Mr. Trump has excoriated China as a mortal threat to American livelihoods, accusing Beijing of subsidizing exports and stealing intellectual property. He has affixed tariffs on some $250 billion in Chinese exports in an effort to pressure Beijing to change its ways. This has produced little change in China's economic practices. It has actually increased the American trade deficit with China, contrary to Mr. Trump's stated aim. But it has thrown sand in the gears of China's industrial juggernaut. As of September, China's rail freight usage, bank lending and electrical consumption had increased about 9 percent compared with the previous year, down from a pace of more than 11 percent in January. China's growth was already slowing as its leaders seek to transition from an economy powered by prodigious exports, in enterprises that have spewed pollution, toward a cleaner future propelled by domestic consumption. But the American tariffs have prompted multinational companies to shift orders from Chinese factories to plants in other lands, from Vietnam to Mexico. Uncertainty over the future has postponed some business. ""There's now potential for bad news on the trade front to trigger shifts in equity markets and a pullback on investment,"" said Steven J. Davis, an international business expert at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Given that China is the world's second largest economy, the consequences of its slowing ripple out widely, helping explain a pronounced drop in factory orders in Germany. American farmers have suffered lost sales as China has responded to tariffs by slapping duties on imports from the United States, not least on soybeans. Stock markets and oil prices have plunged in part on fears that China will buy fewer goods. Much of the dip in American share prices reflects the increasingly embattled state of major technology companies like Facebook, which has drawn public ire for failing to prevent its platform from serving as a primary conduit for hate speech and misinformation. But technology shares have also plunged because many companies, Apple among them, now depend on China for enormous volumes of sales — sales now at risk in the face of the trade war. A glance at Mr. Trump's Twitter feed reveals that share prices are one of the data points he cares about deeply. As the markets recoil, the Trump administration has flashed signals that it may be prepared to entertain a cease-fire with China to limit economic damage. But the conflict goes far beyond trade, with hawks inside the Trump administration seeking to inflict harm on China to impede its continued ascent as a global superpower. If that is the mission, Mr. Trump may be willing to absorb economic costs as the price of containment. That take appears consistent with Mr. Trump's growing fixation on the Federal Reserve, which the president just branded ""a much bigger problem than China,"" in an interview with The Washington Post. In lifting interest rates, the American central bank has been acting under the accepted wisdom that too much easy money sloshing around for too long tends to produce trouble, from higher prices to financial mischief. Yet the effect of raising rates is to limit American economic growth, hence Mr. Trump's unhappiness. The Fed's action has also visited distress on emerging markets. Higher American interest rates have prompted investors to abandon developing economies in favor of safer, more-rewarding opportunities in the United States. The changing of the tide has contributed to crises in Turkey and Argentina, while denting the value of currencies and slowing growth prospects from India to South Africa. The European Central Bank has also been withdrawing the cheap money it unleashed to attack the crisis, phasing out purchases of bonds. This has made credit more expensive across the continent, depriving businesses of capital needed to finance expansions. And that has muted once-hopeful talk that Europe had finally transcended the torpor of the last decade. A populist government in Italy is engaged in a standoff with European authorities over its spending plans, which breach the union's limits on deficit spending. That has prompted investors to demand higher returns for Italian debt, further squeezing credit. Mr. Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum also appear to be cooling growth in Europe. Ditto, Britain's exit. Only last year, Spain had emerged from a veritable depression to become a leading example of Europe regaining vigor. But Spain is expected to expand by only 2.2 percent next year, down from nearly 2.6 percent in 2018, according to the O.E.C.D. The rest of the 19 countries that share the euro currency are expected to dip from an already weak 1.9 percent rate of expansion to 1.8 percent. ""It's a bit like watching a heavily overweight bird try to take off,"" said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. ""It staggers to the end of the runway and starts to take off but never really soars."" The same can be said for the global economy. It is clearly far removed from the terrifying days of the financial crisis. Yet it never really got its groove back enough to generate impressive numbers of jobs, or put meaningful pay increases in the pockets of ordinary people. And now, despite all that, leaner times are unfolding."

The two also set the stage for more painstaking negotiations to resolve deeply rooted differences over trade. The compromise, struck over a steak dinner at the Group of 20 meeting here and announced in a White House statement, was less a breakthrough than a breakdown averted. The two leaders remain far apart on basic issues of market access and trade policy, and there was no sign that either planned to back down on those. Still, the handshake deal between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, after what the White House called a ""highly successful meeting,"" pauses what was becoming a headlong race toward economic conflict. It will reassure jittery financial markets, as well as American farmers, who worried about the fallout from a prolonged trade battle. In a significant concession, Mr. Trump will postpone a plan to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent, from 10 percent, on Jan. 1. The Chinese agreed to an unspecified increase in their purchases of American industrial, energy and agricultural products, which Beijing hit with retaliatory tariffs after Mr. Trump targeted everything from steel to consumer electronics. The countries set an ambitious deadline of 90 days to reach a broader trade agreement, with the White House warning that if they did not come to terms by then, Mr. Trump would raise the existing tariff rate to 25 percent. ""The relationship is very special — the relationship that I have with President Xi,"" Mr. Trump told reporters as he sat across a long table from the Chinese leader before dinner was served. ""I think that is going to be a very primary reason why we'll probably end up with getting something that will be good for China and good for the United States."" Mr. Xi replied, ""Only with cooperation between us can we serve the interest of world peace and prosperity."" As the dinner ended, the Chinese and American officials applauded the two leaders. For Mr. Trump, the agreement was an upbeat end to his subdued visit to the G-20 meeting. He dodged unsavory friends, smiled through chilly encounters with allies and canceled a news conference out of respect for his predecessor, George Bush, whose death Friday was a reminder of the role that American presidents once played at these gatherings. On his second day in Buenos Aires, Mr. Trump said little about global security or diplomacy, keeping a single-minded focus on trade. That put leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in an awkward position, because Germany, as a member of the European Union, cannot negotiate by itself with the United States on trade issues. ""We have a tremendous trade imbalance, but we're going to get that straightened out,"" he said before meeting Ms. Merkel on Saturday morning. ""We all understand each other."" American and Chinese officials conducted quiet talks about a compromise over the last several weeks. But the outcome remained in doubt until the end, when Mr. Trump, flanked by his top aides, sat down with Mr. Xi and his aides to a meal of grilled sirloin and bottles of Malbec. Mr. Trump had veered from optimism to wariness about a deal, sometimes in the course of a single statement. His economic team offered sharply conflicting advice, with moderates like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin counseling compromise, while hard-liners like Peter Navarro, the White House director of trade, urged him to double down on his pressure. The moderates tried to exclude Mr. Navarro from the trip. But at the dinner in a Buenos Aires hotel, he was there at the table, seated between the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and the chief of staff, John Kelly. He leaned forward to listen to the president as he urged Mr. Xi to crack down on illicit shipments of the deadly opioid fentanyl. The White House said that Mr. Xi, in a ""humanitarian gesture,"" had agreed to designate fentanyl as a controlled substance. China was quick to portray the agreement as a concession by Mr. Trump. Wang Shouwen, the vice commerce minister, said the president had agreed to revoke his plan to raise tariffs on certain Chinese goods to 25 percent, according to Reuters. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, said, ""China is willing to expand imports according to the needs of the domestic market and the people,"" which he said would ""gradually ease the problem of trade imbalance."" Of the roughly $250 billion worth of Chinese goods targeted by tariffs, $50 billion is already taxed at 25 percent, while the remaining $200 billion is taxed at 10 percent. As part of a series of tit-for-tat moves, Mr. Trump said he would raise the tariff for all goods to 25 percent and consider imposing tariffs on an additional $267 billion worth of exports. Some experts said the forces Mr. Trump had set in motion with Beijing would be hard to restrain. The United States is demanding sweeping changes in China's trade policy, which the Communist government might find politically difficult to enact and impossible to enforce. And the 90-day deadline is exceptionally ambitious for a trade agreement that has eluded negotiators for nearly two years. ""A halt in the tariff wars will be welcome but won't alter the fundamental collision course that Trump and Xi seem to be on,"" said Daniel M. Price, a former trade adviser to President George W. Bush. The White House, he said, continued to tighten export controls and to bar Chinese high-technology firms like Huawei from American infrastructure projects. It is also lining up other countries to clamp down on the forced transfer of technology to China — all steps that will provoke Beijing. Still, Mr. Trump was a less disruptive presence at this gathering than he has been at previous ones. The G-20 members agreed on a 31-point communiqué that reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris climate accord, even as the United States reiterated its decision to pull out of it. ""All countries except the U.S. backed conclusions reaffirming the Paris Agreement and its full implementation,"" Laurence Tubiana, the former French climate negotiator and now head of the European Climate Foundation, said in a statement. The statement also expressed concern that the World Trade Organization should be reformed. The W.T.O. is a favorite target of Mr. Trump because he believes it crimps America's ability to use tariffs and allows countries like China to cheat. ""The system is currently falling short of its objectives and there is room for improvement,"" the communiqué said, in a phrase that an administration official described as a victory for Mr. Trump. The statement did not include a reference to the dangers of protectionism, which American officials said could have held it up. Two weeks ago, a feud over language on trade between China and the United States stymied the drafting of a communiqué after an economic summit meeting in Papua New Guinea — and it was never issued. By contrast, this meeting was relatively harmonious, with Mr. Bush's death eliciting expressions of condolence from Ms. Merkel and Mr. Xi, who praised his role in advancing American-Chinese relations. In 1974 and 1975, Mr. Bush headed the United States liaison office to the People's Republic of China, a forerunner of the American Embassy. By canceling his news conference, Mr. Trump avoided a platform where his freewheeling and provocative remarks could have emphasized differences with allies and adversaries alike. Instead, he struck a somber tone, praising Mr. Bush and his legacy in all his meetings. ""The fact that we lost a president who truly was a wonderful person, a wonderful man, a great man — it really puts a damper on it, to be honest with you,"" Mr. Trump said as he sat next to Ms. Merkel. He invited the chancellor to share a recollection of a visit she made to the White House with then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl, when Mr. Bush was still president. She referred to him as ""one of the fathers of the German unification,"" adding, ""we will never forget that."" Even before Mr. Bush's death, the meeting was shadowed by Mr. Trump's legal troubles back home — his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about his dealings with Russia on behalf of Mr. Trump — and by his truncated schedule in Buenos Aires. This was the kind of diplomatic conclave at which Mr. Bush, a globe-trotting foreign-policy president, would have thrived. But Mr. Trump's experience was less comfortable. He skipped meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, two strongmen he has drawn close but who have fallen into disrepute. Mr. Putin has come under criticism for a clash last week between Russian and Ukrainian naval vessels, while the C.I.A. concluded that Prince Mohammed played a role in the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October. Mr. Trump's stubborn defense of Prince Mohammed has aggravated tensions with Turkey, which shared an audio recording of the attack on Mr. Khashoggi with the director of the C.I.A., Gina Haspel, and demanded a fuller accounting from the Saudis of what happened. On Saturday, Mr. Trump met with Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but the White House closed the session to even the brief picture-taking opportunity that usually accompanies these meetings. At a dinner for the leaders on Friday night, the White House said Mr. Trump spoke informally with Mr. Putin. There were photos of the president and the first lady, Melania Trump, seated at the long table, separated from Mr. Putin by Mr. Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan."

News,2018-12-02,HARTFORD — The news struck the Connecticut faithful like a punch.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/sports/uconn-notre-dame-womens-basketball.html,1048," HARTFORD — The news struck the Connecticut faithful like a punch. Haley Jones, a 6-foot-1 wing player from Santa Cruz, Calif., who is considered the top women's basketball recruit in the country, chose Stanford over UConn on Wednesday. That followed a recent decision by another top recruit, Aliyah Boston, a 6-4 post player from Worcester, Mass., to play for South Carolina instead of the Huskies. Which followed the departure last spring of the 6-6 Azura Stevens to the W.N.B.A. with a season of eligibility remaining. Which inflamed the sting of last-second defeats to Notre Dame and Mississippi State in the past two national semifinals. These, of course, are first-world problems. No one is throwing a pity party for the Huskies. But the futile recruiting of Jones seemed to bring rare and existential alarm to UConn fans. ""I've had people tell me UConn basketball is dead,"" said Daniel Connolly, a student who is a reporter and editor for The UConn Blog. ""A certain sector of the Twitter-verse is definitely panicking."" Connolly sat along press row Wednesday night at Hartford's XL Center as the second-ranked Huskies (6-0) dismantled No. 16 DePaul. It was a final tuneup for Sunday's trip to face top-ranked Notre Dame (7-0), the defending national champion, in the sport's premier matchup. Asked about potholes along the recruiting trail, Coach Geno Auriemma answered with the mock despair of a coach who has won 11 national championships and has averaged 30-plus victories a season for more than three decades. ""What can I say?"" Auriemma said. ""It's over."" It does seem rash to predict UConn's imminent demise. Yet Auriemma and the Huskies awakened Thursday to headlines that would have been unthinkable days or even hours earlier, asking whether the recruiting setbacks meant the ""beginning of the end"" for the coach and his team. Doug Bruno, the longtime DePaul coach, urged a tapping of the brakes on doom and gloom. ""Geno's not in it to finish second,"" he said. Still, an undeniable leveling is occurring in women's college basketball. Tennessee, the winner of eight national titles, has not reached the Final Four since Pat Summitt retired in 2012 with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. (She died in 2016.) Stanford, a two-time N.C.A.A. champion and Final Four regular, no longer dominates the Pacific-12 Conference and won its last title in 1992. Buffalo and Central Michigan, both 11 seeds, reached the regional semifinals in the 2018 tournament. UConn would surprise no one by winning its 12th N.C.A.A. title this season. But the Huskies have lost the sheen of invincibility, especially to Notre Dame, which played the Huskies, its fiercest rival, as many as four times a season when they both belonged to the Big East Conference. ""You have to believe you can win, and I think that starts with me,"" Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw said Friday. ""Some people are intimidated by their name, by what they've accomplished. And we're not."" Parity creeps like ivy. Dawn Staley coached South Carolina to its first N.C.A.A. title in 2017. And Notre Dame won its second title this spring, 17 years after its first. ""You can feel good that we've had two different winners the last two years,"" McGraw said. ""I think it's really good for the game. It brings more excitement."" Auriemma understands as acutely as anyone that UConn's dominance has a sell-by date. He has the arc of history as confirmation. In the first 35 years of the men's N.C.A.A. tournament, U.C.L.A. won 10 championships, but it has won only one since 1975. In the first 35 years of the women's N.C.A.A. tournament, UConn won 11 titles, the most recent in 2016. How will the future play out? Well, Auriemma is 64. Whenever he leaves, almost no one expects the Huskies to remain a major force if they stay in a middling league like the American Athletic Conference, trying to remain competitive against the financial resources and verdant campuses of the Southeastern Conference, the Pac-12, the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big Ten and the Big 12. Enjoy UConn's success, Auriemma admonished Huskies fans last season, because ""this isn't going to last forever."" The recent blip only reinforces how difficult it is to stay on top, Auriemma said. Since the women's N.C.A.A. tournament began in 1982, only three schools have won consecutive titles: Southern Cal, Tennessee and UConn. ""So you go through some cycles; you're supposed to,"" Auriemma said. ""Every single team in America in the last 25 years has gone through some cycle where they've not been good, except us. So how do you explain that? And the more you do that, the more it's out there that it's supposed to last forever."" Recruiting has grown more complicated. Auriemma prefers to be viewed as an instructor, not as a friend, to his players. But many of today's recruits, McGraw said, talk of building relationships with their college coaches. ""They had that in high school,"" she said. ""They are looking to be wooed a little bit more. You're seeing more and more kids, and parents, that love the attention."" Staley of South Carolina, who just signed four of the 13 top-rated high school stars, told The State newspaper about the full-court press that her assistant coaches applied to those recruits, ""talking to every single person that's involved in their lives."" In Auriemma's view, recruiting has become ""too corporate; too many people involved in the process."" But he also remains convinced that he will stock UConn's roster next season with top-shelf talent, perhaps including graduate transfers and international players. ""I'm not worried about that,"" he said. This period of uncertainty — and the chance that it is temporary — reminds Auriemma of a stretch after Diana Taurasi had left for the W.N.B.A. in 2004. With her, the Huskies won three consecutive N.C.A.A. titles. Without her, they did not win another national championship for four consecutive seasons. ""I read that the program is done, it's over,"" Auriemma said. Except it wasn't. Maya Moore arrived and UConn won championships in 2009 and 2010. Then Breanna Stewart led the Huskies to four consecutive titles from 2013 through 2016. Winning streaks seemed boundless. ""We fell on hard times,"" Auriemma said with familiar snark. ""It was like we went through a deep depression. We should have won 200 in a row; we only won 111."""

In 2013, their paths crossed at a hostel in Kuala Lumpur that is known for its rooftop bar and party atmosphere. She was on her way to Nepal for a hiking trip, and he was headed to Bali to celebrate his birthday. He told her he was from Cincinnati. She told him that she taught English to schoolchildren in Taipei. ""We had things in common — we're both originally from Long Island, we have similar world views, we're outward looking and really progressive, we like minimalist living, and are interested in politics,"" she said, noting that the two stayed up until 3 or 4 in the morning talking. ""There was just something about him that reminded me of New York, and of home."" The two commenced a friendship through Facebook messages, and some weeks later, when she was back in Taipei, he suggested that he might visit Taiwan for a week or so. ""I was staying in a hostel for maybe five or six days,"" he said, ""and the assumption was that maybe I'd be staying in Taipei for a week or two. Ten days later or so, I moved into her apartment.""

""There were no vanity photos or Kurt Vonnegut quotes. Instead he talked about his love of volunteering, which drew me to him."" ""He seemed down-to-earth and thoughtful,"" she added, ""without trying too hard to impress."" Mr. Zielinski was immediately attracted to a picture of Ms. Lowery standing in front of the United States Capitol at the 2017 Women's March. ""I could tell that she was strong and independent,"" he said. On their first date, at a professional soccer game in Indianapolis, Mr. Zielinski playfully said to Ms. Lowery that if the game had been rained out, he was prepared to impress her with his knowledge of 19th-century feminists. ""At the end of that date, I texted my brother that I had just met my wife,"" Mr. Zielinski said. ""We got along so naturally, I didn't have to try and be anyone else around her but myself."" They began seeing each other as often as possible, and despite a stark difference in personalities — ""she is outgoing and tends to be dramatic,"" he said, while ""he is more the quiet and analytical type,"" she said — they found those differences to be complementary. Within three weeks, they had exchanged ""I love yous,"" and within three months, they were so convinced they had a future together that they began shopping for wedding rings. Read more.

But he fought his way to another life. He earned three degrees, including a doctorate in education from Harvard, before starting a nonprofit in his Texas hometown. Mr. Sanchez has built an empire on the back of a crisis. His organization, Southwest Key Programs, now houses more migrant children than any other in the nation. Casting himself as a social-justice warrior, he calls himself El Presidente, a title inscribed outside his office and on the government contracts that helped make him rich. Southwest Key has collected $1.7 billion in federal grants in the past decade, including $626 million in the past year alone. But as it has grown, tripling its revenue in three years, the organization has left a record of sloppy management and possible financial improprieties, according to dozens of interviews and an examination of documents. It has stockpiled tens of millions of taxpayer dollars with little government oversight and possibly engaged in self-dealing with top executives. Showing the ambition that brought him from the barrio to the Ivy League, Mr. Sanchez seized the chance to expand his nonprofit when thousands more unaccompanied children began crossing the border during the Obama era. When the Trump administration needed to house migrant children it had separated from their parents, Mr. Sanchez took them in. As immigration intensifies as a flash point of the Trump presidency, with tear gas being fired at a migrant caravan and the price tag for separating families continuing to rise, Mr. Sanchez is central to the administration's plans. Southwest Key can now house up to 5,000 children in its 24 shelters, including a converted Walmart Supercenter that has drawn criticism as a warehouse for youths. The system is nearing a breaking point, with a record 14,000 minors at about 100 sites — a human crisis, but also a moneymaking opportunity. Though Southwest Key is, on paper, a charity, no one has benefited more than Mr. Sanchez, now 71. Serving as chief executive, he was paid $1.5 million last year — more than twice what his counterpart at the far larger American Red Cross made.

El Paso Texas Houston San Antonio Shelter Capacity 1,000 100 Brownsville Former Walmart Capacity 1,410 Arizona Phoenix Tucson San Francisco California San Diego Source: Shelter capacity numbers from officials in Arizona, California and Texas | By The New York Times Southwest Key has created a web of for-profit companies — construction, maintenance, food services and even a florist — that has funneled money back to the charity through high management fees and helps it circumvent government limits on executive pay. The organization, sitting on $61 million in cash as of last fall, has lent millions of dollars to real estate developers, acting more like a bank than a traditional charity. It has opted to rent shelters rather than buy them, an unusual practice that has proved lucrative for shelter owners — who include Mr. Sanchez and the charity's chief financial officer. Marcus Owens, the former head of tax-exempt organizations for the Internal Revenue Service under both Republican and Democratic administrations, reviewed Southwest Key's tax returns for The New York Times. Regulators, he said, seemed to be ""asleep at the switch."" Describing the financial dealings of Mr. Sanchez and his colleagues, he said, ""I think the word is 'profiteering.'"" Mr. Sanchez defended his charity. It had to move fast at times, he said in an interview. But every act, he added, has been to help children. ""There are all these kids, they're at the border, they're in detention,"" Mr. Sanchez said. ""How do we get this thing done as quickly as we can so we can start serving those kids?"" Jeff Eller, a spokesman for Southwest Key, said on Tuesday that the charity was closely examining its management practices after questioning from The Times, and that there was ""general acceptance"" that the charity had made mistakes. ""Could we have done things better? Yeah. And should have? Yeah,"" Mr. Eller said. ""But there wasn't a desire to game the system."" Because of the substantial growth of migrant shelters, the federal government hired an accounting firm this year to review shelter grant recipients, said Mark Weber, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services. He added that the department's Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees migrant shelters, had also created a new division to monitor shelters' spending. Separately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into another shelter provider, International Educational Services, for possible misuse of federal money, according to two people informed of the inquiry. The nonprofit's founder, Ruben Gallegos, said he had no comment on the investigation. Mr. Gallegos's charity — which Mr. Sanchez helped create but cut ties with years ago — lost its federal contracts in February for renting shelters owned by charity officials and paying those officials well above the government salary cap from migrant-shelter grants. Last year, Southwest Key paid eight people more than the federal salary cap of $187,000. In addition to Mr. Sanchez, they included his wife, Jennifer Sanchez, who earned $500,000 as a vice president, and Melody Chung, the chief financial officer, who was paid $1 million. Robert Carey, a director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement under the Obama administration, said he found the salaries ""appalling."" He acknowledged that his office was focused on providing adequate care for the children and had not examined Southwest Key's finances. ""When you think of how those funds could be used and should be used,"" he said, ""it doesn't sit well."" Mr. Eller said the charity had not done anything improper, adding that the federal government had prohibited the organization from discussing executive pay. In recent months, Southwest Key has come under scrutiny after a series of abuse allegations. In July, a worker at a Phoenix shelter was accused of molesting a teenage girl. In September, an H.I.V.-positive worker was convicted of sexually abusing seven teenage boys at another Arizona shelter. Southwest Key, which has relied on temporary workers to staff facilities as it has ratcheted up operations, then blew a deadline to submit proof of employees' background checks in Arizona. (Mr. Sanchez called the missed deadline a ""very small, minor thing."") Shortly after, the federal government temporarily shuttered a third Arizona shelter, in Youngtown, after Southwest Key staff members were accused of physically abusing three children. In a recent agreement with Arizona officials, Southwest Key was fined $73,000 and agreed to close that facility and another troubled shelter in Phoenix. Mr. Weber, the government spokesman, said there were ""numerous red flags and licensure problems"" with the two shelters. ""He likes to take chances,"" Paula Gomez, a friend of Mr. Sanchez's since childhood, said of him. ""Juan's that way — you can have a couple T's that aren't crossed and I's that aren't dotted."" For much of his life, Mr. Sanchez has seen himself as an advocate for the vulnerable, but he also is an ambitious networker who sought to fit in with the powerful. He met his first wife, Ellen, planning a protest against nonunion produce pickers; at the same time, he took up golf. His office features a portrait of Che Guevara, and his Harvard diploma. At his graduation ceremony, he wore a serape instead of a cap and gown. ""It was just to make a statement that Latinos were here,"" he said. Mr. Sanchez was ultimately accepted into influential circles: He joined the board of the nation's largest Hispanic advocacy group, now known as UnidosUS. The Mexican government gave him its highest humanitarian award. He rounded up politicians to speak at Southwest Key celebrations and cultivated ties to government agencies. Growing up in Brownsville, Tex., Mr. Sanchez and his four younger brothers had slept on the living room floor. Their father, a baggage carrier for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, suffered a heart attack driving Juan to his part-time job when he was 14. Juan grabbed the wheel of the car. His father died almost immediately. Juan earned money for his family any way he could: selling newspapers, picking fruit alongside migrants from Mexico. He also became a fighter, a top flyweight — at 5-foot-6 and 110 pounds — in state boxing tournaments. He thought he might become a professional boxer; if not, a priest. His high school counselor thought he might make a good mechanic. Some of Juan's friends, who had dreamed of becoming football quarterbacks and scientists, started to get in trouble. They ended up in juvenile halls, in jail, or worse. But he became the first in his family to go past high school, attending seminary before deciding against the priesthood. He graduated from college in San Antonio, earned a master's degree at the University of Washington and his doctorate at Harvard. In 1981, Mr. Sanchez, then 33, returned to Brownsville to run the Esperanza Home for Boys, a charity that housed juvenile delinquents. Six years later, he started his own charity to help children stay out of prison. He said he wanted to help kids like those he had known growing up. ""Southwest Key was, in essence, started to help my friends,"" Mr. Sanchez recalled. In its first year, the charity raised about $200,000 from a state grant to care for 21 juveniles on parole. Mr. Sanchez's salary was $35,000. Southwest Key took out loans of $6,700 to buy a Konica copier and an IBM computer. Early employees described a sense of mission and camaraderie. But it was clear who was in charge. ""Juan is very intense,"" recalled Angela Luck, the former deputy executive director. ""He can have a temper. He does have a huge work ethic and expects everybody to have the same one. He can also be funny and kind and intelligent. But it was not an easy gig working for him."" In the late 1980s, a court settlement meant for the first time that migrant children were required to have their own shelters. The federal government asked if Mr. Sanchez could take in migrant children, he said. Instead, he helped his former gym teacher and an Esperanza board member, Mr. Gallegos, establish a nonprofit to house migrants in Brownsville — International Educational Services, the organization now under federal investigation. It was not until 1996 that Southwest Key entered the shelter business, opening facilities in Coolidge, Ariz., and El Paso, Tex. That year, it pulled in $12.2 million, about $2.5 million more than the year before. ""I was all for it,"" recalled Ofelia de los Santos, a former board member. ""The money was so good, and there were so few programs like ours who knew how to run residential programs."" Mr. Sanchez made little distinction between his professional and personal life, rewarding people he liked. He stacked his board of directors with longtime friends and served on it himself, a potential conflict of interest. After his first marriage ended, he met his future wife, Jennifer Nelson, who was running a tiny nonprofit in Brooklyn. Southwest Key, by then based in Austin, took it over and hired her. Eventually, Mr. Sanchez's daughter and brother-in-law would join his charity empire. Mr. Sanchez also hired a childhood friend, Mera Champion, previously Southwest Key's banker. Even after she was convicted of embezzling $5,300 from her bank, he kept her on. ""He founded Southwest Key, and in his mind, he owns it,"" said Arjelia Gomez, the charity's former chief operating officer. ""I always had a problem with that."" The lines grew blurry at times between the charity's interests and his own. Ms. Chung, Southwest Key's chief financial officer, introduced Mr. Sanchez to a friend, Ruth Hsu, a real estate broker. In 2005, she formed a limited partnership, Conroe CHS. Hers was the only name on the documents. But Ms. Chung and Mr. Sanchez were silent partners. Conroe CHS (for Chung, Hsu and Sanchez) paid almost $950,000 for former boarding school dormitories and neighboring land in Conroe, Tex., near Houston, leasing the site to Southwest Key as its eighth shelter. Since then, the charity has paid the partners almost $3 million in rent, including about $275,000 last year. Charities are not supposed to make deals that excessively benefit leaders, and shelter grant recipients are prohibited from pursuing their ""private financial gain,"" and even the appearance of it, according to government rules. Mr. Sanchez said the government knew of his ownership of the Conroe shelter and was ""O.K. with us doing that."" Mr. Eller, the charity's spokesman, also said that the Southwest Key board had been told, and that the rent was low compared with other shelters. At least one board member, Ms. de los Santos, said she was never informed about the arrangement. Mr. Weber, the government spokesman, declined to comment specifically on Conroe, but said that the outside accounting firm was reviewing all shelter leases and that their findings would ""inform future program decisions."" Two days after The Times asked Mr. Sanchez about his ownership of the shelter, Southwest Key disclosed it publicly. A few weeks later, Southwest Key said Mr. Sanchez and Ms. Chung would seek to sell their stakes. Ms. Hsu purchased another shelter near Brownsville in 2012 to rent to Southwest Key — using the charity's address instead of her own on the deed. Ms. Chung and Mr. Sanchez joined her in buying almost 475 acres of undeveloped land near Troy, Tex., as an investment. The charity also put an undisclosed sum into the deal, mixing its money with that of the executives. Mr. Sanchez and his wife built a real estate portfolio of six residential properties with the help of Ms. Hsu, under a company called Sueños Grandes Properties, or Big Dreams. Ms. Hsu's company also donated to Southwest Key's new headquarters in Austin. To raise money for the building, Mr. Sanchez hustled like a door-to-door salesman, forging new connections and leveraging old ones. He persuaded a local philanthropist to donate land. He was friendly with Austin's first Latino mayor, Gus Garcia, as he pushed for city approval. He boasted of his credentials and promised jobs at the local branch of the federal Economic Development Administration. ""He was way out of the barrio,"" said Pedro Ruiz Garza, then the federal agency's regional director, who signed off on $4 million in grants to Southwest Key. ""I don't know how it is that he found his way to Harvard. That was very impressive."" The new three-story glass building had a slide from the third floor to the second, showing the kind of corporate whimsy common in Silicon Valley. Everyone got a thank-you. Mr. Garcia was named to Southwest Key's board. Ms. Hsu's company was recognized on a plaque in the lobby. When Southwest Key opened a 275-foot ""walk of heroes,"" with mosaics of people considered important to the charity, the first was Mr. Garza, the federal official. The second was the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In 2013, Mr. Sanchez took a ""Juan Across America"" tour, highlighting Southwest Key's 25th anniversary. In a YouTube video, he arrived at a new San Antonio shelter. As ""Hail to the Chief"" played, Mr. Sanchez bowed; staff members applauded. ""El Presidente's in town,"" announced the video. At 65, he was nowhere near retirement. The shelter industry was poised to explode. Tens of thousands of migrant children began crossing the border without family members, more than ever before. Southwest Key, with its 15 shelters, became one-stop shopping for new beds. The government needed Southwest Key and Mr. Sanchez's can-do attitude; he and his team worked closely with Obama officials to set up shelters. ""There were just kids all over the place,"" Mr. Sanchez recalled. ""The federal government got embarrassed."" Southwest Key opened eight shelters in 2013 and 2014. These were no longer small group homes, the kind envisioned by advocates. They were large institutions, with room for 236, 300, even 420 children. ""It clearly had gone through enormous growth, and I think some of the growth was without a lot of scrutiny,"" said Mr. Carey, appointed head of the Office of Refugee Resettlement in April 2015. Conservative critics said Southwest Key wasted taxpayer dollars and coddled illegal immigrants. In 2014, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, criticized the charity for requesting $316 per child per day from the federal government for a California shelter that had an organic garden and a petting farm with miniature ponies. As the shelters multiplied, so did executive pay. Mr. Sanchez earned $279,000 in 2012, and $682,000 in 2015. His wife earned $123,000 in 2012, and $275,000 in 2015. Budgets and shelter costs, not executive compensation, were the administration's focus. ""Salaries at the top and salaries of individuals in the organization were not something that I was looking at,"" said Mark Greenberg, then acting head of the agency overseeing the Office of Refugee Resettlement. One reason the charity could pay so much was that it had diversified, operating for-profit companies and charter schools. Mr. Sanchez, who had stepped down from the Southwest Key board in 2007, opted to sit on the boards of the for-profits and the charters. A holding company, Southwest Key Enterprises, oversaw eight for-profits, including those providing construction, maintenance and food services. These aimed to create jobs and earn money for the charity through outside work. But they largely subsisted on government grants and contracts with Southwest Key for work at the charter schools and headquarters. The charity also lent out employees to do work for the for-profits, charging the companies hundreds of thousands of dollars in management fees. Regulating businesses can be tricky for a charity, especially when their major customer is the nonprofit itself and competitive bids are few. Ms. de los Santos, a lawyer, left the charity's board around the time the companies began operating. ""There would be more headaches and liabilities, especially with the for-profits,"" she recalled. Teo Tijerina, who ran the for-profits in 2014 and 2015, said they had to charge enough to help cover the charity's overhead, making it tough to win bids for outside work. ""We would always be undercut by the small guys,"" Mr. Tijerina said. Southwest Key also set up charter schools — an elementary school on the donated land at its headquarters and a secondary school nearby. It just opened two more, in Corpus Christi and Brownsville. Martha Cotera, a school board member and friend of Mr. Sanchez, said she had grown suspicious over school spending, mostly because the board was given no choice about awarding work to Southwest Key for-profits. ""They were sold to us as economic development enterprises for the community, but I saw that as very self-serving,"" Ms. Cotera said. The businesses have charged the two Austin schools more than $4.4 million for food, maintenance and janitorial services since 2009. The charity has also charged the schools more than $6.3 million in rent and unspecified services. Around the time Ms. Cotera quit the board, Ms. Hsu, the real estate broker, joined. Southwest Key's shelters transformed the institutional landscape in towns near the Mexican border, replacing a psychiatric hospital, a nursing home, college apartments. Mr. Sanchez built the shelter operation on a network of real estate investors. Instead of buying buildings, he engaged in complex rental transactions that charity experts said raised concerns. Southwest Key asked friendly developers to buy properties to rent to the charity. Mr. Sanchez said he did not want to be stuck with empty shelters if children stopped coming. ""It's just not worth it for us to be purchasing buildings,"" he said. The investors were well rewarded. Over the past five years, a group based out of Mesa, Ariz., has earned more than $28 million in rent for properties that cost roughly $16 million. Others who benefited included a former New Mexico state cabinet secretary, a former adviser to a Mexican presidential candidate and two brothers who ran gas stations in Matamoros, Mexico. In one case, Southwest Key paid inexplicably higher rent than the prior tenant. The charity paid $117,000 a month for a building in Mesa where the previous renter, trying to sublet, had advertised a rate of $30,000 a month. The charity's most unusual relationship was with a pair of Brownsville developers, Ryad Bakalem and Rafael Chacon. Mr. Sanchez said he could not recall how he met the men, whose companies bought two former medical centers in 2012 and 2013 to rent to Southwest Key. Since then, the charity has lent almost $9 million to the developers' companies, for two shelters and a charter school. Though it isn't illegal, charities rarely lend money for real estate deals. The arrangement — with no government watchdog, no bank — can hide kickbacks or other improprieties because no outsider is monitoring whether the loans are repaid on time, and who might benefit. The biggest of those deals was the shuttered Walmart in Brownsville. Mr. Sanchez worked closely with the Obama administration to develop a shelter that could absorb an influx of children. Charity experts questioned why the nonprofit — now sitting on $61 million in cash — did not buy a former Walmart that it turned into a shelter. Instead, the charity lent millions to property developers to buy the building. With no bank or government watchdog, such an arrangement can hide kickbacks and other improprieties. 1.

Mr. Sanchez said that the nonprofit lent money to the developers because bank financing took too long, and that it also collected interest on the loans. The former superstore reopened as Casa Padre in June, capable of housing more than 1,400 children. Only a tent city built this summer in the Texas desert holds more migrants. The Walmart — where dorm-style bedrooms replaced racks of clothing — was controversial from the start, with advocates calling it unsuitable for children. Southwest Key pays $5 million a year in rent for the former Walmart. With the family separations came intense scrutiny, jeopardizing the charity's future. After Southwest Key failed to submit proof of employee background checks in September, the state of Arizona sent a letter threatening to revoke the organization's shelter licenses. It accused the charity leaders of ""an astonishingly flippant attitude."" Mr. Sanchez dismissed the letter as ""pretty dramatic,"" calling the failure to submit employee fingerprints a paperwork issue. But on Oct. 17, Mr. Sanchez donated $5,100 to the Arizona Republican Party, which controls the state's government. His wife gave another $5,100. (Their previous political donations totaled no more than $2,100, made only to Democrats and liberal causes, records show.) A week later, the state agreed to a settlement that kept most Southwest Key shelters open. Unbowed, Mr. Sanchez still wants to expand. ""We would love to be twice as big as we are,"" he said, ""because then we could serve twice as many kids as we serve now."""
News,2018-12-02,"LEIGHTON BUZZARD, England — Just after sunrise, a concrete plant located in a muddy industrial zone north of London stirs to life. Workers in orange suits and hard hats watch through a protective window as a machine presses what looks like red sand into a tray of brick-shaped blocks.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/climate/betting-on-a-new-way-to-make-concrete-that-doesnt-pollute.html,1291," LEIGHTON BUZZARD, England — Just after sunrise, a concrete plant located in a muddy industrial zone north of London stirs to life. Workers in orange suits and hard hats watch through a protective window as a machine presses what looks like red sand into a tray of brick-shaped blocks. Further along the line, other workers carefully measure these ruddy-colored blocks, pitch rejects into bins, and then adjust the machinery to correct errors. Joining the dawn patrol on this fall morning is a team from a company called Solidia Technologies. Solidia is based in Piscataway, N. J., and has financial backing from a well-known Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, as well as oil companies like BP and Total of France. These crew members, dressed in yellow protective suits to distinguish them from their local partners in orange uniforms, are visiting England to test a new technology that the company hopes will dramatically reshape the manufacturing of concrete. Solidia says it can make this ubiquitous building material cheaper and at the same time reduce carbon dioxide emissions by essentially turning them into stone. Solidia's big bet is that by tweaking the chemistry of cement, the key ingredient in these blocks and other concrete products, it can profit from helping to clean up an industry that is not only one of the largest on the planet but also one of the dirtiest. Cement plants are major league emitters of carbon dioxide, which is blamed for climate change. The technology seems to work but persuading the concrete industry to sign on is proving a painstaking and costly process. ""It's a labor of love; it is a market that is resistant to change,"" said Jan van Dokkum, a Kleiner Perkins operating partner and Solidia's chairman, who has spent a decade nurturing the company. Solidia's European collaborators, concrete giant LafargeHolcim, are intrigued enough to allocate the Americans a couple of hours plant time for a stretch of mornings — one of a series of trial runs in Britain and in North America. So far, they like what they see. ""From my perspective the chemistry works, the mix works, the process works, "" said Warren Hilton, the plant manager. Mr. Hilton said that he was especially attracted by the potential for saving money by speeding up the manufacture of the thousands of these paving blocks his plant churns out yearly. The concrete stones go into walkways, patios and the surroundings of soccer stadiums. ""if we can get the technology to work here,"" Mr. Hilton said. ""There will be a great benefit to any local concrete plant"" that uses it. To date, much of the focus in combating global warming has been on the electric power industry, where huge investments have been made in clean energy sources like wind and solar. Experts, though, say other major carbon dioxide sources like manufacturing industries, responsible for about a quarter of emissions, will also need to be tackled if the world is to rein in climate change. Cement ranks near the top of this list. Cement is the glue that binds together sand and gravel to form concrete, a material used to build everything from roads, to homes, to water and sewage systems. It forms about 15 percent of the content of these blocks. Because of the high heat and large amounts of energy needed as well as the chemical processes involved, making conventional or Portland cement — a process which requires high temperature kilns — produces as much as 7 percent of total global CO2 emissions. On a ton for ton basis, cement plants spew more carbon dioxide than any other manufacturing process, according to the International Energy Agency. Taking on cement making is ""quite key from a decarbonization perspective,"" said Araceli Fernandez Pales, a senior energy technology analyst at the agency, which is based in Paris. Solidia claims it can reduce as much as 70 percent of that pollution by using different chemical formulas and smarter procedures to make cement. Ordinarily, for instance, concrete is cured or hardened in a reaction using water and steam. Solidia uses carbon dioxide instead. At the end of the production line at the concrete plant, a fork lift operator stacks the trays of paving blocks like baked bread in what look like shipping containers. Carbon dioxide, collected from the flues of industrial plants, is pumped in from a nearby tank in amounts regulated by a system using sensors and computer software. Through a chemical reaction the CO2 is incorporated in synthetic limestone instead of being released into the atmosphere. The Solidia blocks are ready for use in 24 hours — a big potential advantage over ordinary pavers, which require a couple of weeks to harden. Experts say that Solidia's technology, which was developed at Rutgers University, in New Brunswick, N.J., is promising. ""There is absolutely no reason it should not work,"" said Tom Hills, a specialist on new cements at Imperial College in London. If Solidia's concrete-making technology succeeds in gaining traction around the world, it could be a way of binding up large quantities of carbon dioxide in roads and other structures. That potential is attractive to oil companies looking for ways to reduce the greenhouse gases their activities produce. BP, for instance, has invested $10 million in Solidia. The company says it wants to use the technologies ""near our operating facilities where we could take CO₂ generated and turn it into something material and productive,"" according to David Nicholas, a company spokesman. Winning over the cement and concrete industry will be tough for Solidia and other companies with alternatives to traditional products, Mr. Hills said. Solidia executives complain that the building industry is resistant to change, but the hesitation to adopt newer technologies is understandable. ""If you want to build something that lasts 50 or 60 years, "" said Mr. Hills, who also works as a research engineer at a technology company called Calix. ""Would they be willing to take the risk to build a building and to have it fall down?"" The trial run at Leighton Buzzard is part of a long and costly effort by Solidia to win converts, whom the company hopes will eventually license the technology. The company has spent around $100 million on R & D and trials like this one and is close to gaining the first glimmers of commercial acceptance. In the battle to gain acceptance, Solidia is starting with simple, low risk products. The blocks the company is making at the plant are ""not really a very sexy product,"" said Tom Schuler, Solidia's chief executive, but were chosen as the ""fastest way to have an impact."" The American stone and tile company EP Henry, for instance, is using Solidia's technology to make and sell pavers for walkways, patios and driveways. In other words, if a block breaks on the patio, the house will not fall down. Applications like reinforced concrete or mix poured from trucks are more complicated with more complex regulation and, thus, for down the road. Solidia has also been careful to tailor its technology so that existing plants do not have to make expensive changes to adopt its manufacturing techniques. ""If you make potential customers ""do too many different things, you are going to get resistance,"" said Bo Boylan, Solidia's chief commercial officer. Mr. van Dokkum of Kleiner Perkins, who is a veteran of the renewable energy business, says, optimistically, that Solidia may now be at the stage where solar power was a decade or more ago. A relatively few early adopters and government subsidies helped solar gain acceptance until the prices of panels came down, opening the way to today's huge market. ""Once we get this transition going,"" he said. ""Then suddenly this thing will boomerang through the industry."""
briefing,2018-12-02,"Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/briefing/george-bush-g-20-russia-investigation-your-weekend-briefing.html,1318," Here are the week's top stories, and a look ahead. 1. George Bush,  who saw the nation out of the Cold War as the 41st president of the United States, died on Friday at age 94. Mr. Bush was the last president to have fought in World War II, and served in Congress, the United Nations and the C.I.A. before winning the White House. He sat in the Oval Office during a period of transition, 1989 to 1993, navigating the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union and, with a global coalition, expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait. But he failed to persuade voters that he could manage the economy, and lost re-election. His son, George W. Bush, became president in 2001, and the Republican to hold the office after him, President Trump, had a hostile relationship with the family. But he praised Mr. Bush's ""sound judgment, common sense, and unflappable leadership,"" and said he would attend his funeral. We recounted the milestones and telling objects of Mr. Bush's life, his relationship with his adopted hometown, Houston, global leaders' reactions and his last words to his son George. Have you been keeping up with the headlines? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. And here's the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles. ____ 2. World leaders cajoled, confronted and dodged each other in Buenos Aires at the Group of 20 meeting of industrialized economies, above. With a trade war escalating between the United States and China, Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping called a truce after their meeting on Saturday night. Mr. Trump agreed to hold off on new tariffs planned for Jan. 1, while Mr. Xi pledged to increase Chinese purchases of American products. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he returned to Washington, Mr. Trump also said he planned to withdraw the U.S. from the North American Free Trade Agreement. The move is intended to force House Democrats to enact a revised version of the pact despite concerns that it fails to protect American workers. On Friday, Mr. Trump signed the new deal with the leaders of Canada and Mexico — neighbors by turns ambivalent and icy toward him. Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who has been accused of ordering a dissident killed, also met extreme receptions at the G-20: The president of France appeared to confront him, while President Vladimir Putin of Russia greeted him with a laugh and a high-five. Mr. Trump, who has declared his support for Saudi Arabia and tried to befriend Russia, canceled a meeting with Mr. Putin, citing the country's naval clash last week with Ukraine. ____ 3. A Moscow Trump Tower was sought by Donald Trump far longer into the 2016 campaign than previously known, his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, admitted in federal court. Lawyers for the president said he knew about the talks, and that Mr. Trump said as much to prosecutors working for the special counsel investigating Russian interference in that election. This week Mr. Cohen, above, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the talks, saying he did so out of loyalty to the president. Mr. Cohen has been cooperating with prosecutors since August, when he pleaded guilty to financial crimes. Another associate of the president, Paul Manafort, lied to investigators in breach of his own plea deal, according to the special counsel's office. Prosecutors have not ruled out more charges against Mr. Manafort, who was convicted of financial fraud — and President Trump has not ruled out a pardon. ____ 4. General Motors announced it would idle five plants in the United States and Canada and cut about 14,000 jobs, angering President Trump and workers who blamed the company rather than Trump administration steel tariffs that have made carmaking more expensive. And Marriott International revealed that hackers had breached one of its systems and stolen the data of up to 500 million guests. Despite the grim news, the stock market rallied this week off just a few words from the chairman of the Federal Reserve: He suggested little change in interest rates. ____ 5. Mexico's new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was inaugurated on Saturday. He inherited a crisis on the United States border that will test his promise to defend the poor and his ability to deal with President Trump. Last weekend, after a peaceful march of migrants in Tijuana devolved into chaos, American agents fired tear gas at a crowd that included children (a cross-border action of questionable legality). Now, squalid conditions in Tijuana, above, where thousands of migrants have gathered, fleeing violence in Central America, threaten to create a humanitarian emergency. Mr. López Obrador will have to contend with the dire crisis there and an unpredictable neighbor to the north. ____ 6. Drug overdoses killed more than 70,000 Americans in 2017, a record. The deaths contributed to a reduction in American life expectancy over the last three years, a pattern unprecedented since World War II. The new numbers from health officials depict an addiction crisis more deadly than car crashes or gun violence. Cities like Dayton, Ohio, above, have adopted naloxone, Medicaid and other treatment tools — with signs of success. ____ 7. Mars met its newest emissary of humankind, NASA's InSight lander, which touched down on the red planet after a 300-million-mile journey. The robot will study the Martian underworld, listening for tremors — marsquakes — to help scientists understand how rocky planets formed. It sent its first photo to Earth, above. Scientists around the world cheered the landing, and reacted with alarm at another milestone: the first claim of genetically edited human babies, by a Chinese researcher, He Jiankui. Dr. He did not publish research or evidence to back up his claim, but his peers were nonetheless disturbed, calling his actions a severe ethical transgression. ""I think it's completely insane,"" one scientist said. ____ 8. On ""Saturday Night Live,"" Alec Baldwin returned to his role as President Trump, trading quips with Kate McKinnon, playing Rudy Giuliani. Asked by Baldwin how the legal defense was coming, McKinnon answered, ""Well, I'm involved, so it's not great. This might be the first time someone's lawyer pleads insanity."" Ben Stiller also stopped by to reprise his role as Michael Cohen, the president's former lawyer, who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. ____ 9. Holiday lights line the streets, carols are on the radio and blood-red trees stand in the White House: It's December, and we're ready. We looked at what's greener, real or artificial trees; made gift guides for refugees, runners and the planet; and with holiday downtime in mind, compiled a guide to the best movies and TV shows streaming this month. And, of course, we have dispatches on the White House's style, decorative and aggrieved. ____ 10. Finally, don't miss our weekend reads. This week, we traveled into an internet empire linked to a mysterious religious group; reported on the ""abuse system"" of a Louisiana school famous for sending underprivileged black students to elite colleges; and spoke with social media stars doing what the beauty industry often does not: paying attention to women with dark skin. And in case you need it, here's the Week in Good News, featuring an interview with Kristine Guillaume, above, the first black woman to lead The Harvard Crimson. For more suggestions on what to watch and listen to, may we suggest the latest small-screen recommendations from Watching and our music critics' latest playlist. Have a great week.

Speaking of bestowing gifts, it's officially the festive season, and for the rest of the year, you'll hear the incessant soundtrack of holiday music pretty much wherever you go. For shopping inspiration, consult The Times's epic gift guide. These super-sharp and pleasingly hefty Japanese nail clippers are a revelation.  Nov. 26-Dec. 2 General Motors made a jarring announcement early in the week: The company plans to idle five North American factories, cutting around 14,000 jobs. Mary T. Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, said the move would keep the company competitive in a changing auto market. But not everyone was convinced. Employees and other residents of Lordstown, Ohio, a town near one of the plants, said they felt like victims of corporate greed. In other car-trouble news: At the Tesla plant in California, African-American workers said they had experienced racial threats, demeaning assignments and more. Starwood loyalists have yet another reason to be mad. The rewards program integration with Marriott's (the two hotel companies started a long merger process in 2016) has not been going smoothly, and on Friday, Marriott announced an enormous breach of the database of its Starwood reservation system. Information about 500 million guests — including some customers' names, addresses, dates of birth, passport numbers, email addresses and phone numbers — was lifted from the company's networks. The breach was larger than the Equifax debacle last year.  Police officers, prosecutors, tax authorities and other agents descended on Deutsche Bank headquarters in Frankfurt on Thursday, as part of an investigation into whether the bank helped clients launder money in an offshore tax haven. Management board members' offices were searched the next day, dramatically raising the stakes for the bank. Deutsche Bank said it was cooperating with the authorities. It's had a lot of practice: The raid is only the latest dose of turmoil for Deutsche, which for years has seen significant executive turnover and legal settlements running into the billions. Dec. 3-9 Tech executives must be racking up points, what with all their flights from the Bay Area to Washington. Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, is the latest. He will testify there on Wednesday and is likely to hear accusations from Republican lawmakers that his company suppresses conservative-leaning news. Separately, there are reports that the White House plans to host a discussion with influential tech executives. No word on whether Sheryl Sandberg will attend. The Times reported this past week that the Facebook exec personally ordered staff to research the finances of the billionaire George Soros, a decision that profoundly backfired. OPEC is set to meet on Thursday. Most experts believe the oil-producing nations will more or less maintain the status quo for production, so your drive over the river and through the woods to grandmother's house should remain affordable. Mr. Trump hopes to push oil prices even lower, but analysts say it's probably in everyone's best interests if they stay near current levels. (Those prices are pretty good compared with a decade ago, when my driver's ed instructor predicted that I'd be paying at least $6 per gallon when I became an adult. Fortunately, he was wrong. I take the subway anyway.) Three intrepid space explorers, including one American, head to the International Space Station on Monday. Anne McClain, the American astronaut, will join a Russian and a Canadian on her first trip to space. It's been a banner month for NASA, which landed a probe on Mars last week. Elsewhere in the space space, Elon Musk's SpaceX and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic continue to make promises for manned private-sector spaceflights. Mr. Branson said his company's first mission was imminent. New Zealand barred Huawei, a Chinese tech company, from supplying hardware to Kiwi companies building the next-generation mobile data network amid rising fears that Huawei products could be used for snooping. Back in the States, the Federal Reserve raised hopes that it might be closer to ending its drive to raise interest rates, setting off a market surge last Wednesday. And financial markets in the United States will be closed this coming Wednesday to honor the memory of former President George Bush, who died late Friday at age 94. $120 million. That's the value of an exit package that Leslie Moonves may never collect from CBS, if the board decides he was fired for cause."
News,2018-12-02,A taxi driver named Roy Kim recently became the eighth professional driver to die by suicide  in New York over the last year.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/nyregion/taxi-drivers-suicide-nyc.html,849," A taxi driver named Roy Kim recently became the eighth professional driver to die by suicide in New York over the last year.  The city's taxi commissioner, Meera Joshi, has characterized the deaths as an epidemic. The stories have drawn attention to the economic despair in the industry and prompted the City Council to weigh new legislation to help taxi owners reduce their debt and to increase driver wages. Each case is different and it is difficult to know why someone decides to take their life. Most of the drivers were immigrants in their 50s and 60s, some of whom had told friends and family that they were having a difficult time making a living as Uber began to dominate the ride-hailing industry. Three of the drivers owned a taxi medallion — the aluminum plate required to drive a cab in New York that once sold for more than $1 million. It is now worth as little as $200,000. Here's what we know about Mr. Kim and the broader crisis: Mr. Kim was a 58-year-old Korean immigrant who lived in Queens. He had driven a taxi for more than four years and bought a medallion last year for about $578,000 — an occasion he celebrated by having a sushi dinner with a driver he met years ago while waiting for passengers at Kennedy International Airport. But Mr. Kim had complained to friends this year that he could not find fares. He began working more often, eventually driving seven days a week. Still, his friends were surprised by his death. ""There's no other reason but the financial aspect,"" said Kyung Ryong Kang, a friend and fellow driver who had celebrated at dinner with him last year. ""It was harder and harder to survive.""  On Nov. 5, Mr. Kim was found hanging by a belt from the doorway to his bedroom, the police said. He had an adult son who lives in South Korea. Friends have been unable to reach Mr. Kim's son.  A group of drivers recently held a vigil at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens to remember him. Mr. Kang said he misses seeing Mr. Kim at the airport taxi lot. ""He was a generous person and always bought coffee for us,"" he said.  Two other drivers who took their lives also owned taxi medallions: Nicanor Ochisor, who was from Romania, and Kenny Chow, who was from Burma. Both told friends they were worried about paying off their debt.  In February, a black-car driver named Douglas Schifter killed himself with a shotgun in front of City Hall. He had written on Facebook that Uber had flooded the streets with vehicles and complained about having to work 100 hours a week to survive.  Drivers for Uber and other car services have also raised concerns about low wages. The other drivers who died by suicide were: Fausto Luna, an Uber driver; Abdul Saleh, a taxi driver who had leased his vehicle; Danilo Castillo, a livery driver; and Alfredo Perez, a livery driver. ""This tragedy underscores the importance of finding new ways for government, the industry and lenders to work in unity to address the financial challenges that are weighing so heavily on our licensees,"" Ms. Joshi said in a statement after Mr. Kim's death.  In August, the City Council approved a cap on Uber and other ride-hail vehicles — the first major American city to do so. The Council is considering a separate set of bills that would establish a health fund for drivers and create ""driver assistance centers"" to offer mental health counseling and financial advice.  Corey Johnson, the Council speaker, said the city was also looking at options to help medallion owners saddled with massive debt, from a partial bailout to a hardship fund. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a group that represents drivers, is urging the city to work with banks and philanthropic groups to write off 20 percent of taxi owners' outstanding debt.  At the vigil for Mr. Kim, the group's leader Bhairavi Desai had a message for taxi drivers who are struggling: The city is finally addressing the problem and things will get better soon. ""We know change is coming,"" she said. After Mr. Ochisor's death, his family raised more than $30,000 to help pay off his medallion. An anonymous donor also contacted his son Gabriel Ochisor, wanting to help longtime drivers like his father. The donor sent him a batch of money orders, each worth $1,000, to deliver to 217 owners who bought their medallion before 1990 and still drive their taxi.  Mr. Ochisor is trying to reach all of the drivers to mail the gifts, which will be sent with a letter from the donor. ""Please know that your 3 decades (or more!) of service are appreciated and that my life has been made better by your having worked the streets,"" the letter says. If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources. Here's what you can do when a loved one is severely depressed.  Sangsuk Sylvia Kang contributed reporting. "

Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/briefing/china-george-bush-priyanka-chopra.html,1397," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. What's changed and what hasn't for China and the U.S., Americans mourn George H.W. Bush and France reels from violent protests. Here's the latest: • A trade war truce, at least in the short term. Over steaks at the G-20 meeting in Argentina this weekend, President Trump and President Xi Jinping, pictured above, agreed on compromises that will pause their escalating economic conflict. Mr. Trump agreed to hold off on a major increase in tariffs on Chinese goods planned for Jan. 1. Mr. Xi agreed to increase Chinese purchases of American goods. But the handshake deal was ""less a breakthrough than a breakdown averted,"" writes our White House correspondent. The two world leaders set an ambitious 90-day timeline to reach broader trade agreements, but they remain deeply divided. China also didn't give any specifics for its side of the deal and state media quickly framed the agreement as a concession from the American president, leaving out any mention of the deadline. More from the G-20: Mr. Trump dodged unsavory friends, smiled through chilly encounters and was chased by legal troubles at home. _____ • Remembering George H.W. Bush. ""I love you, too."" Those were the last words of the 41st U.S. president, above, and they were directed at the 43rd, his son. An era ended with the death of Mr. Bush, 94, on Friday. A Republican, he was the last president to have fought in World War II. He served in Congress, the U.N. and the C.I.A before winning the White House. Though he only lasted a single term, he was a transitional figure who helped steer the country out of the Cold War. Mr. Bush will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol until Wednesday. Friends and family will gather for a memorial service on Wednesday, which Mr. Trump has designated as a national day of mourning. Mr. Bush will then be laid to rest in Texas. Read our full obituary and our analysis of how his presidency stands in direct contrast to President Trump's era. _____ • Afghanistan's generation of widows. The war in Afghanistan is disproportionately killing young men, leaving a generation of children with few or fading memories of their fathers. The loss falls heavily on tens of thousands of widows, who are expected to raise families in a country with few economic opportunities. They often must rely on their husband's relatives, who often demand that they marry the next available brother or cousin. Above, a widow sitting with her children. As the war took an even deadlier turn this year, our reporters followed several young women making the painful transition into widowhood. _____ • A missionary's death brings questions. Months before his fatal trip to a remote Indian island in the Andaman Sea, John Allen Chau was in the thick of an intensive and somewhat secretive three-week missionary training camp in a remote patch of the American Midwest. The boot camp was the culmination of Mr. Chau's yearslong personal goal of heading to North Sentinel Island, pictured above, home to perhaps the world's most isolated tribe — one that showed tremendous hostility to outsiders. Mr. Chau remained undeterred. When he arrived, the islanders shouted at him. They shot arrows. Then they killed him. His death reignited a debate about how best to protect the world's few remaining isolated groups. Should outsiders try to engage and support them? Or stay away? _____ • The global economy is slowing — oil prices are falling, many nations are mired in stagnation or heading that way and companies are warning of disappointing profits. Our European economics correspondent sees the mix as potentially intensifying the grievances that have contributed to the rise of populism around the world. Above, a factory in China. • Carlos Ghosn, the head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, remains in detention in Tokyo. On Friday, a court gave prosecutors 10 more days to assess allegations of financial misconduct. • The stolen personal data of 500 million Marriott guests has not shown up on the so-called dark web, cyber experts say, suggesting the hacking was by a state actor for espionage purposes. Here's how to double down on your digital security. • Two of the world's biggest airports — in Istanbul and Beijing — point toward a vastly expanded future of travel, where facial recognition and other technologies will help manage growing numbers of travelers. • Coming this week: Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai will testify at a congressional hearing in Washington and the oil-producing nations of OPEC will meet in Vienna. • Here's a snapshot of global markets. • The French government is considering declaring a state of emergency after a third week of violent protests against increased gasoline taxes. The demonstrations have left three people dead so far and wounded hundreds more. Above, a riot police officer in Paris. [The New York Times] • Delegates from nearly 200 nations have begun two weeks of high-stakes climate talks in Katowice, at the heart of Poland's coal region. [Reuters] • A North Korean soldier defected to South Korea by crossing the two countries' heavily armed border; defectors usually flee via China. [The New York Times] • The Israeli police recommended that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted on bribery and fraud charges, dealing another blow to his teetering government coalition. [The New York Times] • Neil deGrasse Tyson, the well-known astrophysicist, denied allegations that he had behaved inappropriately with three women, including one who accused him of raping her in 1984. Broadcasters of his show ""Cosmos"" have said they would investigate. [The New York Times] • Japan, in a bid to counter China's growing influence, is set to acquire its first aircraft carrier since World War II, a move some see as further eroding the country's postwar commitment to pacifism. [The Guardian] Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Recipe of the day: Serve a comforting stew of spiced chickpeas crisped in olive oil, then simmered in a garlicky coconut milk.* • Got allergies? Make traveling less strenuous. • Organizing a holiday party can be a hassle. Spare everyone the endless phone notifications and try these methods. • Hengdian World Studios, in the southeastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, claims to be the world's largest outdoor movie and television lot. Sprawled over 2,500 acres, its strikingly realistic and detailed sets churn out hundreds of increasingly popular historical period dramas a year. Above, a shoot in action. • In the #MeToo era, our chief film critic re-examines what movies have taught her about being a woman. ""Movies get into our bodies, making us howl and weep, while their narrative and visual patterns, their ideas and ideologies leave their imprint,"" she writes. • Insects are abundant yet inconspicuous and hard to meaningfully track, so the fear that they are disappearing has been more felt than documented. But a handful of determined investigators have found they are indeed diminishing. What would become of a world without them? The actor Priyanka Chopra and singer Nick Jonas tied the knot this weekend in the northern Indian city of Jodhpur (where your Briefings writer was born). Among the many dazzling details of the closely watched wedding was the venue: the Umaid Bhawan Palace, pictured above. Named after one of Jodhpur's kings, Maharajah Umaid Singh, the grandiose sandstone structure took 15 years to build between 1929 and 1943. Peacocks strut around its surrounding manicured gardens. Intricately carved pillars hold up its giant, jaw-dropping dome. But perhaps most remarkable is its noble origin story. It is said the palace was built as a mass relief program employing thousands of local people when the city was hit by a crippling drought. After the Indian government de-recognized India's royal families in 1971, the palace was split into three parts: the royal residence where Mr. Singh's grandson now lives, a luxury hotel and a museum. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

Op-Ed,2018-12-03,"I no longer think that anyone in America, including Donald Trump’s most loyal supporters, can afford to put off the consideration of the central question of this administration: What if Donald Trump or those closest to him were compromised by the Russians or colluded with them?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/opinion/trump-mueller-russia-investigation.html,850," I no longer think that anyone in America, including Donald Trump's most loyal supporters, can afford to put off the consideration of the central question of this administration: What if Donald Trump or those closest to him were compromised by the Russians or colluded with them? There have always been those of us on the left who viewed his presidency as compromised, asterisk-worthy if not wholly illegitimate, because of the Russian interference. A crime had been committed by Russia and Trump cheered the crime and used the loot thereof to advance his candidacy. That is clear. The Russians made repeated attempts to contact people in Trump's orbit and in some cases were able to meet with members of the team, as evidenced by the Trump Tower meeting. That is clear. Members of Trump's team were extremely interested in and eager to accept any assistance that the Russians could provide. That is clear. And since assuming office, Trump has openly attempted to obstruct justice and damage or impede the investigation into what the Russians did and whether anyone in his orbit was part of the crime. That too is clear. But for the people who support and defend Trump, this has already been absorbed and absolved. They may not like it, but they are willing to overlook it. Indeed, they are so attached to Trump that his fortunes and his fate have become synonymous with theirs. There is a spiritual linkage, a baleful bond, between the man and his minions. But what happens if the evidence that the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, uncovers reveals a direct link between Trump and the Russians? How do Trump's boosters respond? Last week, when Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the timeline and the extent of Mr. Trump's involvement in negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow, the political earth shifted. If Trump was lying to or misleading the American people about his efforts to do business in Russia while running for president and the Russians knew — and presumably had evidence — that he wasn't being completely honest and forthcoming, then he was compromised. While it is by no means clear that the Russians ever used any information that they may have had to blackmail or otherwise pressure Trump, Cohen's plea makes clear that they had the material to do just that. This brings ever more clarity to Trump's curious inclination to go soft on Russia condemnation, to take Russian President Vladimir Putin's word over that of his own intelligence agencies, and to drag his feet in acknowledging that Russia attacked our election in 2016 and may continue to do so in the future. How would Americans who support Trump now respond to evidence that Team Trump put their own personal and financial interests over the national interest? Would they break from their blind support and turn away from him and turn on him? How could they justify wearing the blinders for so long and countenancing so much? What language would they use to correct their complicity? There is a precedent in the Nixon investigation. When the evidence of wrongdoing was clear and incontrovertible, people began to peel away, tails tucked and full of shame. But that was a different time, one in which media wasn't so fractured and partisan, before the advent of social media and our current dissociable mentalities. Nixon had no propaganda arm. Trump has one. It's called Fox News. There is little daylight between the network's programming and the White House's priorities. If Trump goes down, so too does Fox, in some measure. So the network has a vested interest in defending Trump until the bitter end, and that narrative-crafting could impede an otherwise natural and normal disaffection with Trump. Furthermore, Trump does not strike me as a man amenable to contrition or one interested in the health and stability of the nation. I expect Trump to admit nothing, even if faced with proof positive of his own misconduct. There is nothing in the record to convince me otherwise. He will call the truth a lie and vice versa. I also don't think that Trump would ever voluntarily leave office as Nixon did, even if he felt impeachment was imminent. I'm not even sure that he would willingly leave if he were impeached and the Senate moved to convict, a scenario that is hard to imagine at this point. I don't think any of this gets better, even as the evidence becomes clearer. I don't believe that Trump's supporters would reverse course in the same way that Nixon's did. I don't believe that the facts Mueller presents will be considered unassailable. I don't believe Trump will go down without bringing the country down with him. In short, I don't believe we are reaching the end of a nightmare, but rather we are entering one. This will not get easier, but harder. The country is about to enter the crucible. This test of our republic is without a true comparison. And we do not have a clear picture of how the test will resolve. But, I believe damage is certain.

It was written by William B. Benton — a co-founder of the Benton & Bowles ad agency — and an editor's note explained that Benton was speaking not just for himself but on behalf of a major corporate lobbying group. The article then laid out a vision for American prosperity after World War II. At the time, almost nobody took postwar prosperity for granted. The world had just endured 15 years of depression and war. Many Americans were worried that the end of wartime production, combined with the return of job-seeking soldiers, would plunge the economy into a new slump. ""Today victory is our purpose,"" Benton wrote. ""Tomorrow our goal will be jobs, peacetime production, high living standards and opportunity."" That goal, he wrote, depended on American businesses accepting ""necessary and appropriate government regulation,"" as well as labor unions. It depended on companies not earning their profits ""at the expense of the welfare of the community."" It depended on rising wages. [Listen to ""The Argument"" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] These leftist-sounding ideas weren't based on altruism. The Great Depression and the rise of European fascism had scared American executives. Many had come to believe that unrestrained capitalism was dangerous — to everyone. The headline on Benton's article was, ""The Economics of a Free Society."" In the years that followed, corporate America largely followed this prescription. Not every executive did, of course, and management and labor still had bitter disputes. But most executives behaved as if they cared about their workers and communities. C.E.O.s accepted pay packages that today look like a pittance. Middle-class incomes rose faster in the 1950s and 1960s than incomes at the top. Imagine that: declining income inequality. And the economy — and American business — boomed during this period, just as Benton and his fellow chieftains had predicted. Things began to change in the 1970s. Facing more global competition and higher energy prices, and with Great Depression memories fading, executives became more aggressive. They decided that their sole mission was maximizing shareholder value. They fought for deregulation, reduced taxes, union-free workplaces, lower wages and much, much higher pay for themselves. They justified it all with promises of a wonderful new economic boom. That boom never arrived. Even when economic growth has been decent, as it is now, most of the bounty has flowed to the top. Median weekly earnings have grown a miserly 0.1 percent a year since 1979. The typical American family today has a lower net worth than the typical family did 20 years ago. Life expectancy, shockingly, has fallen this decade. The great stagnation of living standards is a defining problem of our time. Most families do not enjoy the ""rapidly rising level of living"" that Benton called for. Understandably, many Americans are anxious and angry. The solution will need to involve a return to higher taxes on the rich. But it's also worth thinking about pre-tax incomes — and specifically what goes on inside corporations. It's worth asking the question that Benton asked: What kind of corporate America does the rest of America need? Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, is now rolling out a platform for her almost-certain presidential campaign, and it includes an answer to this question. It is a fascinating one, because it differs from the usual Democratic agenda of progressive taxes and bigger social programs (which Warren also supports). Her idea is the most intriguing policy idea to come out of the early 2020 campaign. Warren wants an economy in which companies again invest in their workers and communities. Yet she doesn't believe it can happen organically, as it did in the 1940s, because financial markets will punish well-meaning executives who stop trying to maximize short-term profits. ""They can't go back,"" she told me recently. ""You have to do it with a rule."" She has proposed a bill in the Senate — and Ben Ray Luján, a top House Democrat, will soon offer it there — that would require corporate boards to take into account the interests of customers, employees and communities. To make sure that happens, 40 percent of a company's board seats would be elected by employees. Germany uses a version of this ""shared-governance"" model, mostly successfully. Even in today's hypercompetitive economy, German corporations earn nice profits with a philosophy that looks more like William Benton's than Gordon Gekko's. Is Warren's plan the best way to rein in corporate greed? I'm not yet sure. I want to see politicians and experts hash out her idea and others — much as they hashed out health care policy in the 2008 campaign. But I do know this: American capitalism isn't working right now. If Benton and his fellow postwar executives returned with the same ideas today, they would be branded as socialists. In truth, they were the capitalists who cared enough about the system to save it. The same goes for the new reformers. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter. "
News,2018-12-03,"GENEVA — Ten years after an international treaty banned cluster munitions, several financial institutions are slashing investment in companies that produce the weapon, according to a European organization that campaigns for a global ban.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/world/europe/firms-drop-support-for-cluster-bombs-but-global-problem-is-much-worse.html,495," GENEVA — Ten years after an international treaty banned cluster munitions, several financial institutions are slashing investment in companies that produce the weapon, according to a European organization that campaigns for a global ban. The Netherlands-based group PAX said in a report released on Monday that financial institutions it monitors had cut investment in companies that produce cluster munitions from $31 billion in 2017 to $8.7 billion in 2018 — a 72 percent decrease. Michel Uiterwaal, a co-author of the report, called the downturn a ""testament to the growing global awareness that support for this weapon is unacceptable."" But he also said that many companies not covered by the report were continuing to produce and invest in cluster munitions. ""The global problem is much worse than we describe,"" Mr. Uiterwaal said, ""because there are more producers and there's more money involved."" Cluster munitions include a wide array of bombs, rockets and artillery shells that scatter up to hundreds of smaller bomblets. Up to one-fifth of them do not detonate, leaving large expanses of land contaminated by bomblets that kill and maim civilians years after a conflict has ceased. The stigma attached to cluster munitions rose sharply with an international campaign that led to a 2008 treaty banning production, stockpiling and transfer of the weapon. The United States vigorously opposed the treaty, but 120 countries, including most NATO members, have joined the accord. The organization attributed the financial drop mostly to the decision by two major American arms manufacturers — Textron Inc. and Orbital ATK — to halt production of the weapon. Mr. Uiterwaal said those decisions at least partly reflected pressure from financial institutions that are turning their backs on funding companies that produce cluster munitions. The $8.7 billion of investment tracked by PAX went to seven companies: Avibras of Brazil, Bharat Dynamics in India, the Chinese companies China Aerospace Science and Industry and Norinco, and the South Korean companies Hanwha, LigNex1 and Poongsan. That list of producers is not exhaustive and no information is available on financing available to many other arms manufacturers producing cluster munitions, Mr. Uiterwaal said. Russia, China, India, Israel and South Korea are among states that have not joined the treaty, and the weapon has been heavily used in a number of active conflicts. United Nations investigations have reported Syrian and Russian forces using cluster munitions in the seven-year-old Syrian conflict. Human rights groups have reported the use of American, British and Brazilian-made cluster munitions by Saudi Arabia and its allies in the war in Yemen and Egypt's use of cluster bombs in the Sinai Peninsula. The United States' last known use of the weapon was in 2009. A directive issued by the George W. Bush administration the previous year said it would not use cluster bombs after 2018 unless they achieved a performance standard not met by existing stocks. Last year, however, the Pentagon reversed that commitment, arguing that cluster munitions provided ""an effective and necessary capability to engage area targets."""

Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Negotiations to start in France, a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war and the death of George Bush.  Here's the latest: • Turmoil continues in France.  The French government is considering declaring a state of emergency after a third week of violent protests against increased gasoline taxes. The demonstrations have left three people dead and hundreds more wounded. Politicians and law enforcement officials said the situation was close to an ""insurrection."" On Monday, the government will meet with representatives of the ""Yellow Vests"" protest movement and with the leaders of the opposition political parties. While the government has not signaled any intention to roll back the gas tax increase, some Yellow Vests have indicated they are ready to negotiate. Deep frustration: The anger fueling the protests in Paris has its roots in the poor rural regions of France, our Paris correspondent reports. _____ • A trade war truce, at least in the short term. Over steaks at the Group of 20 meeting in Argentina this weekend, President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, pictured above, agreed on compromises that will pause their escalating economic conflict. Mr. Trump agreed to hold off on a major increase in tariffs on Chinese goods planned for Jan. 1. Mr. Xi agreed to increase Chinese purchases of American goods. But the handshake deal was ""less a breakthrough than a breakdown averted,"" our White House correspondent writes. The two world leaders set an ambitious 90-day timeline to reach broader trade agreements, but they remain deeply divided. China also didn't give any specifics for its side of the deal, and state media quickly framed the agreement as a concession from the American president, leaving out any mention of the deadline. More from the summit: Mr. Trump dodged unsavory friends, smiled through chilly encounters and was chased by legal troubles at home. _____ • Remembering George Bush. ""I love you, too."" Those were the last words of the 41st U.S. president, above, and they were directed at the 43rd, his son. An era ended with the death of Mr. Bush, 94, on Friday. A Republican, he was the last president to have fought in World War II. He served in Congress, the U.N. and the C.I.A. before winning the White House. Though he lasted only a single term, he was a transitional figure who helped steer the country out of the Cold War. Mr. Bush will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol until Wednesday. Friends and family will gather for a memorial service on Wednesday, which Mr. Trump has designated as a national day of mourning. Mr. Bush will then be laid to rest in Texas. Mr. Bush's death has quieted a raucous political system, but the peace is unlikely to last, writes our chief White House correspondent. Read our full obituary and this remembrance by Maureen Dowd, the longtime White House correspondent, who portrays her improbable friendship with Mr. Bush as ""a screwball story."" _____ • Getting rich off detained migrant children.  As the founder and chief executive of Southwest Key, a nonprofit that houses more migrant children than any other organization in the United States, Juan Sanchez has made millions and is indispensable to the Trump administration's immigration policy. But a New York Times investigation, drawing on dozens of interviews and an examination of documents, has found a record of sloppy management and possible financial improprieties including possible self-dealing with top executives. • The global economy is slowing: Oil prices are falling, many nations are mired in stagnation or heading that way and companies are warning of disappointing profits.

It is said that the palace was built as a mass relief program employing thousands of local people when the city was hit by a crippling drought.

News,2018-12-03,The founder of an online news start-up critical of the Philippine government turned herself in to the authorities in Manila on Monday after a warrant for her arrest was issued over the weekend.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/business/media/rappler-maria-ressa-arrest.html,938," The founder of an online news start-up critical of the Philippine government turned herself in to the authorities in Manila on Monday after a warrant for her arrest was issued over the weekend. The Philippine government has accused the journalist, Maria Ressa, and her news organization, Rappler, of evading taxes, a move that Rappler said was part of a broader attack on the news media in the Philippines by the government of President Rodrigo Duterte. Ms. Ressa and Rappler were charged with five counts of tax fraud last week. The penalties could include a fine along with up to 10 years of imprisonment for Ms. Ressa. They have denied the charges. The government prepared a warrant for Ms. Ressa's arrest to coincide with her return to the Philippines on Sunday evening after a weekslong trip abroad that included appearances at several high-profile journalism awards ceremonies. In Washington, Ms. Ressa received the 2018 Knight International Journalism award. In New York, she was given the Press Freedom Award by the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""I'm going to hold my government accountable for publicly calling me a criminal,"" Ms. Ressa said in a brief conversation with a group of reporters who greeted her arrival at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila late Sunday. ""I am not a criminal."" On Monday morning, Ms. Ressa arrived at the Pasig Regional Trial Court in Manila and provided head shots for the court and had her fingerprints taken. Her legal team filed a motion for Ms. Ressa to be set free on bail and paid 60,000 pesos, or about $1,100, to secure her release, her lawyer said by phone. It is the latest in a series of crackdowns on the news media by the Duterte government. Mr. Duterte is one of a growing group of political strongmen who rode to power in recent years on a wave of populism in their countries and in the process tightened their grip on power. When challenged by the news media, these leaders have often turned on reporters, accusing them of being dishonest and manufacturing ""fake news."" In the Philippines, Mr. Duterte has waged an aggressive antidrug campaign that has led to the deaths of thousands of people. Local news organizations like Rappler closely documented the campaign, provoking international outcry over the killings and causing Mr. Duterte to turn his focus to the news media. He has threatened several times to block the license renewal for ABS-CBN, the largest broadcast network in the Philippines. He has called reporters ""spies"" and ""sons of bitches"" and made thinly veiled death threats, warning reporters that they are ""not exempted from assassination."" Rappler, founded in 2012 as a scrappy investigative and entertainment outlet, has been a main target of his verbal abuse. Its star political reporter, Pia Ranada, in particular has been singled out. At one news conference, Mr. Duterte warned her not to go to his hometown, Davao, where he was once mayor, because ""something bad will happen to you."" Earlier this year, Ms. Ranada was stripped of the press pass that allows her to cover Malacañang Palace, the Philippine equivalent to the White House. Rappler reporters have been barred from covering any official presidential events. Such treatment has alarmed media groups. ""More than his inability to tolerate dissent, Duterte's relentless persecution of the media appears to be part of the increasingly authoritarian direction his presidency has taken,"" the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said in a statement on Sunday night. Rappler's newsroom has also been on the front lines of a war against misinformation on Facebook, where most Filipinos get their news. Rappler reporters have been the targets of online death and rape threats so severe that senior editors have debated installing bulletproof windows in the news organization's office. This year, Rappler became an official fact checker for Facebook, which has called the Philippines ""Patient Zero"" in the battle over misinformation. The Philippine government's case against Ms. Ressa and Rappler was brought by the country's Department of Justice and centers on a 2015 investment in Rappler by the Omidyar Network, an American organization owned by Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay. At the heart of that case is a financial transaction that is also the subject of a Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission effort this year to revoke Rappler's license to operate. The charges treat Rappler as though it were a ""dealer in securities"" and not a news organization, Ms. Ressa said, adding that Rappler has paid the right taxes required of a news organization in the Philippines. Francis Lim, a lawyer for Ms. Ressa, said Monday in a statement sent by text message, ""The police can no longer arrest her, as the court just approved the cash bail that she has posted for her liberty during the pendency of the case."" Several politicians criticized Mr. Duterte and his administration's case against Ms. Ressa on Monday. One opposition congressman, Tom Villarin, said it was ""a sure sign that the Duterte administration wants to throw this country into obscurity and darkness,"" adding that ""harassing journalists and putting critics in jail is the refuge of fascists and scoundrels."" Risa Hontiveros, an opposition senator, called the case an attempt to ""muzzle the media into fear."" ""In his attempt to be a full-fledged authoritarian, President Duterte wants to control the free flow of information and neutralize a potential channel of criticism,"" Ms. Hontiveros said in an emailed statement. Speaking on Sunday night from the airport, Ms. Ressa said that her arrest would not silence her. ""I have been a journalist my entire life,"" she said. ""I will continue to hold the government accountable."""
News,2018-12-03,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/nyregion/port-authority-bieber-bus-evicted.html,1503," [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] A financially struggling bus company was kicked out of the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan after failing to pay $214,000 in fees. But instead of shutting down, the scofflaw company found a new home at a fraction of the cost: on the curb outside. Passengers just need to walk down the street to catch Carl R. Bieber Inc. buses to the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania. The new bus stop on Eighth Avenue, near 39th Street, was approved by city transportation officials despite the objections of residents, community leaders and others who say that it crams even more buses and people (and luggage) into one of New York's most congested corridors — and essentially rewards Bieber with a prime spot. ""If you pay for something — and then you don't pay — how do you get something better?"" said Joe Tabone, the manager of a liquor store next to Bieber's stop. ""I don't think that's fair."" Bieber's curbside spot is part of what critics say is a much larger problem: a booming fleet of private buses that roll through Manhattan and pull over on streets, making New York's already bleak traffic picture even worse. Across New York, the number of bus companies with permits for curbside stops has more than tripled since 2013, to 151 from 46. Many intercity and commuter buses rely on curbside loading and unloading of passengers not only because it is cheaper for carriers, but also because they cannot all fit in the outdated Port Authority Bus Terminal. As a result, critics say, the buses are adding to choked streets at a time when traffic in Midtown Manhattan is crawling at an average of 4.7 miles per hour, among the slowest speeds of any major American city. They also say the so-called ""curbside terminals"" have blocked sidewalks and entrances to stores and other businesses and worsened air pollution. ""It is cheaper for the bus company, but city residents, workers and visitors pay a heavy price,"" said David Sandler, 39, a member of a local community board that opposed Bieber's bus stop. Across the United States, intercity bus travel is soaring. There were an estimated 61.6 million rides in 2015, up from about 45.2 million rides in 2008, fueled by the arrival and expansion of carriers such as Megabus and BoltBus that offer low fares, wireless internet and online ticketing, according to Joseph P. Schwieterman, director of the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University. Intercity bus ridership has especially thrived in the New York City region, in part as more buses offer people a wider choice of pickup and drop-off locations and significantly lower fares than trains. The city's strong job market has also drawn long-haul commuters from Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, upstate New York and elsewhere. In 2018, there were an estimated 22 million intercity bus rides in the New York City area alone, or about a million more rides than in 2014, according to Mr. Schwieterman. Buses are ""a solution to the congestion problem"" since they offer an alternative to driving, said Peter J. Pantuso, the president and chief executive of the American Bus Association, an industry group. But, he added, cities have been slow to invest in new terminals and infrastructure as they ""have identified they have challenges, but they haven't quite figured out how to address them yet."" The Port Authority, the country's busiest bus terminal, opened in 1950 in part to help reduce congestion. Today, all 186 active passenger boarding areas — spread over three floors in two buildings — are full during peak hours. A larger terminal is planned, though it is years away. For now, 18 bus companies and New Jersey Transit share the terminal. Megabus is not one of them because its double-decker buses are too tall to fit. So passengers wait to be picked up at a bus stop on the Far West Side where there is no bathroom, food court or shelter from the cold and rain. Still, they keep coming. Since the carrier started in New York in 2008, ridership has tripled, and routes have expanded to 38 cities from six. Sean Hughes, a spokesman for Megabus, said the carrier has worked to address community concerns about congestion and idling, including offering drivers bonuses for not idling. Today, there are 118 curbside bus stops in Manhattan, according to the city, of which 66 are clustered between 14th and 59th streets in neighborhoods that are already overrun with cars. In total, the Manhattan stops are used hundreds of times a day by private buses — on a recent weekday passengers were dropped off 946 times and picked up 799 times. One bus stop, on 34th Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues, has brought constant honking as buses have idled and slowed traffic, as well as piles of trash left behind by passengers, according to Pat Forbes, a cybersecurity executive who lives across the street from the stop. ""I don't think anyone has anything against buses — it's just where they're at,"" said Mr. Forbes, 58. ""They couldn't have picked a worse area if they tried.'' Christine Berthet, a member of a Midtown Manhattan community board, said bus companies all want to be near the Port Authority and Pennsylvania Station, but sometimes can be persuaded to go farther away where there is more room. But even that is no longer the best solution. ""We have run out of spots,"" she said. Bieber buses rolled into the Port Authority in the 1970s, carrying visitors and commuters seeking high-paying jobs without the city's high cost of living. In recent years, about 450 passengers rode on weekdays, though that number has declined. Bieber's license to operate at the Port Authority was terminated on July 28, the first time that has happened in recent years, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the terminal. He said Bieber still owes about $125,000. Matthew Daus, a lawyer who represents Bieber, said the company was facing ""financial difficulties in the year leading up to the termination by the Port, and was seeking refinancing in order to keep current with the Port payments, and the refinancing was delayed."" Mr. Daus also said Bieber had to apply for a curbside spot because it could not return to the terminal and that other companies at the terminal also have outside spaces. A Port Authority official opposed the location of Bieber's stop, arguing in an October letter to the city that adding a curbside spot to the heavily congested area outside the terminal ""only complicates an already challenging environment."" It also puts bus companies paying to use the terminal at a competitive disadvantage, according to the letter. City transportation officials said they have limited authority to reject bus stops and were responsive to concerns about Bieber by issuing a permit for only three months — instead of the usual three years — so they could monitor its operations. The stop is already used by a public bus. State law caps how much can be charged in administrative fees for a bus stop: Bieber has paid $1,140. (It would be $4,560 for a full year.) Steve Haddad, the president and chief executive officer of Bieber, said in a statement that ""our company looks forward to being a good neighbor to the community and to continue serving our customers, who have no other way to get to and from New York City to earn a living."" The company, he added, has stationed a dispatcher at the stop to ensure safe and efficient operations. After leaving the terminal, Bieber buses operated on city streets without an approved bus stop, racking up violations and fines, according to The Morning Call, which has reported on the company's financial and legal troubles. Mr. Daus said many violations have been dismissed and others were being appealed or contested. Bieber buses then dropped off passengers in Weehawken, N.J., where they took a ferry across the Hudson River to Manhattan and then used other buses to continue through Midtown. ""I said I was missing one mode of transport — an airplane,"" said Esther Peña, 22, a hospital clinical research coordinator whose two-and-a-half hour one-way commute from Allentown, Pa., grew even longer, to three hours. Many passengers said Bieber should have paid its bills and that its problem became theirs because there were few other transit options. Yolanda Campbell, 32, a nurse, shivered as she waited recently on the curb for a Bieber bus. She had been driving because she did not want to follow Bieber as it moved around and other bus companies had limited routes and hours. But she would get so tired that she had to pull over to nap. ""I was falling asleep every day,"" she said about her commute from the Allentown area. ""I don't care if they're on the street as long as I don't have to drive."""

Instead, TikTok — a Chinese-made app that was known as Musical.ly until ByteDance, the Chinese internet conglomerate, acquired the company in 2017 and merged it with a video app it owned — has a simple premise. Users create short videos set to music, often lip-syncing along, dancing or acting out short skits. The app contains templates and visual effects to spice up the videos. There is also a live-streaming feature that allows users to send virtual ""gifts"" to their favorite creators, which can be bought with real money. The rest works like any other social app — followers, hashtags, likes and comments. It doesn't sound like much. But, somehow, it adds up to what might well be the only truly pleasant social network in existence. I feel comfortable making that call because I go on social networks for a living, and I have spent thousands of hours wading through an unholy slurry of Twitter spammers, Instagram scammers, teenage YouTube fascists and baby boomers whose brains have been turned to pudding by too many Facebook memes. TikTok has none of that. Instead, it's that rarest of internet creatures: a place where people can let down their guards, act silly with their friends and sample the fruits of human creativity without being barraged by abusive trolls or algorithmically amplified misinformation. It's a throwback to a time before the commercialization of internet influence, when web culture consisted mainly of harmless weirdos trying to make each other laugh. ""It's a bit of an escape,"" said Billy Mann, a TikTok creator who uses the platform to make comedy videos for his more than 650,000 followers.  ""It's a safe haven for people that are seeing the world on fire and being like, 'I need silliness,'"" he said. TikTok's earnest goofiness has turned off some skeptics. But it's hard to argue with the numbers. The app recently passed six million users in the United States, according to a report from the market research firm Sensor Tower. As of Friday, it ranked No. 4 among free apps in Apple's app store, ahead of Snapchat, Netflix and Facebook Messenger. Globally, the app, whose Chinese version is called Douyin, had 500 million monthly active users as of July, making it bigger than Twitter and about half the size of Instagram. Currently, TikTok makes money through virtual gift sales and brand collaborations, such as a Guess-sponsored ""fashion takeover."" There are no ads inside the app, although the company's privacy policy leaves room for them in the future. TikTok, which is privately held, does not disclose financial information, but Sensor Tower estimates that it took in roughly $3.5 million in October. TikTok's success has spawned legions of influencers, users with millions of followers and household-name status among teenagers. And it has propelled ByteDance, which also owns a suite of other social media and news apps, to a reported valuation of $75 billion, making it one of the most valuable start-ups in the world. TikTok's global head of marketing, Stefan Heinrich, said in a statement that the company's mission was to ""capture and present the world's creativity, knowledge and moments that matter, directly from the mobile phone."" In perhaps the clearest sign that TikTok is on to something, Facebook is trying to kill it. Last month, the company quietly released Lasso, a clunky clone that borrowed many of TikTok's core features and even tried to siphon off some of its power users. Lasso got off to a slow start, and is now the 687th most downloaded photo and video app in the United States, according to the mobile data company AppAnnie. The executive leading the Lasso team, Brady Voss, left the company shortly after the app was released. (Facebook declined to comment, and Mr. Voss did not respond to a request for comment.) Before I go any further, let's get one thing out of the way: If you're reading this, you are almost certainly too old to feel at home on TikTok. The company declined to provide information about its users, but judging from what's on the platform, the median TikTok user seems to hover in the midteens. TikTok is full of acne-studded faces, barely concealed tween angst and impenetrable youth-culture references. As far as I can tell, there is no way for adults to use it without feeling as if they are chaperoning a high school dance. Officially, TikTok users must be 13 or older to join. But the age-verification process is easy to circumvent, and while browsing the platform, I stumbled upon several videos starring people who appeared to be much younger. In its previous incarnation as Musical.ly, TikTok drew fire from some privacy advocates, who accused it of pushing the limits of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, a law that prohibits the collection of certain types of information from users younger than 13. ""It's clearly a really popular, cool site, but you also have the issue of kids being significantly too young for it,"" said James P. Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews tech products for families. ""It's not that the content on TikTok isn't O.K. for your 15-year-old. It's what happens to your 6- or 7-year-old."" While using TikTok, I never saw examples of bullying or harassment. (Both of which are prohibited by TikTok's community guidelines, as is sexually explicit content.) There are, however, a decent number of videos featuring teenage girls dancing suggestively — which, if you are a 31-year-old newspaper columnist and not a 16-year-old boy, is fairly unsettling. A TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement that promoting safety and positivity on the platform is ""our top priority."" She added, ""we periodically add to and adjust our protective measures, policies and moderation efforts to support the well-being of our users."" Last year, after two other apps owned by ByteDance were criticized by Chinese officials for promoting objectionable content, the company's chief executive, Zhang Yiming, said that it would increase the ranks of its content moderation team to 10,000 moderators, from 6,000. The TikTok spokeswoman declined to say how many of those moderators work for TikTok, or whether content standards for American users differ from those for users in China, where famously strict censorship laws apply. Free-speech advocates might bristle at TikTok's Chinese ownership, and privacy hawks have raised questions about how the company handles users' personal data. But perhaps because it is more heavily moderated than other networks, TikTok mostly feels safe and wholesome. Julia Alexander, a fellow TikTok convert at The Verge, called it ""a rare social app that isn't infested with hateful rhetoric."" One popular genre of TikTok video is the ""challenge,"" a kind of video skit that is acted out en masse. One challenge, #eatonthebeat, encouraged users to make videos of themselves chomping down on food to the beat of a song. Another challenge, #chooseyourcharacter, encouraged users to mimic a video game's character selection screen. Then there are the running jokes attached to specific songs — like ""Good Girls Bad Guys,"" a song by the band Falling in Reverse, which is used for a genre of video in which a user appears first in nerdy, unattractive clothes, and then cuts abruptly to a made-over version of himself in sunglasses, leather jackets or other bad-boy attire. Despite TikTok's teens-only vibe, some adults have started to trickle on. Jimmy Fallon, the late-night TV host, recently joined the site and started posting his own challenges. The comedian Amy Schumer recently made a TikTok video, and prominent YouTubers like Jake Paul have tested the waters. Is TikTok a Facebook killer? No, probably not. For all the variety in its videos, it is still a fairly limited app, with a more narrow appeal than more populist social platforms. But by purposely limiting its features, by resisting the temptation to monetize its users aggressively and by keeping trolls and bullies off its platform, TikTok has done something truly impressive — it has built a social network that is genuinely fun to use. There might be a lesson there."
News,2018-12-03,"FAIRBANKS, Alaska — The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the most pristine landscapes in the United States. But that may soon change as the Trump administration seeks to exploit an untapped trove of oil beneath its coastal plain. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/us/alaska-oil-drilling-takeaways.html,1023," FAIRBANKS, Alaska — The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the most pristine landscapes in the United States. But that may soon change as the Trump administration seeks to exploit an untapped trove of oil beneath its coastal plain.  Since Congress approved a measure last December to open the coastal plain to oil exploration, the Department of the Interior has been charging ahead with a plan to sell drilling leases as early as next year. Trucks weighing 90,000 pounds could begin rolling across the tundra even before then to conduct seismic tests that help pinpoint oil reserves. The hurried approach has alarmed some government specialists and environmentalists, who say that risks to wildlife and damage to the tundra are not being taken seriously enough. And it comes as the Trump administration moves more broadly to exploit fossil fuels in Alaska and beyond, erasing restrictive policies that were designed to protect the environment and address global warming.  The New York Times examined how, in the space of about a year, the refuge's coastal plain — known as the 1002 Area — went from off-limits to open for business. Here are six takeaways. In 1960, Congress set aside millions of acres of land in northeast Alaska for wildlife protection, but the discovery of oil reserves around Prudhoe Bay in 1968 suggested such riches may also exist elsewhere, including under the coastal plain. Ever since, Alaskan lawmakers have been at the forefront of a push to allow oil exploration in the plain. In 1980, Congress passed conservation legislation that left an opening for eventual oil and gas development there, but over the years opponents blocked repeated attempts by Alaskans — and Republicans — to proceed.  While Alaskans generally favor drilling in the state, a poll last year by researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities showed that 70 percent of registered voters nationwide opposed it in the reserve. There is also the question of whether additional domestic oil production is even necessary in the United States, especially in the Arctic — where it is costly to produce — as the world needs to eventually wean itself off fossil fuels. The 2016 election brought about a rare opportunity. With Republicans controlling Congress and the presidency, the opening of the refuge to oil exploration became an urgent priority for Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, and others in her party. Democrats in the Senate still had the ability to filibuster any legislation that would directly authorize drilling, so Ms. Murkowski found an end run. She engineered a provision in last December's tax overhaul bill that characterized oil exploration on the coastal plain as a way to grow federal revenues. The bill passed the Senate on a straight party-line vote. When President Trump signed it into law with much fanfare, he was also authorizing drilling in the refuge. In preparing to see through the new authorization, the Department of the Interior, which has jurisdiction over federal lands, filled key jobs with appointees who were committed to oil exploration and had deep connections to Alaska.  A former Washington lobbyist, David Bernhardt, was appointed deputy Interior secretary. In 2014, he had represented the state of Alaska when it sued the federal government over its refusal to review oil exploration plans for the refuge. Another top appointee, Joe Balash, had served as Alaska's commissioner of natural resources at the time of the lawsuit. Officials with the Interior Department pledge to conduct an impartial process, but environmental groups fear the new appointees are pursuing a predetermined outcome. Before it can begin selling leases to drill for oil, the Interior Department is required by law to conduct environmental studies to help identify and address potentially negative consequences. The studies are typically time-consuming and involve extensive public engagement. But the Trump administration has moved to fast-track them. The biggest and most important of the studies is on pace to be completed in half the usual time, and only one public hearing has been held outside Alaska.  Opponents fear that cutting corners could jeopardize the environment or put wildlife, such as polar bears, in harm's way. They point to problems associated with seismic testing in the mid-1980s. But the Interior Department says that its procedures have improved since then, and that the environmental reviews can be conducted more speedily this time because of previously collected scientific material. Big-name oil companies have been largely absent from the public discussions about tapping oil reserves on the coastal plain, but a lesser-known company called Arctic Slope Regional Corporation has taken a leading role. The corporation, one of 13 formed in the 1970s to foster economic development among Alaska's indigenous population, stands to enjoy a windfall from oil development, in part because it separately owns rights to drill on 92,000 acres within the coastal plain. The corporation, which has been a key financial backer of Ms. Murkowski, ramped up its lobbying efforts in Washington under the Trump administration. The role of A.S.R.C., a private company that counts 13,000 Alaska Natives as it shareholders, has become a flash point in the debate between Native communities over the fate of the coastal plain.  Natives who live in the coastal area, many of whom are A.S.R.C. shareholders, generally support oil development. Other Natives who live south of the refuge oppose drilling. They fear it would disturb the migration of porcupine caribou, animals they have hunted for centuries for food. Drilling proponents of drilling have never been this close to achieving their goals, but even the most optimistic among them say actual drilling is a decade or more away. The potential headwinds are formidable.  For one, environmental groups are closely watching every step of the process, and lawsuits are likely. And Democrats will soon control the House of Representatives, and are pledging to make aggressive oversight of the leasing process a priority. For its part, the Interior Department says it is using extreme care, knowing full well the challenges ahead."
News,2018-12-03,"FAIRBANKS, Alaska — It is the last great stretch of nothingness in the United States, a vast landscape of mosses, sedges and shrubs that is home to migrating caribou and the winter dens of polar bears.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/us/oil-drilling-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge.html,4109," FAIRBANKS, Alaska — It is the last great stretch of nothingness in the United States, a vast landscape of mosses, sedges and shrubs that is home to migrating caribou and the winter dens of polar bears. Aside from a Native village at its northern tip, civilization has not dented its 19 million acres, an area the size of South Carolina. There are no roads and no visitors beyond the occasional hunter and backpacker. But the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — a federally protected place of austere beauty that during a recent flyover was painted white by heavy snowfall — is on the cusp of major change. The biggest untapped onshore trove of oil in North America is believed to lie beneath the refuge's coastal plain along the Beaufort Sea. For more than a generation, opposition to drilling has left the refuge largely unscathed, but now the Trump administration, working with Republicans in Congress and an influential and wealthy Alaska Native corporation, is clearing the way for oil exploration along the coast. Decades of protections are unwinding with extraordinary speed as Republicans move to lock in drilling opportunities before the 2020 presidential election, according to interviews with over three dozen people and a review of internal government deliberations and federal documents. To that end, the Trump administration is on pace to finish an environmental impact assessment in half the usual time. An even shorter evaluation of the consequences of seismic testing is nearing completion. Within months, trucks weighing up to 90,000 pounds could be conducting the tests across the tundra as they try to pinpoint oil reserves. While actual oil production would be a decade or more away, the turnaround represents a prized breakthrough in the Trump administration's campaign to exploit fossil fuels and erase restrictive policies protecting the environment and addressing global warming. [Here are six key takeaways from The Times's examination of the race for Alaskan oil.]  The Interior Department, which has jurisdiction over the Arctic refuge, has been central to the administration's regulatory rollback in Alaska and beyond, accommodating the wishes of big businesses to strip down rules on how federal lands can be used. The oil and gas industry has been among the biggest beneficiaries as the administration has relaxed or abandoned regulations meant to safeguard air quality, groundwater supplies and wildlife.

It is also pushing for more exploration and production offshore and in the National Petroleum Reserve, west of the refuge. All of this is coming despite a glut in domestic oil production that raises the question of whether more oil from the Arctic — which is costly to produce — is necessary or makes economic sense, especially given the need to eventually wean the world off fossil fuels. The fate of the refuge's coastal plain is in the hands of Ryan Zinke, the Interior secretary, who has appointed top deputies with deep professional and political ties to Alaska to oversee its development. In 2014, two of the appointees were involved in an unsuccessful court challenge to Obama-era policies that had helped keep the area off limits. Congressional approval to open the area to oil exploration was inserted in tax overhaul legislation last December under the guise of generating revenue for the federal government, and by next year, the Interior Department expects to begin selling the first drilling leases. The hurried timeline has created friction, with some specialists in the federal government concerned that environmental risks are being downplayed or ignored. And many outside scientists and environmentalists share the concerns, warning that plans for seismic testing and eventual drilling could harass, injure or kill polar bears and other wildlife. ""It seems as though the administration is in a headlong rush to put the drill bit into the coastal plain,"" said David J. Hayes, a deputy Interior secretary in the Obama and Clinton administrations. ""Given the virgin territory of the refuge, with the unique wildlife dependency issues, I don't know how you do this in an artificially fast and truncated fashion."" Mr. Zinke's Alaska-friendly appointees, who have long pushed for oil exploration in the coastal plain, say the fears are overstated. They point out that years ago, Congress left open the eventual possibility of allowing development there. Exploration is in the best interest of Alaskans, they say. ""I feel like there is a lot of expectations, hopes and dreams from people who I know and love that are riding on this,"" said Joe Balash, one of the appointees, who has worked in Alaskan political circles for two decades and now oversees the Bureau of Land Management. An Alaska Native company, Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, has been a major force behind the push and stands to enjoy a windfall if drilling proceeds. The corporation, which has been awarded more than $7.5 billion in federal contracts in the past 10 years, expanded its lobbying under the Trump administration, records show, and Mr. Zinke appointed one of its executives to a top post. Known as A.S.R.C., it is among 13 regional businesses created in the 1970s to foster economic development among Alaska's indigenous population. It has myriad financial interests in the state's oil-rich North Slope region, which includes the refuge's coastal plain and Prudhoe Bay, home to one of the largest oil fields in North America. And it has been a key financial backer of Senator Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican, who has been the drilling plan's biggest champion in Congress. Many Natives on the North Slope — including Inupiat who live in Kaktovik, the village inside the refuge — support oil development. But another group that lives south of the refuge, the Gwich'in, fears oil development would disturb the migration of porcupine caribou, animals it has hunted for centuries and still relies on for much of its food. A nationwide poll last year by researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities showed that 70 percent of registered voters in the United States opposed drilling in the reserve. Ms. Murkowski declined to comment, as did Alaska's other elected representatives in Washington. Mr. Zinke also declined to comment. But he told a Senate committee in March that he was ""very bullish on the Arctic."" The struggle over oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has its roots 50 years ago in the discovery of petroleum reserves around Prudhoe Bay, west of the refuge. Congress in 1960 had set aside millions of acres in northeast Alaska for wildlife, lands that were largely off the beaten path, geographically and politically, and included the refuge's coastal plain. But with the Prudhoe Bay discovery in 1968, the calculus changed. Many thought the plain might hold riches too. In 1980, when Congress voted to conserve much of the federal land in Alaska, drilling advocates pushed for oil and gas development on the coastal plain. Then, as now, the move was supported by many Alaskans, who generally favor oil development, in part because some of the revenue is returned to them in the form of an annual dividend. Drilling has largely had bipartisan support among Alaskan lawmakers as well. The advocates were unsuccessful but had an opening: The 1980 bill allowed Congress to authorize oil and gas development at a later date. The 1.5-million-acre coastal plain, identified in Section 1002 of the legislation, has been known since as the 1002 Area. In 1995, with Republicans controlling both houses of Congress for the first time in decades, legislation was approved to allow development. But Democrats opposed the measure and President Bill Clinton vetoed it. When Republicans held on to Congress in the 2016 elections and President Trump won the White House, drilling proponents saw another opening. Ms. Murkowski told reporters within hours of Mr. Trump's victory that she would renew the push for legislation. That set in motion a furious effort to win congressional approval and position the Interior Department to carry a plan forward. A flight from Alaska's central Arctic coast to Fairbanks is a straight shot. But when Mr. Zinke and Ms. Murkowski flew the route in May last year, just a few months into the Interior secretary's tenure, the pilot made a wide detour to the east. Below them was the vast 1002 Area, extending between the Brooks Range and the Beaufort Sea, still off limits to oil and gas exploration but now within their political sights. A few days later in Anchorage, Ms. Murkowski introduced Mr. Zinke at an oil and gas conference. ""The only path for energy dominance is a path through the great state of Alaska,"" Mr. Zinke told the group. Seven months later, Congress voted to open the coastal plain to exploration. Getting approval in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives was not an issue. But in the Senate, Ms. Murkowski needed a bill that could survive a likely filibuster. The solution was to characterize oil exploration as a revenue raiser — with a target of $1 billion for the Treasury over 10 years — and insert it into Mr. Trump's tax overhaul legislation. The oil provision authorized two lease sales of drilling rights for at least 400,000 acres each, directing the ""Secretary of Interior, acting through the Bureau of Land Management,"" to oversee the development. The innocuous-sounding bureaucratic language was intended to fast-track the effort by marginalizing skeptics in another Interior agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service. At a hearing, current and former Alaska politicians spoke in favor of opening the refuge, as did representatives of two Native corporations, including A.S.R.C. Several A.S.R.C. executives stayed in Washington to press for the measure, part of a push that saw the corporation's lobbying expenditures nearly double to $590,000 in 2017 from $320,000 the previous year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group. The A.S.R.C. officials were joined by Natives from Kaktovik in the Senate gallery on Dec. 20, when the bill was approved on a straight party-line vote, and later that day on the South Lawn of the White House and in the Oval Office. During a cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump praised the decision to open land that ""for 40 years this country was unable to touch."" And in a message posted to Twitter, Mr. Zinke wrote, ""It was a key part of @realDonaldTrump budget."" Mr. Zinke had been preparing for this moment since he took office. As his confirmation hearing, he had promised a fresh approach to Alaska, and he went about delivering on that pledge by filling important jobs at the Interior Department with Alaska and Arctic exploration in mind. A Washington lobbyist, David Bernhardt, was appointed deputy secretary. Mr. Bernhardt had represented Alaska in litigation against the federal government, including an unsuccessful lawsuit in 2014 that sought a review of the state's plan for exploring oil and gas resources within the coastal plain of the refuge. Earlier, he served at the Interior Department under President George W. Bush. A campaign manager to Ms. Murkowski, Steve Wackowski, was named senior adviser for Alaskan affairs. He had also had a job as operations manager for a joint venture focused on remote sensing in North Slope oil fields, his résumé said. An owner of that venture is Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, a Native company that has surface rights in the refuge and a stake, along with A.S.R.C., in another partnership seeking to conduct seismic testing there. A third official with Alaska ties, Mr. Balash, now oversees the Bureau of Land Management, giving him direct oversight of Arctic exploration. His first day on the job was the day after the tax legislation passed. Mr. Balash grew up in Alaska and served as chief of staff to Senator Dan Sullivan, the Alaska Republican. In 2014, when the state sued the federal government, he was commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. ""Given my background and work history,"" Mr. Balash said, ""I felt privileged to be able to work on this project. It has been something that, obviously, has been a subject of some debate."" Drilling proponents cheered the appointments. ""We had no friends under Obama,"" said Rebecca Logan, chief executive of the Alaska Support Industry Alliance, a trade group representing over 500 companies that provide oil field services. ""Now, we've got the Interior Department where there are great Alaskan friends."" Despite the close ties, industry officials insist they are not getting a free pass. ""I'm not expecting a rubber stamp,"" said Kara Moriarty, the chief executive of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, who has a framed photo with Mr. Zinke in her Anchorage office. ""I'm expecting a very diligent and thorough process."" But those who oppose drilling in the refuge, including many Democrats in Washington, suspect the Department of Interior is not being so diligent. Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who will become chairman of the Natural Resources Committee next month, said he would probably call a hearing about the Arctic development with the goal of slowing it down. ""We can make sure that corners are not being cut,"" said Mr. Grijalva, who last week called for Mr. Zinke to resign because of ethics allegations against him, prompting a personal attack from the secretary. Scores of environmental organizations are also watching closely, ready to sue whenever an opportunity arises. ""There are groups out there who will fight this tooth and nail, no matter what,"" Mr. Balash said. ""It is fair to say I've been lawyered up on this project from Day 1."" One time-consuming hurdle for big drilling projects is getting the environmental clearances. During the Obama administration, the environmental review of drilling prospects in another part of Alaska ran well over 1,000 pages and took two and a half years to complete. Not this time. A draft environmental impact statement on the coastal plain leasing plan is expected to be released soon, with the finished version to follow next spring, just a year after being ordered. And a separate assessment of seismic testing is also expected any day, that one just months in the making. The hurry-up follows a directive from Mr. Bernhardt, the deputy secretary, limiting all environmental impact statements to one year and 150 pages, or 300 pages for ""unusually complex"" projects. Mr. Bernhardt cited the need to reduce paperwork. Mr. Balash, of the Bureau of Land Management, said the shorter time frame was also possible in part because the bureau was relying on past scientific studies. ""It's not as though we're starting from scratch,"" he said. Older studies may be less useful, however, because of changes in the Arctic related to warming. Completing the environmental impact statement by next spring should allow the department to sell leases in 2019, Mr. Balash said, even faster than in the language of the 2017 tax bill. In justifying the pace, Mr. Balash said many people had ""been waiting for this for a very long time."" Opponents say that having leases in the hands of oil companies before the 2020 elections would make halting the drilling program more difficult should a Democrat win the White House. They also complain that the public has been sidelined in the interest of speed. Although the fate of the Arctic refuge is a federal issue of national interest, just one hearing has been held outside Alaska. ""There's going to be damage, going to be long-lasting effects from what they do,"" said Geoffrey L. Haskett, president of the National Wildlife Refuge Association and a former Alaska regional director with the Fish and Wildlife Service, the managing agency of the refuge. ""I just can't imagine that what we're going to see is going to be adequate,"" he added, referring to the environmental evaluations. The rushed schedule has led to rifts between the Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife Service, which was forced into a secondary role by the language of the tax bill. Greta Burkart, an aquatic ecologist who resigned in June after more than seven years with the service in Alaska, said the accelerated process had further marginalized the agency. Dr. Burkart said that was one of the reasons she resigned. ""I felt there was little that Fish and Wildlife could do at that point,"" she said. She said that scientists were given less time than usual to provide expert comment on draft sections of the environmental reviews — just 48 hours in some cases — and that their comments were sometimes not acknowledged. Other current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, had similar complaints. The decision to conduct an environmental assessment of the seismic testing proposal, a less rigorous review than a full environmental impact statement, was especially troubling for many drilling opponents. They point to damage done to the tundra by seismic testing in the mid-1980s; some vehicle tracks from that work remain visible more than 30 years later. And they worry about the disruption of polar bears. The population of polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea has been declining for years as climate change has reduced the extent of sea ice in the Arctic. The population is now estimated at 800 to 900 animals. Pregnant bears dig winter dens in the snow on the coastal plain, and if those dens are not detected during the seismic work, the mothers and their newborn cubs could be disturbed or endangered by the heavy trucks. [Read more in this interview with a polar bear expert.] Steven C. Amstrup, chief scientist with Polar Bears International, a conservation group, said the coastal plain in the refuge "" ""is the most important maternal denning area"" for the southern Beaufort Sea population. Dr. Amstrup, a former United States Geological Survey zoologist who has studied the bears for three decades, said his research had shown that the heat-sensing technology used to detect dens would probably miss about half the dens, which would probably be disturbed during the seismic work. Jeff Hastings, chairman of SAExploration, part of the seismic-testing joint venture, said improved technology would prevent damage to the tundra this time around. He also said his company was working with the Interior Department on ways to protect the bears by holding off on testing in some areas until after the animals have left their dens, for example. When Mr. Zinke went in search of influential Alaskans to fill top posts in his Interior Department, he turned to people who had worked for elected officials in the state and for past Republican administrations in Washington. He also looked to A.S.R.C., a multibillion-dollar business that stands to gain the most financially if drilling commences in the 1002 Area. Tara Sweeney, its former executive vice president for external affairs, is now assistant secretary for Indian affairs. Her federal financial disclosure form, filed in February, showed that at A.S.R.C. she had been paid more than $1 million over the prior 13 months, including incentives from previous years. The cultural accents on the grounds of A.S.R.C.'s corporate offices in Anchorage honor the traditions of its 13,000 Native shareholders, and feature Inupiaq sculptures and a diorama of a whaling festival. But inside the 10-story building, A.S.R.C. reveals itself as a powerful conglomerate poised to take full advantage of any oil and gas exploration to come. Its subsidiaries include an energy services outfit, a fuel-refining and marketing operation and a construction company, all at the ready to supply services to oil companies that acquire drilling rights. A.S.R.C. also has a stake in the seismic-testing partnership lined up to explore the 1002 Area, as well as rights to drill on 92,000 acres within 1002. More than 30 years ago, BP and Chevron drilled a single test hole in the 1002 Area on land leased from A.S.R.C. and Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation. The results of that test, which have been kept secret, may hold clues about the reserves that could help explain A.S.R.C.'s enthusiasm for drilling. Bill Horn, a Reagan administration official who helped negotiate the deal that gave A.S.R.C. drilling rights in the 1002 Area, recalled how people involved in the drilling left that testing in 1986 ""hot to trot"" about the potential reserves. With nearly $2.7 billion in annual revenue, A.S.R.C. is the largest of the Alaska Native corporations and ranks 169th on Forbes's nationwide list of private companies by revenue. Still, A.S.R.C. has little name recognition outside Alaska, allowing it to attract relatively little attention while lobbying. ""We like being under the radar,"" said Teresa Imm, the company's senior vice president for resource development, who was among the executives who traveled to Washington last year to press for the tax legislation. Over the past decade, the company has spent more than $3 million on lobbying, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Some of the A.S.R.C. leaders, including Ms. Imm, are not Alaska Natives, but the company has had the ability to speak and act on behalf of Native communities. Ms. Imm said A.S.R.C. was simply trying to make good on promises to develop the land for its shareholders. But there are deep disagreements over A.S.R.C.'s role in the drilling campaign, and whether its corporate interests align with those of Native families who have lived off the land for generations. Some, like Sam Alexander, a Gwich'in formerly from Fort Yukon, say A.S.R.C. has gone too far. ""Native corporations are not tribes,"" said Mr. Alexander, who teaches at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ""The only thing Native about them is their name. They are just corporations."" A.S.R.C. officials say that the company has never represented itself as a tribe, but that its shareholders are members of various Alaskan tribes. For decades, the Gwich'in have led the Native opposition to drilling, arguing that opening the 1002 Area could affect the porcupine caribou, a major source of food and a spiritual touchstone. ""We are asking to continue to live the way we always have,"" said Bernadette Demientieff, the executive director of the Gwich'in Steering Committee, which opposes oil development in the refuge and recently joined with the Sierra Club to try to persuade banks to hold back financing for exploration. The steering committee has also worked with environmental groups to persuade politicians to defend the refuge from drilling. Matthew Rexford, the tribal administrator of Kaktovik and the president of Kaktovik Inupiat Group, said the drilling could be done responsibly and should go forward. Unlike the Gwich'in, Mr. Rexford's village stands to benefit financially. ""I have given this a lot of thought, and our community has given this a lot of thought,"" he said. ""We do feel it can be done in an environmentally safe and sound manner."" But some Inupiat have reservations. ""Think about what's going to happen to this land if there is an oil spill and the response that's going to come along with it,"" Adrienne Aakaluk Titus, a community organizer in Fairbanks, said at hearing in Kaktovik. The muscle of the Native corporations has not been lost on Alaskan politicians like Ms. Murkowski, who has supported their interests and been rewarded in return. Under federal law, the corporations are considered ""disadvantaged,"" meaning they receive preference in contracting. A.S.R.C. and the other 12 regional corporations received $3.3 billion in contracts in the 2017 fiscal year, federal data show. Beginning in 2009, there was a move in Congress to curtail the preferential treatment. An investigation by a Senate subcommittee found that the corporations were among the largest federal contractors, often landing high-value contracts without having to bid. Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who led the subcommittee, complained that the corporations relied ""heavily on non-Native managers"" and employed ""relatively few of their shareholders"" as she pushed for changes to contracting practices, some of which went into effect in 2011. Ms. Murkowski helped limit the changes, defending the work of the Native corporations and arguing, along with other Alaskan officials, that her Senate colleagues should not use income alone to measure disadvantage. ""We're talking about a population many times without a road system or water supply system,"" she said in 2011. A year earlier, when Ms. Murkowski lost the Republican Senate primary, she took the unusual step of seeking re-election as a write-in candidate. It was a complicated feat that leaned heavily on her support among the Native corporations. The corporations set up a political action committee that spent $1.6 million to back her successful campaign. A.S.R.C. was one of the largest supporters, contributing $200,000. A year ago, after the tax bill passed, the A.S.R.C.'s newsletter featured a photograph on its cover from an Oval Office celebration with Mr. Trump. Ms. Murkowski, beaming, appeared surrounded by Alaska Natives and A.S.R.C. officials."

",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/opinion/motherhood-maternal-infant-mortality.html,1352," Why are American mothers dying in childbirth at higher rates than in other developed countries? And who is to blame? Kim Brooks raised these questions in her Opinion essay ""America Is Blaming Pregnant Women for Their Own Deaths."" More than 900 readers responded with comments on the article, including parents who shared their own harrowing birth stories and who often said they felt their lives were devalued, in favor of their child's, by their doctors during the delivery process.  Medical professionals responded with accounts of systemic problems within the health care industry, such as the lack of emergency protocols in hospitals that would protect the life of the mother. Kayla Tab, a nurse in San Francisco, commented on the difficulties of weighing which life to prioritize in the case of an emergency: ""In health care, we may make it seem like it's all about the baby, but that's often times because the fear of a stillbirth weighs so heavily on us. We feel caught in the middle."" For one commenter and his wife, the decision was clear cut. ""We went into it, no questions asked, mother's life,"" he wrote. ""As tragic as a child's loss is, without the mother, the child doesn't happen."" Read more comments below from our readers. They have been edited for clarity and length. This is not just a problem of hospitals, doctors and public policy, but also of social demands. Anything a woman desires for herself — autonomy, respect, physical wholeness — is considered selfish. Get a group of new mothers together and eventually they will start to tell their birth stories — the joys, horrors, indignities, pain and subtle, or not so subtle, misogyny. And in the midst of this ""safe space"" it never takes long before one woman will say, ""You have a healthy baby, that's all that matters."" This can only happen in a society in which women are constantly devalued. It's not a zero sum game: healthy baby or healthy mother; we can have both. — Corey Anderson, Atlanta There are many sides to making sure women are heard. Choice over our bodies also includes the right to a ""medicalized"" birth, if that is our preference. Medical interventions save lives, and many women, myself included, prefer that their doctors err on the side of the baby's life. Go on any pregnancy message board and you will find that there are tons of expectant mothers who put the ""birth experience"" before the health of their baby and who consider medical actions taken to save their child's life as some kind of affront to that experience. — A F, Connecticut We welcomed our first child this spring. The process left much to be desired. I feel if I hadn't been there to speak up for my wife, it could have gone awfully different. I don't have a whole lot of faith in the new generation of doctors. In our encounters, they seemed entitled and even forceful, taking steps without checking with the mother and pressing unneeded procedures. I had to assert myself into the situation more than once to have my wife's concerns heard. — WI Transplant, Madison, Wis.  I am an obstetrician and this is an exceedingly important topic, one that many people are passionately devoting their lives to correcting. I believe that the system we work in is flawed from top to bottom, in ways that create serious gaps for low-income and low-resource patients. But I fear the author is doing a disservice to this topic by equating these particular terrifying outcomes with poor care by doctors. These anecdotes don't highlight this crisis particularly well and only fan the flames of the anti-medicine, anti-doctor rhetoric that gets in the way of caring for people. There are bad doctors just like there are bad plumbers, but it's the system that is failing people, not the individuals. — MMS, Cambridge, Mass.  As a mother who recently gave birth, I am of two minds about this issue. Having seen many women of my generation flippantly reject medical care to give birth in their living rooms with midwives with little training, and others who feel guilt for years for having succumbed to C-sections, having ""failed"" at the ideal, natural birth, I wish that we could get over the medical-establishment-as-villain narrative. I've had seven pregnancies and have one living child. I have my living child because of, not in spite of, medical science. — Amv, New York The idea that women know what's best in some natural way is wrongheaded. My wife would have died if she'd made the now routine choice to determine her own care path and have the baby at home. This feels akin to the vaccine craze, something that's been safe for so long but now people don't feel the danger associated with deviating from the well-worn path. — John McDavid, Nevada Women don't need more doulas, midwives or listening to, although all of those things can be beneficial. The two greatest threats to women's health in and after childbirth are a doctor's low index of suspicion of symptoms that could indicate underlying injuries and a reluctance — or inability — to deploy high-tech interventions in a timely fashion. That's why California has had success in reducing maternal mortality. They've gone back to basics, recognizing that childbirth has always been, in every time, place and culture, one of the leading causes of death of women and that only technology used liberally can reduce that death rate. — Amy Tuteur, M.D., Boston Women are routinely not listened to or believed, especially black women, whose maternal mortality rates are 3.5 times higher than white women, as the author points out. Postpartum anxiety and depression, traumatic birth injuries, an abysmal lack of paid parental leave, judgment from family members, all of this is isolating, as well as physically and mentally debilitating. — New Mama, Massachusetts I am a physician and I have no doubt that the problems with obstetric care described are real and in need of correction. However, conditions for an optimal outcome for mother and baby start much earlier in pregnancy, if not before. Many women, particularly those who are poor or in a minority, have other adverse factors like poor nutrition, teen pregnancy and substance abuse, to name a few. Pointing this out is not ""blaming the victim,"" but rather showing the need for a vigorous public health response and universal access to family planning and prenatal care. — Hoarbear, Pittsburgh This story says nothing about one of the most obvious reasons why maternal mortality continues to rise in the U.S.A. but not in other developed countries: health insurance. The availability, or not, of high-quality prenatal, obstetric and postpartum care correlates directly with the mother's financial resources. Until all women can access high-quality medical care, nothing will change. — Nikki, Islandia It infuriates me that women in this country are denied birth control and autonomy over their own bodies by law when it comes to taking steps to prevent or terminate a pregnancy that took joint efforts with a man to create; seen as mere incubators and a secondary concern to a fetus once they are pregnant; and dismissed as mere statistics when they die in childbirth after a full-term pregnancy.  Spare me the ""it's a scary time for young men in America"" nonsense that's being parroted by the obtuse and ignorant misogynists, like Trump. If it's scary to be a man right now, then it's downright dangerous, even fatal, to be a woman. — EM, Los Angeles Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
News,2018-12-04,"Turning Point: North and South Korean athletes march under a unified flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/opinion/korea-hyeonseo-lee.html,931," Turning Point: North and South Korean athletes march under a unified flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Growing up in North Korea in the 1980s, I was brainwashed into believing that South Koreans were suffering horribly under their government, but that with the unconditional support of the North Korean people, our ""Dear Leader"" Kim Il-sung would liberate our southern neighbors and reunify the Korean Peninsula. I eventually escaped my homeland as a teenager and learned the harsh truth, yet I still hold on to a sliver of hope that I will one day live in a united and free Korea. In 2015, I found myself standing next to a section of the Berlin Wall after giving a TEDx talk about North Korea. I started chatting with a woman from the former East Germany, who told me about the surreal excitement that gripped Berlin on the day the wall fell in November 1989. Germans started rushing toward the wall to see if the seemingly impossible had actually happened. People cried tears of joy as a boundary that had artificially divided the German people for so long was finally destroyed. I desperately want the Korean people to experience a similar moment. After fighting back tears, I signed a still-standing section of the Berlin Wall with a special message. I vowed that within my lifetime I would help to remove the ugly scar of the Demilitarized Zone, the line that divides the Korean Peninsula — and its people — in two. Despite the renewed optimism for reconciliation between the North and South following recent summits with the nations' leaders, the prospect of reunification remains dim. One recent trend has been particularly disheartening: Survey data indicates that a sizable number of South Koreans, particularly younger Southerners, are resistant to reunification. One of the primary reasons is the massive financial burden that reunification would impose on South Korea, which, based on some estimates, could cost between $1 trillion and $3 trillion. Also at issue are the widening cultural and economic gaps caused by over 70 years of division, which have diminished the importance of a shared ethnic heritage, leading some Koreans on both sides of the DMZ to reject the idea of a united Korean national identity. Despite these challenges, the long-term economic and security benefits of reunification greatly outweigh the short-term costs. The South's capital and technology combined with the North's natural resources and immense labor pool would create significant economic opportunities for the peninsula. A united Korea would also have a stronger military. Koreans concerned about the burdens of reunification must consider it from a deeper perspective. We owe an extraordinary debt of gratitude to those ancestors who sacrificed their lives to fight for Korea's independence and freedom. Our culture and language live on because of them. It is our duty to continue marching along the path paved by our ancestors — toward a strong, whole and united Korea. Unfortunately, there is another major obstacle standing in our way: the striking lack of tolerance extending across the entire peninsula. Even after North Korean defectors have denounced the regime and embraced life in the South, many South Koreans still refuse to accept them, subjecting escapees to bullying, ostracism and other forms of mistreatment. Partly as a result, separate schools have been established in the South to help young Northerners adjust to their new lives. But even as adults, Northerners are subject to workplace discrimination and social isolation. A 2018 study found that ""suicidal thoughts and behaviors"" are more common among North Korean defectors than the South Korean population at large. Unfortunately, South Koreans would likely face the same problems in the North if the situation were reversed. In North Korea, where the average citizen has little interaction with foreigners or exposure to other cultures, racism and xenophobia are ingrained and unabashed — a hostility that reaches to the very top. The regime's propagandists brazenly referred to former President Barack Obama as a ""wicked black monkey"" during his second term. South Koreans can also be hostile to outsiders. The arrival earlier this year of a few hundred Yemeni asylum-seekers on the island of Jeju sparked a fierce backlash, based in part on concerns over crime, jobs and cultural differences. Hundreds of thousands of Southerners signed a petition urging their government to reject the refugees. South Koreans expressing such sentiments fail to acknowledge that many Koreans were themselves accepted as refugees and adopted by foreigners in the aftermath of the Korean War. (Sadly, members of the Korean diaspora who return to the peninsula today to live and explore their roots are sometimes rejected for not being Korean enough.) Some South Koreans also forget that foreign soldiers fought and died alongside their countrymen during the war. Given this history, and that South Korea is a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention, the South has an obligation to embrace those fleeing war and other calamities throughout the world. To those Koreans who are uncomfortable with the notion of an inclusive society, I say this: If you want a united Korea to be accepted as a member of the international community, this is a reality you must learn to accept. Having more personal interactions with foreigners is a critical first step. The ancestors who fought for our freedom left us a legacy of sacrifice. We must leave the same legacy for the generations to come, by doing what is necessary to create a united and welcoming Korea — one that all Koreans, as well as all those seeking shelter from foreign conflicts, can call home."

Still these are important meetings at which American leadership normally yields significant outcomes that benefit the country's economy and national security. However, with Donald Trump as president, one can be forgiven for worrying what chaos may ensue at yet another multilateral forum. I have learned to brace myself for blows to our national standing every time Mr. Trump travels abroad — the mental equivalent of a pre-emptive defensive crouch. Last week's meeting in Buenos Aires was no different. In fact, it appeared to be an even more inauspicious moment than usual for a high-stakes foreign trip. Ukraine and Russia remain on hair-trigger war footing, while President Trump resorted inexplicably to his classic ""both sides-ism"" rather than clearly condemning Russian aggression. Having whitewashed the Saudi crown prince's apparent direct involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, President Trump abandoned all pretense of principled leadership by pledging to pursue business as usual with the Saudis. Then, just as the president was about to be wheels-up, the guilty plea by his former lawyer Michael Cohen revealed that Mr. Trump was more enmeshed in discussions over a potential Russian business deal during the 2016 presidential campaign than he had previously acknowledged.  Against this backdrop, and grading on a curve (since every grade can't be an F lest it become meaningless), President Trump's trip to the G-20 could have been a lot worse. We can exhale, noting that no major damage was done. This time, Mr. Trump refrained from publicly vilifying core United States institutions like the courts, the F.B.I. and C.I.A. He neither assailed his political adversaries nor committed major gaffes. Without explanation, Mr. Trump downgraded to private pull-asides two previously planned full bilateral meetings with the Turkish and South Korean leaders, but, thankfully, he avoided insulting any treaty ally. He even flattered his usual nemesis, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. The president was not caught lavishing praise on dictatorial adversaries, having wisely (if likely for reasons other than those claimed) canceled a replay of the disastrous one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia in Helsinki. While we will never know what Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin discussed informally at the G-20 dinner, their exchange was comparatively abbreviated and perhaps less risky.  In addition, Mr. Trump avoided a full-on, public embrace of the pariah crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, leaving it to Mr. Putin and the prince to mime how fellow thugs salute each other when America has taken leave of its moral leadership. Mr. Trump spoke respectfully of former President George H.W. Bush, whose death on Friday provided Americans one final public service by affording President Trump a lame, if handy, excuse to cancel the traditional post-summit news conference. As someone who endured the complaints of the White House press corps when President Barack Obama provided far more generous public access, my initial reaction to this evasion was outrage. But soon, my anger was surpassed by gratitude that Mr. Trump managed to skirt the spectacle of another unscripted news conference on foreign soil. Despite the United States looking petty and isolated as the global outlier on climate change, the G-20 leaders did manage to agree on a final summit communiqué. This once-standard outcome used to be taken for granted but is no longer after Mr. Trump blew up this year's G-7 summit and rattled leaders at NATO, and, just two weeks ago, Vice President Pence left the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference without any agreement. No progress appears to have been made on addressing key global security challenges such as renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine, the Saudi-led war in Yemen, or the unabated North Korean nuclear threat. Rather than rally the Western world to impose additional sanctions on Russia or to punish the Saudis for murdering an American resident in cold blood and repeatedly lying about it, President Trump and his team again took a pass on exerting traditional American leadership. These were significant missed opportunities but not new sins of commission. The signing of the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, marked a milestone toward ending the American-induced crisis with its two neighbors. Yet Mr. Trump declared victory prematurely, given that congressional approval is far from certain. Meanwhile, Canada and Mexico still chafe at continued steel and aluminum tariffs. Finally, President Trump chose to tap the brakes rather than drive the United States-China relationship over the cliff. By agreeing with President Xi Jinping of China to pause additional tariffs for 90 days to allow for continued trade negotiations in exchange for vague Chinese commitments to buy more American goods — plus a welcome commitment to restrict the availability of fentanyl — Mr. Trump has postponed escalation of his costly and risky trade war with Beijing. While perhaps only a temporary respite, this marks the most significant result of the G-20 gathering. With Mr. Trump back on American soil, we can safely conclude that, at least this time, we dodged another blow to our national honor, even as we have surrendered our global leadership and become mostly a global bystander. We can only hope that Mr. Trump and his top advisers will now discern that less is more when it comes to this president's travels abroad. Susan E.

News,2018-12-04,"A new contract with Marriott International that will give housekeepers in San Francisco an eventual $4-an-hour increase and better protections against sexual harassment was approved Monday, ending a nine-week strike by 2,500 workers at seven hotels in that city.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/travel/san-francisco-marriott-strike-over.html,727," A new contract with Marriott International that will give housekeepers in San Francisco an eventual $4-an-hour increase and better protections against sexual harassment was approved Monday, ending a nine-week strike by 2,500 workers at seven hotels in that city. The settlement in San Francisco concludes a nationwide walkout against the world's largest hotel chain. At its peak, the protest involved 7,700 workers at 23 hotels. ""It means so much to me,"" said Larrilou Carumba, a single mother of three who had been earning $23.50 an hour after six years as a housekeeper at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis. ""I can go back to work,"" she said, without worrying ""about where I will get money for my kids, and my health benefits."" Workers at the Marriott Marquis, along with the Marriott Union Square, the Palace Hotel, the St. Regis, the W, and the Westin St. Francis, are set to return to their jobs on Wednesday. ""We look forward to welcoming our associates back at work,"" said Connie Kim, a spokeswoman for Marriott. She declined to comment further. Marriott International is the world's largest hotel chain, with management or franchise agreements under 30 brands in 130 countries and territories. It had net profits last year of $1.37 billion. The dispute involved a range of Marriott brands in Boston; Detroit; four California cities —San Jose, Oakland, San Diego and San Francisco; and Honolulu and Lahaina, in Hawaii.  The deals varied according to the cost of living and ""union density"" in each city, according to Rachel Gumpert, a spokeswoman for the Unite Here union. In San Francisco, she said, it provides ""strong wage increases"" for all workers, improved pensions and preservation of lifetime health care benefits.  A worker in San Francisco who retires while the new contract is in place will receive a pension of $50 per month for each year of employment, said Anand Singh, the president of Unite Here Local 2, which represented the workers in San Francisco. Housekeepers, who are generally the lowest paid workers, will receive increases starting at $1.75 an hour and growing to more than $4 an hour over the life of the four-year contract. The current median wage for housekeepers is $23 an hour, Ms. Gumpert said.  All employees who deal with guests one on one, such as housekeepers and workers who deliver room service or bags, will receive a silent GPS-enabled panic button to summon help if they feel unsafe, she said. Under old work rules, if an employee accused a guest of sexual harassment he or she could only be assured of avoiding contact with that person for a day. Now, employees can have no further contact with the guest, Ms. Gumpert said. And, if there is a ""credible report of inappropriate sexual behavior or unwanted sexual advances,"" the hotel will evict the guest, she said. Housekeepers will also receive a reduced workload that increases over the life of the contract, especially if they have a number of rooms that don't receive daily cleaning as part of Marriott's ""Make A Green Choice"" program. The initiative, billed as an environmental alternative, offers loyalty points to guests who forgo daily room cleaning. Housekeepers had complained that it disrupted the schedule for deep cleaning and that they were at risk of injury while trying to get through the heavy work in all their allotted rooms, no matter how many had previously been pulled from the daily cleaning pool, Ms. Gumpert said. While the financial terms varied by city, the sexual harassment agreement is included in all the contracts. There is also a nationwide plan to bring Marriott officials and union representatives together to discuss automation in the hotels, Ms. Gumpert said.  Ms. Carumba, like many housekeepers, had been working a second job to make ends meet, cleaning a laundromat for three hours each day. ""I will be able to take care of my kids now because I don't need to go work another job,"" she said. The strike in San Francisco was particularly confrontational, and more than 100 union employees have been arrested since it began, on Oct. 4. Mr. Singh was arrested twice for civil disobedience. ""I think this campaign and the contract that we achieved certainly sets the standard in San Francisco, and it demonstrates that militant action in today's economy, even with large employers, can deal real successes,"" Mr. Singh said. ""We certainly hope it paves the way for settlements in our industry and in other industries."""
News,2018-12-04,"When Hayley Hanway graduated from the University of Michigan in 2013, she expected to quickly land a job in her desired field of ecosystem management.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/well/family/late-to-launch-the-post-collegiate-struggle.html,1385," When Hayley Hanway graduated from the University of Michigan in 2013, she expected to quickly land a job in her desired field of ecosystem management. She had a respectable grade point average as an environmental science major from one of the nation's top-rated public schools. She had participated in a climate science program at Oxford University in England and spent a summer working for an environmental conservation program in New Zealand. But after a fruitless five-month job search, she took a 20-hour-a-week position as a fragrance assistant at Macy's, making minimum wage. She moved into her parents' basement in Marshall, Mich. In April, 2014, she finally secured a job in her field as a lead horticulturist at a zoo. The job provided benefits, but paid only $12 an hour — still not enough for her to have her own place. It used to be that students looked upon college graduation with excitement — the beginning of a road full of promise and, ultimately, an exciting new career. But for many college graduates these days, it's quite the opposite. Despite a national unemployment rate of 3.7 percent, about the lowest it's been in 50 years, many young adults lack job prospects that mesh with their idealized vision of the post-college world. In 2018, 23 percent of those ages 25 to 29 were living in their parents' home, up from 17 percent in 2007, according to the National Center for Family and Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University. Crippling student loan debt often forces young people to move back home. According to the Pew Research Center, 53 percent of those with a bachelor's degree or higher have student loans and a quarter of those with debt owed $43,000 or more. A 2015 study by Jennifer Copp, an assistant professor at Florida State University, found that returning to a parent's home was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms among young adults experiencing employment problems. Maria Kefalas, a professor at St. Joseph's University who was part of the MacArthur Foundation's Research Network on the Transition to Adulthood, said moving back home creates a domino effect. ""If you can't afford your own place, you limit your job search to the opportunities in driving distance of your family home."" Courtship becomes challenging when you live in your parents' basement, she said. Dr. Kefalas has observed an increase in the number of recent college graduates who are having difficulty transitioning into the post-college world. She said some students are not using college effectively; many show up in the career office for the first time in their senior year, without immersing themselves in experiences throughout their college years that prepare them for the job market. A 2017 survey by Strada Education Network and Gallup of 32,000 students at 43 four-year institutions found that the vast majority of students feel unprepared to get a job after graduation; only a third of students believe they will graduate with the skills they need to succeed in the workplace, while just half believe their major will lead to a good job. Diane Hudson, director of the Certified Professional Career Coach Program, a certification of the Professional Association of Resume Writers & Career Coaches, said recent graduates today often lack the interpersonal skills needed to land a job. Reliance on social media and limited experience with face-to-face interaction means they no longer know ""how to properly shake a hand or look somebody in the eye. They have to learn social skills later."" Natascha F. Saunders, a career coach specializing in teens and adults who is based in Boston, said over-involved parents can hamper a job search. She recalls one parent who showed up with her child at a job interview. Ms. Saunders insisted she wait in the lobby, but the parent approached her daughter right afterward and wanted to know exactly what happened: what was said, what questions were asked and how she responded to those questions. Ms. Saunders said she has also seen parents attend career networking events geared to students and alumni. ""The parents mean well,"" she said. ""They want the best for their child, but their actions aren't helpful."" Maureen Tillman, a clinical social worker in Maplewood, N.J. who started College With Confidence & Beyond, a professional practice to help young adults become emotionally and financially independent after graduation, says many recent college graduates do not have resiliency skills ""as a result of being bubble-wrapped in high school and college"" by parents who want to protect them. Resilience is key in a stressful job market. Even though the unemployment rate for bachelor's degree recipients ages 20 to 29 is at 8.3 percent, the lowest it's been since 2007, Dr. Kefalas has seen ""disturbing trends in underemployment and stagnating wages."" The salaries her students earn after college aren't much higher than they were a decade ago. Competition for jobs can be fierce. On average, 250 people will apply for a job through a campus recruiting event. ""Hundreds of students are vying for one entry-level role. Employers are demanding more of the potential applicants. It's tough to get that particular job,"" Ms. Saunders said. Ms. Hanway can attest to that situation. Looking to better her credentials and increase her job prospects, she received a master's degree in environmental management at Duke University in May. ""I needed my bachelor's to get a job and my master's to get a job I could actually live on,"" she said. She applied for 40 jobs — she was one of 150 applicants for one she didn't get — but secured only four interviews. It doesn't help that many college graduates have set the bar high. Since childhood, many have internalized the self-esteem building message that they can do anything and should not settle. ""With that comes anxiety around whether they're doing enough or whether a job is good enough,"" said Kit Yarrow, a professor emeritus of psychology at Golden Gate University in San Francisco. Jeffrey Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., and author of ""Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties,"" observes that ""young people today have this universal aspiration to find a job that's more than just a way to make a living that is different than previous generations."" They're seeking a position that reflects their identity and aligns with their values, he said. But ""employers don't create jobs to fulfill a person's identity. They just need someone to do the job, so there's often a mismatch."" Ms. Hanway only applied for jobs that she felt would make a positive impact on the world. ""It limits your pool and they're lower paying, but it's still more moral than making a ton of money on Wall Street,"" she said. Young adults who are struggling aren't helped by the barrage of heavily curated social media posts that make it seem as if so many peers are succeeding, said Dr. Brian Primack, director of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health. He said nearly all young people use social media, and a study he published in 2017 showed those who use it often were the most lonely. A young adult who is in a more vulnerable state because of financial issues, a bad breakup or another kind of loss has a ""skewed perspective that is more likely to affect their sense of connectedness"" and potentially result in depression, anxiety and other problematic outcomes, he said. The takeaway of a vulnerable person scrolling through social media is often, ""I'm not having as happy and successful a life as all these people,"" he said. Despite the gloomy statistics, Dr. Arnett said he was heartened by findings in the Clark University Poll of Emerging Adults, a national survey he directs of 1,000 young adults ages 18 to 29, in which 89 percent said they were confident that they would eventually get what they wanted out of life. Dr. Kefalas agrees that it's not so much a failure to launch among young people today; it's a delayed launch. Life is looking less bleak these days for Ms. Hanway, now 28. In September, she finally got her dream job, as a science writer at her alma mater. She's now earning a salary of $52,000 plus full benefits. The day before her job started, she finally moved out of her parents' basement into a one-bedroom apartment.  ""It was a lot of work, but I did finally get there,"" she said."

One was the crisis of 2008, after which a lot of ordinary Americans turned their attention to the financial-services industry and discovered something that looked, on the surface, uncannily like a classic bilking: There was a lot of hard-to-follow shifting about of who owned what and who owed what to whom, and in the end a lot of people found that their retirement savings had vanished. The other was the election of Donald Trump, who has always been fairly open about his talent for old-school hucksterism. To the very end, many people were convinced his entire campaign had been a long-game self-promotional exercise — a man wandering past real estate, casinos, reality television, mail-order steaks and wealth-building seminars to arrive at right-wing politics as a high-quality grift. ""Grift"" and ""grifter"" are old-fashioned words, but ever more useful ones. ""Grift"" evokes not so much specific criminal acts as a broad, opportunistic racket, executed with a bit of cunning and panache. ""Grifter"" captures the kind of person who takes up such ploys as a trade, an art, a way of being. Both labels are constantly attached to Trump and his retinue. This year, Salon labeled the president the ""grifter in chief,"" and the late-night host Seth Meyers called him ""a grifter who surrounds himself with other grifters."" A Daily Beast headline gallantly allowed that ""Trump Is Not a 'Moron' — He's a Grifter, and He's Created an Administration of Grifters."" Representative Ted Lieu of California warned of the steady ""drip, drip, drip of grifting from Trump's appointees,"" and when Forbes looked into Wilbur Ross's business history, it concluded that ""the current United States secretary of commerce could rank among the biggest grifters in American history."" In Slate, Jacob Weisberg invented a parlor game to keep things straight: Which administration figures were grifters, and which were grafters? Grafters are stolid and conventional, lining their pockets and then quietly retreating to one of their several homes. Grifters are the ones with flair and ambition, who seem to delight in the con itself — the cleverness of the scheme, the smooth ease with which the marks were gulled. The grifter is a lot more entertaining, and this summer, con stories seemed to be everywhere — not because of any sudden renaissance of fraud, but because the media had tapped into a bottomless appetite for hearing about it. The blockbuster was the tale of Anna Sorokin, a.k.a. Anna Delvey, a European 20-something who managed to persuade New York socialites that she was a wealthy heiress, living out of Manhattan hotels on, reportedly, a series of forged documents and an air of general blitheness. (Both Shonda Rhimes and Lena Dunham are at work on TV adaptations.) And this was nearly nothing compared with Anthony Gignac, an orphan who spent decades impersonating a Saudi prince. According to an October story in Vanity Fair, he was exposed when, during the slow negotiation of a multimillion-dollar business deal, he raised suspicions by ordering prosciutto. The appeal of these stories is hardly mysterious. There you are, stuck at work, while others somehow declare themselves to be billionaires or airline pilots or Stanley Kubrick. We admire the gall, and often the craft — the cinematic complexity of a well-developed con, whether it involves high-wire role-playing or just chiseling petty cash out of passers-by. If you ever feel like the old-fashioned grift has gone the way of fast-talking men in hats and three-card Monte on street corners — the way of Harold Hill in ""The Music Man,"" commencing his 1912 grift with a rousing patter song about moral decay — all you have to do is Google terms along the lines of ""elaborate Walmart returns scheme"" to witness the American ingenuity still on offer. It was a treat to read the story, this summer, of how a security worker for the McDonald's Monopoly contest spent years filching winning tokens and finding co-conspirators to redeem them. We deplore this stuff, in theory, but under the right circumstances we are entranced by the audacity — at the hacker's skill of spotting the weak spots in the systems that bind the rest of us, and bluffing straight through them. A grift needn't be a crime. That's part of the word's appeal: It opens its arms to encompass any phenomenon that arrives in the rough shape of a racket, from online marketing to whole political movements. On the news site Splinter, the writer Alex Pareene has characterized much of modern conservatism as a grift gone wrong — pulling from the historian Rick Perlstein's 2012 Baffler article ""The Long Con,"" which traces out just how much of the movement's far-right fringe was born and nurtured in self-enriching direct-mail and media operations. The game here is simple: Persuade people that everything they value is under attack, and they can be soaked for donations; feed them conspiracy theories about the Federal Reserve and civil unrest, and they will become extraordinarily receptive to ads for bunker supplies and gold. A solid scheme, Pareene suggests, right up until you find that you've overagitated the marks, and they've started deciding party primaries. The personality type that responds to this sort of thing is, naturally, not restricted to the right. Trump's election opened the field for a parallel play among liberals, spurring the rise of the ""Resistance grifter"" — a type of social-media personality who shovels forth alarmist news and wild speculation about the president's perfidy, posing as a lonely hero standing against it and raking in donations or subscription money along the way. Telling people what they wanted to hear used to be part of the average grift; lately, thanks to social media and crowdfunding, it works beautifully as a grift in itself. Even if what you tell the world is sincere, something happens once you've started profiting from it — someone's bound to think you're playing everyone. After that article in July recapped the details of the 1990s Monopoly-token scheme, a few readers were offended to learn that its author was fed the idea by a film producer, who is now co-producing a big-money adaptation of the article — the same strategy he had used with high-profile films before. Was that a bit of a feint? This is the thing about grift-logic: It immediately radiates outward, by analogy, from literal scams to broad systems that merely have the same sensibility as a scam. Selling fake stereo equipment is a classic con; you can call the police about it. Selling iffy nutritional supplements, or tricking people into endless monthly payments on an impulse-buy rotisserie, is a touch safer; they'd have to write letters to the state attorney general. Clickbait publishers, unaccredited online education, apps that quietly harvest personal data, shady Amazon drop-shippers, patent trolls — these can all be legal, but what difference does it make? Once you begin to identify such arrangements as grifts, you are bound to discover, in our baroquely capitalist society, that loads of things are essentially grift-shaped, from oddball start-ups to arcane financial services: They begin with a slick appeal, go on to create nothing of concrete value and end, like any good bilking, with your money in new pockets. This line of thinking can, pretty obviously, be a glib one; to say something like ""capitalism is a grift"" is to express an intuition, not file a detailed indictment. Grift is capacious. In just five characters, it can casually point out the suspect mechanics and empty, grasping heart of almost any figure or phenomenon. Young people look at their paychecks and suspect that their college educations were a grift, or at least the student loans were. One Twitter skeptic smells grift in all of ""the business world,"" another in the artificial scarcity of diamonds, another in all skin care beyond sunscreen and acne medication, another in liberal podcasts, another in ""everything."" This might scan as terminally cynical, a way of sneering diffidently at, well, everything. But it's not exactly outlandish (or unpopular) for a modern person to note that many of the systems she encounters have been carefully constructed to extract maximum profits, to sustain themselves, to get what they can while the getting is good — not unusual for a modern person to suspect it would be easier to deal with an actual con artist than with Wells Fargo or a budget health-insurance company. And perhaps this is cause for despair. But over the course of the year, it has begun to feel that the energy behind calling everything a grift is the very opposite of jaded. You just need to turn your focus from the grift to the negative space around it. If huge segments of our economic activity manage to feel — aesthetically, if not legally — like fine-tuned rackets, then the segments that remain must consist of actual work with actual purpose, productive labor that requires no puffery or misdirection to sustain. This is the surprisingly wholesome, traditionalist set of values that sneering at grift inevitably pushes you toward: old-timey rectitude and integrity, honest work and firm handshakes and mutual respect. The opposite of a grift, you find, is creating things of real value, paying fair wages, asking what is right more than what is profitable. The opposite of grift is a square deal."
News,2018-12-04,"ELIZABETHTOWN, N.C. — L. McCrae Dowless Jr. should have been celebrating. It was 2016, and he had just been elected as a soil and water conservation district supervisor in rural Bladen County, N.C. But he instead came before the State Board of Elections to fan fears of fraud and to air a protest about a race in which he had been victorious.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/us/politics/north-carolina-election-fraud.html,1459," ELIZABETHTOWN, N.C. — L. McCrae Dowless Jr. should have been celebrating. It was 2016, and he had just been elected as a soil and water conservation district supervisor in rural Bladen County, N.C. But he instead came before the State Board of Elections to fan fears of fraud and to air a protest about a race in which he had been victorious. ""I'm not saying there's any wrongdoing here,"" Mr. Dowless told the Raleigh-based board. ""I just want it investigated because it was a high volume of write-ins."" Only two years later, Mr. Dowless has gone from a Republican gadfly in North Carolina's incessant battles over voting rules and alleged fraud to being at the center of an escalating battle over disputed ballots that could overturn the House election in the Ninth Congressional District. Mr. Dowless, witnesses and party officials said, helped to oversee a voter turnout operation on behalf of the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, in which canvassers collected absentee ballots directly from residents — a violation of North Carolina law. Sworn statements from voters and unusual absentee voting statistics have stoked suspicions over whether ballots were fraudulently filled out for Mr. Harris or discarded if they were for his Democratic rival, Dan McCready. State regulators have refused to certify the preliminary results, which showed Mr. Harris with a 905-vote edge. If state officials find that the balloting was tainted enough to ""cast doubt"" on the results, they would have the power to order a new election. The dispute — and the identity of the Ninth District's next congressman — may not be settled for weeks. On Tuesday, Representative Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who is the incoming House majority leader, suggested that Democrats might refuse to seat Mr. Harris if concerns about the election remain. ""If there is what appears to be a very substantial question on the integrity of the election, we would oppose Mr. Harris being seated until that is resolved,"" said Mr. Hoyer, whose chamber has the constitutional authority to be ""the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members."" The House will likely take some of its cues from the findings of the sprawling inquiry that has begun in North Carolina, where elections regulators are poised to hold an evidentiary hearing this month. Investigators have prepared a batch of subpoenas, including one that they sought to serve Tuesday on the Charlotte-area consulting group that contracted with Mr. Dowless. They have questioned people about what Joshua Malcolm, who was named this week as the election board's chairman, described last week as ""claims of numerous irregularities and concerted fraudulent activities."" The known claims are concentrated in Bladen County, which has about 33,000 residents, and neighboring, far larger Robeson County. Bladen County, where elections officials work in a simple brick-and-glass building on South Cypress Street, just behind a shopping center with a Dollar General and a furniture store, recorded the state's highest rate of absentee ballot requests: 7.5 percent of registered voters, compared with less than 3 percent in most of the other 99 counties. A strikingly large number of those ballots, 40 percent, were never returned. In Robeson County, 62 percent were not returned. No other county had a rate higher than 27 percent. Mr. Harris won 61 percent of submitted absentee ballots in Bladen County, even though registered Republicans accounted for only 19 percent of the ballots submitted. Those statistics, coupled with the alleged and acknowledged machinations of Mr. Dowless, who has a felony record and a history of financial fraud, and his workers sparked what slowly swelled into another bitter electoral impasse in a state that seems perpetually engulfed by them. On Tuesday, the district attorney for the area, Jon David, said law enforcement officials were investigating allegations related to the 2016 elections and were in contact with each other ""to coordinate our efforts should a prosecution be warranted"" in the wake of this year's suspicions. Almost all the worries, for now, involve absentee ballots. In an affidavit, a Bladen County resident, Emma Shipman, wrote that she had recently handed over her ballot to a woman who told her that she was assigned to collect ballots in the district. Another voter wrote that she gave her incomplete ballot to a woman who promised she would finish it. State officials are also reviewing other claims. Mr. Malcolm, the elections board chairman, said Tuesday that the authorities would release documents on ""a rolling basis in a manner reasonably calculated to serve the public interest without compromising the investigation."" Perhaps no figure is more central to that inquiry — or the subject of more rumors and speculation — than Mr. Dowless, who was assigned to get-out-the-vote efforts in the eastern part of the Ninth District, which runs from Charlotte to east of Fayetteville. Mr. Dowless, 62, could not be reached for comment, and Red Dome Group, which hired him for Mr. Harris's campaign, did not respond to messages. Mr. Harris has said he will ""support any efforts to investigate allegations of irregularities and/or voter fraud, as long as it is fair and focuses on all political parties."" And although Republicans have threatened litigation to try to compel the state to certify the election results immediately, they have yet to bring a lawsuit. In enlisting Mr. Dowless, the Harris campaign's consultants signed on a man with some political knowledge but a blemished personal history. He was deeply familiar with the get-out-the-vote efforts on which candidates at all levels rely: State records show that beginning in 2009, at least seven Democratic and Republican candidates paid him for work in local and state races, including campaigns for the Legislature, district attorney and county sheriff. Separately, campaign finance records in Mecklenburg County showed that Mr. Dowless worked for a City Council candidate in Charlotte, the state's largest city. ""He was just a known figure,"" said former State Representative Ken Waddell, a Democrat who hired Mr. Dowless after receiving a recommendation. ""To me, it appeared like he just liked politics."" Mr. Waddell had no complaints about Mr. Dowless's integrity during the campaign, but recalled disagreements about where to place signs in the district. Years earlier, though, Mr. Dowless's character had come into question after one of his employees died in an automobile accident. The Fayetteville Observer reported in 1991 that Mr. Dowless and the woman he eventually married had, after the employee's death, taken out a six-figure life insurance policy in the man's name by forging a signature and backdating a document. Mr. Dowless listed himself as the primary beneficiary and collected benefits. Mr. Dowless was eventually sentenced to a short prison term, and state records show convictions for, among other offenses, perjury and fraud. But after prison, Mr. Dowless pursued, at least in part, a life in politics. As a Democrat, he sought a seat on the local school board in 2014 and was defeated in a primary. He was unaffiliated when he ran for the soil and water conservation district board in 2016 and switched his party registration to Republican after the election. The election results, though, had raised concerns in and around Bladen County. Although Mr. Dowless was running unopposed, about a third of the vote went to write-in candidates. Encouraged and aided by the chairman of the county Republican Party at the time, he submitted a protest to the state and argued that there was ""a pattern of fraudulent ballots."" But Mr. Dowless did not appear to know all that much about it when the state elections board convened a hearing. Asked for the name of the lawyer who helped him to prepare his protest, Mr. Dowless recalled him only as ""Steve."" (The lawyer also represented Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican whose bid for re-election would soon end in a narrow defeat.) Asked whether he knew how to obtain the financial disclosure reports of the political action committee that he, in his protest, had suggested was behind ""a massive scheme to run an absentee ballot mill,"" Mr. Dowless said he did not. At one point, a member of the board pointedly asked, ""Are you familiar with your protest?"" Mr. Dowless, who invoked the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination when he chose not to answer a question, said that he was. The board's questioning eventually raised concerns about Mr. Dowless's own efforts to pursue absentee ballots in 2016 and prompted the attention of law enforcement officials. The board dismissed the protest because of ""a lack of substantial evidence of a violation of election law or other irregularity or misconduct sufficient to cast doubt on the results of the election."" The same standard will apply now, as the state board, itself jolted and upended by political turbulence in recent years, decides how to referee North Carolina's latest electoral storm."
News,2018-12-04,"I work at a nonprofit that advocates for consumer rights and financial literacy, a mission I have been proud to serve. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/magazine/should-a-nonprofit-splurge-on-management.html,1132," I work at a nonprofit that advocates for consumer rights and financial literacy, a mission I have been proud to serve.  We recently suffered a financial crisis of our own. Due to changing federal policies, among other factors, we lost a chunk of our annual budget. Management decided to cut about a quarter of the staff to protect our long-term future.  I was of course saddened by what happened, but I understood that there were no good options. Then a staff member who was laid off (and quickly found a new job) told me that senior managers' salaries made up nearly a quarter of the budget and that we were paying for a ""company car"" for our president. In addition, a former manager is paid an exorbitant hourly rate for consulting.  All of this hurt to hear. Our leaders sacrificed dozens of direct-service jobs that impact our clients' lives but seemingly not their own relatively large salaries and fringe benefits. I am considering quitting in protest. (I am sure that the board is aware of the pay structure, so I doubt they will be of help.) I have also considered informing the media, but I don't know what the ethical response is to what I see as an injustice to our fired colleagues and a violation of our mission. Name Withheld Our economy is warmly solicitous toward people at the top of the income hierarchy, icily indifferent toward those in the middle and at the bottom. The Economic Policy Institute says that last year the C.E.O.s of the largest 350 companies in the United States were paid on average 300 times as much as their average employee. And the nonprofit sector, given that it competes for talent with the for-profit sector, isn't going to be entirely exempt from the trend. Your organization is obliged to serve its mission as well as it can with the resources it can muster. To do so, it needs good staff and good management — which requires it to be mindful of what the market rate is for people with the skills it needs. (Nonprofits typically do comparative analyses of salaries in their sector when considering raises for top management.) At the same time, income is just one factor that draws employees; often staff members will work for less when they find the work genuinely rewarding. Especially given the particular mission of your nonprofit, the situation sounds worrisome, and it might indeed have been a good idea to appeal to those at the top to accept cuts in salary in order to reduce the number of frontline employees who were let go. It might also have been better to end a consulting contract than to fire a permanent employee. Both would be harder than layoffs at the bottom, because board members are likely to be personally closer to senior managers (and former managers) than to other employees. Still, it's their responsibility to weigh such options. None of these considerations, however, prove that the leadership made the wrong decision. When the budget shrinks, personnel decisions have to take account of the employment market. Suppose cutting your president's perks or pay would incline her to take a job elsewhere. (Though that car sounds like something most places wouldn't offer.) The cost to your organization of finding a new one, especially during a rocky period, might mean that it wasn't worth the risk. A fixed, across-the-board reduction in salary, defined in percentage terms, might simply produce an organization full of disgruntled people waiting for a better opportunity. It's conceivable, too, that the core competences of the organization lie in the best-paid people and that the less well paid would be easier to replace if and when funds return. You should feel free to talk to the media if you've determined that a nonprofit devoted to financial literacy has made bad financial decisions. But to know that, you would have to be privy to the details. Are you? You say that senior managers ""seemingly"" didn't cut their own earnings — which makes it sound as if you might not be. The inequality in rewards between top and bottom is ultimately a structural problem that requires structural solutions. Several countries in Europe have chosen to deal with it by having higher taxes and more generous transfers to the less well off than we do, ensuring that their income inequality is much less than ours. Those lower-paid people laid off by your organization would have better unemployment insurance there, too. My point here is that the issues you raise aren't really local to your organization. If we want to do something about them, resigning in protest from your nonprofit probably isn't the answer. I was on a three-month study-abroad program for about a month before I changed my ticket to leave within a week. My partner's mother was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer a few weeks before I left for my trip. The treatment did not appear to be working, and the cancer continued to spread.  My partner and I have been together for three years, and before I left, I promised that if things got worse, I would come home. I made good on that promise, but I feel incredibly guilty. I feel guilty for leaving my program early because my parents paid for it, and I am unlikely to get a refund. My partner's mother was also upset that I came home early, but I felt a responsibility to support my partner and make her my priority. I feel like I let my professors and parents down, that I was playing into the stereotype of a young adult making hasty decisions. My father was incredibly supportive, but I still feel anxious. I know I could never have enjoyed myself there with the worry and sadness I was feeling for my significant other. Did I do the right thing? Name Withheld Love is a mode of care, the philosopher Harry Frankfurt has argued, that shapes your preferences and guides your conduct via ""a practical concern for what is good for the beloved."" To feel love for someone is to take his or her interests as your own. It doesn't answer to reasons; rather, in Frankfurt's formula, ""it creates reasons."" The moral nature of love, accordingly, may require sacrifices. Even if — as realism requires me to point out — your partner may not end up permanently in your life, such calculations are going to be alien to who you are as a loving person. Yes, the human and financial costs to you and your family will be substantial, but nothing you are doing involves irreversible loss. Your partner's mother, who is perhaps feeling guilty for derailing your studies, may second-guess you. But your father hasn't. And neither will I."

And then the death of George H.W Bush — the only presidential candidate whose campaign I volunteered for (as a letter-stuffer in 1988) — reminded me that there was a time when our presidents were dignified, presidential, decent and public-spirited. Does Bush's passing cause you to rethink the way you viewed him when he was in office? Gail Collins: I realized a long time ago I'd underestimated him — maybe when I started comparing him to his son, the walking foreign policy disaster. And now, of course, every former president looks great compared with Donald Trump. If Warren Harding had died this week, we'd all have been thinking: ""Well sure his Secretary of the Interior went to jail, but compared to Donald Trump …"" Bret: Agreed. James Baker was right when he said Bush 41 was the best one-term president we've ever had. The largely peaceful collapse of the Soviet Union. The successful reunification of Germany. Lightning victory in the gulf war. The end of the Noriega regime in Panama. The negotiation of NAFTA. The Americans with Disabilities Act. Also, the complete absence of malice. Bush 41 was probably the last president who refused to govern in a state of remorseless partisan war with his opponents. Obviously that wasn't true of his political campaigns, particularly against Mike Dukakis in 1988, but it did typify his time in office. It's almost hard to imagine that we could recover that style of politics. With that in mind, what are you looking forward to when Democrats take over the House come January? Gail: Infrastructure. Lots and lots of talk about infrastructure. One of the very few things both parties in Congress and the president agree on is that infrastructure is … good. Don't know that they'll get any farther than that, but if anything happens I'm thinking it'll be about road repair. Here in New York we have a desperate, critical need to get a new train tunnel under the Hudson River. The existing ones are in terrible shape and if either ever has to be closed down, it'll be a major blow to the economy of the city, the region and the country. So far Trump just hasn't gotten on board. Reliable sources tell me it's because he doesn't want to pay a lot of money for something people can't see. Anything you hope Congress will or won't do? Bret: An immigration bill. But, yeah, infrastructure first. I say this with some reluctance, ideologically speaking. I think a lot of huge infrastructure projects are boondoggles of dubious long-term economic value — even if they create jobs while they are being built. And, as we've learned from the Second Avenue subway misadventure, it's easy to inflate costs massively when the taxpayer is footing the bill and government isn't controlling the costs. That said, every time I go through Penn Station I'm reminded of how awful our rail lines are next to every other developed country. And any time I fly from JFK to Hong Kong or another Asian destination I feel as if I'm departing from the 20th century and arriving in the 22nd. So, yes, infrastructure. Gail: I've always suspected that many conservatives hate mass transit because it just fundamentally offends their sense of individualism. That you can't be the heroic American Man Who Rides Alone if you're sitting in a car with 40 other people making multiple stops in New Jersey. But go on. Bret: There's more than a little something to that. As for immigration, I liked our colleague Tom Friedman's formulation from his column the other day: ""A high wall with a big gate."" Not because I think the wall is such a great idea — the money would be better spent on personnel and technology, not concrete — but because I think it is a price worth paying for a path to citizenship for the Dreamers, an expanded H1-B program for high-skilled immigrants and their spouses, and other steps to make immigration to the United States fairer, safer and easier for every law-abiding person who wants to come and make this a better country. Gail: Good luck getting that past the president. And if we want to resolve the border issues, there's also going to have to be a very big effort to fuel economic development in Central America. This really isn't a problem about Mexicans anymore so much as impoverished refugees from the violence and hunger of countries like Honduras. Bret: Agreed. We need some version of a ""Plan Colombia"" for Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, modeled on the military and financial assistance the United States gave to Bogotá that successfully helped Colombians get the upper hand against insurgents and drug cartels. And that's another one for the ""good luck getting it past the president"" file. Gail: But here's something I've been meaning to ask you about: the report on global warming. The president just won't buy the idea that it's happening. I suspect that's why he was so nuts about the California fires — he was babbling about raking the forests because he didn't want to go near the real issue. We haven't talked about global warming in a long time. Any reactions? Bret: Given the topic, I guess the first thing I should say, yet again, is that I do not dispute the science that climate change is happening and that much of it is man-made. And Trump and his administration should simply acknowledge the fact. I'm less clear, say, that we should attribute events like the devastating forest fires to climate change alone as opposed to a host of additional causes, including too many people living in fire-prone areas (and often causing the fires), as well as poor forest-management practices. I'm also skeptical that we have any genuinely practical solutions right now to climate change — at least solutions that don't create environmental or political problems of their own. ""Do something"" may be an emotionally satisfying statement, but it's a lousy guide to policy. I was reminded of this the other while reading a fascinating piece in The Times Magazine about the ecological devastation wrought by biofuels — which were seen as part of the climate-change cure just a few years ago. The riots in France sparked by the government's climate-related hike to diesel fuel taxes are also a reminder that the term ""climate sensitivity"" should be a political term as well as an ecological one. Gail: It's true that overdevelopment is one of the causes of the California fires — as well as all the terrible flooding in places like Florida and Texas. Interesting that the president never mentions that. Bret: We could do a lot to discourage people from living in places they shouldn't be in the first place, for instance by ending or reforming the National Flood Insurance Program. Gail: Totally agree about the flood insurance. But not about your suggestion that just saying ""Do something"" is the worst possible response to global warming concerns. Worst possible response is to gut the existing regulations and then just say, ""Wait and see."" Bret: Agree partially. The ethanol subsidies have been a fiasco. Cap-and-trade systems are prone to corruption. A carbon tax probably makes the most sense but tends to be regressive. My own view is that reinvesting in nuclear plants makes the most sense from an environmental and technological point of view, so long as you can reform the regulatory picture to make them economical. Gail: If you're worried about solutions that create problems of their own, there's the one about getting rid of the radioactive waste. One of the reasons I'm in the ""Do something"" camp is because there are plenty of strategies that would be helpful even if they didn't turn out to do much over the long run for the global warming. We already mentioned mass transit, controlling overdevelopment of beaches and other fragile areas. Reducing car emissions makes the air better. Encouraging the solar heating industry and wind power gives us an economic boost. And if I go on I will wind up once again pointing out that the worst possible approach is the one the president is taking — overturning the existing anti-warming regulations and shrugging his shoulders as if the whole issue was slightly less important than the weekend golfing schedule. We spend a lot of time jointly beating up on Trump: Is there anything he's doing that you'd want to praise with a little holiday-season cheer? Bret: Let me think …. …. thinking. …. thinking. Ah, O.K. Well, he didn't completely wreck free trade this week, though the new NAFTA is worse than the old one and it isn't clear it can get congressional approval. So I guess I'm mildly cheered that he has almost prevented a disaster he needlessly caused. What about you? Anything to like? Gail: Well … I do appreciate he doesn't come back to New York for weekends any more. We've got enough traffic jams from the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. Speaking of trees, I have to admit I've never been more fascinated with White House holiday decorations than this year. Those blood-red pseudo-firs are truly memorable. And sort of perfect for an administration that so frequently makes the nation go, ""Yipes!"" Bret: This is the new third-rail of American politics: Melania. And Melania's taste. For reasons I don't quite get, liberals and conservatives seem to have made some kind of tacit pact not to criticize her or her choices as first lady. They weren't so kind to Hillary Clinton. But here goes: that was the tackiest White House Christmas display ever. Of all time. It looked to me as if Derek Zoolander had been brought in as style consultant. And that he, in turn, had subcontracted the task to Imelda Marcos. It looked like a staging for an avant-garde version of Federico García Lorca's ""Bodas de Sangre."" It looked — if looks could sing — as if ""White Christmas"" were being performed by Ozzy Osbourne just as he bit the head off a bat. It looked as if John Bolton had been chosen to perform an exorcism, sadly not on the president. Otherwise: pure class! Gail: O.K., that is the best interior decorating critique of the year. On the Trump plus side, the National Football League will be happy to know that, thanks to the president, I have developed a modest affection for professional sports. You have to live in Trumpland all week, but on the weekends you can turn it all off and watch people tossing balls around. You go to a party and rather than depressing everybody with talk of the latest tweets, you can just say ""Hey, how about those Giants?"" Or Rams or Bears or whatever animal mascot you like. Bret: Poor Bears. Shoulda beaten the Giants on Sunday. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
News,2018-12-04,"BRUSSELS — In a major speech on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to explain one of the abiding conundrums of the Trump administration: How does a nationalist lead on the international stage?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/world/europe/pompeo-brussels-speech.html,1104," BRUSSELS — In a major speech on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to explain one of the abiding conundrums of the Trump administration: How does a nationalist lead on the international stage? The answer, he said, is to revamp or jettison some treaties and institutions while bolstering others. Among the institutions that Mr. Pompeo criticized were the United Nations, the European Union, the Organization of American States and the African Union. But he embraced NATO, which President Trump has harshly criticized, as an ""indispensable institution."" The speech, delivered in a palatial hall in Brussels, was intended to explain Mr. Trump's worldview to a deeply skeptical audience, including many Europeans who see Mr. Trump as undermining international agreements that have kept the peace in Europe and enhanced prosperity. ""Even our European friends sometimes say we're not acting in the free world's interest. This is just plain wrong,"" Mr. Pompeo said, adding that ""under President Trump, we are not abandoning international leadership or our friends in the international system. Indeed, quite the contrary."" But since the end of the Cold War, the international order ""failed us, and it failed you,"" he said. ""Multilateralism has become viewed as an end unto itself. The more treaties we sign, the safer we supposedly are. The more bureaucrats we have, the better the job gets done."" Of the United Nations, he asked, ""Does it continue to serve its mission faithfully?"" Mr. Pompeo called Britain's decision to leave the European Union a ""political wake-up call"" for the bloc, which is based in Brussels. He then asked whether the European Union ""is ensuring that the interests of countries and their citizens are placed before those of bureaucrats here in Brussels?"" Someone in the audience shouted an unequivocal, ""Yes,"" a response Mr. Pompeo ignored. The World Bank, International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization also came in for sharp criticism. ""International bodies must help facilitate cooperation that bolsters the security and values of the free world, or they must be reformed or eliminated,"" he said. After the short speech, Mr. Pompeo took no questions. Responses ranged from tepid to hostile. In addition to Mr. Trump's regular criticism of NATO, the United States and the European Union are fiercely at odds over the Iran nuclear deal, which Mr. Trump has pulled out of while America's main European allies seek to preserve it. Washington and Brussels are also engaged in sometimes vicious negotiations about trade as well as American sanctions on European steel on the grounds of ""national security."" The Trump administration is also threatening new tariffs on imported cars, in an effort to reduce the American trade deficit with the European Union. And Washington has sharply criticized Germany for supporting the Nordstream II, a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany now under construction. Mr. Pompeo's challenge to the European Union was a surprisingly undiplomatic comment from America's chief diplomat. A spokesman for the European Union disputed the claim that the bloc fails the member states and their people. Margaritis Schinas, chief spokesman of the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, explained its governing structure and system of popular elections, adding pointedly, ""I'm simplifying for those who do not know us."" ""That's how it works, O.K.?"" Mr. Schinas said, throwing his hands in the air. ""So for those people who come to Brussels and coin an opinion without knowing how our system works, that's how our system works, and that's our reply."" Ian Lesser, director of the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, which organized the event, said: ""Clearly this was a speech intended to signal that multilateralism wasn't dead, it simply needed to be revived."" ""I don't think it was a destructive message about multilateralism per se,"" he said. Some listeners were less sanguine, like David Fouquet, a professor at the Free University of Brussels. ""I was struck by the fact that he put the European Union on his administration's hit list of bad actors,"" he said. ""I'm in disbelief: the tone, the lack of sensitivity to the place where he was."" ""His predecessors built and created these institutions,"" Mr. Fouquet said. ""Although he professes to want to strengthen them, I think he is undermining them."" Mr. Pompeo's audience listened for clues about the future of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, known as the I.N.F. treaty, which the Trump administration has threatened to jettison despite European opposition. For years, American officials have maintained that Russia was violating the treaty, which banned land-based missiles of certain ranges. ""When treaties are broken, the violators must be confronted, and the treaties must be fixed or discarded,"" Mr. Pompeo said, in a preview of a threat he delivered hours later to walk away from the agreement if Russia fails to correct violations. Mr. Lesser said that ""for now I heard no sign suggesting that America is prepared to go back on its apparent commitment to withdraw from the nuclear treaty, unless of course something happens on the Russian side, but I don't think that's very likely."" Mr. Pompeo said that some international institutions ""work in American interests and yours, in service of our shared values."" He listed only three such bodies: NATO, the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, the bank messaging service known as Swift. John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, threatened to penalize Swift, which gives financial institutions a secure way to wire money around the world, if it did not remove Iran's banks from the system. Despite opposition from the European Union, Swift acceded to American demands. ""This is an excellent example of an international institution acting responsibly,"" Mr. Pompeo said. Although NATO also received praise from Mr. Pompeo, he repeated Mr. Trump's frequent complaint that the other 27 nations in the alliance need to spend more on defense. He then announced that he would host foreign ministers in Washington in April to celebrate the alliance's 70th anniversary. It would be the first time that a major NATO birthday was celebrated without heads of state. NATO officials said that there may be another summit meeting of leaders later in the year that could be portrayed as timed for the anniversary. In closing, Mr. Pompeo cited a quote from George Marshall, who as secretary of state after World War II helped design the modern international system, declaring that ""international action cannot replace self-help."" ""It's not popular to buck the status quo,"" Mr. Pompeo said. ""But too much is at stake not to. This is the reality which President Trump so viscerally understands."" ""President Trump knows that when America leads, peace and prosperity follow,"" he added."
News,2018-12-04,Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/business/dealbook/the-weed-industry-may-be-better-off-without-the-support-of-big-tobacco.html,408," Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Big ambitions require investment, but not all infusions of capital are equal. Cronos, the Canadian pot producer, is in early talks with the tobacco giant Altria, Reuters reported on Monday. An association with a huge tobacco company isn't exactly what this nascent industry needs. To say that Cronos has expansion plans is an understatement. It wants to grow its production of weed to more than 258,000 pounds a year — equivalent to just less than $900 million a year in revenue terms, based on its latest realized price per ounce. In the last quarter it sold just 1,133 pounds. That's not to say that the Cronos chief executive Michael Gorenstein can't hit that target — but anyone buying his company's shares, or those of equally driven rivals, is effectively getting some greenhouses and nurseries, supply agreements and a lot of hope. Altria can take that risk. With a stock market capitalization of over $100 billion, it could swallow the $1.8 billion Cronos with virtually no financial impact. (Never mind that Cronos trades at more than 20 times its projected revenue for 2019, according to estimates from the data provider Refinitiv.) And for the tobacco industry, which has more enemies than friends, diversification makes sense — much like Altria's potential investment in the vaping company Juul Labs, reported by The Wall Street Journal last week. The trouble is, cannabis isn't quite like tobacco, nor should it want to be seen that way. Producers aspire for their product to be seen as medicinal rather than lethal, for one. In the future a lot of cannabis won't be smoked but eaten, taken as oils or even applied as cosmetics. Moreover, pot growers would prefer not to be regulated in the same draconian way as tobacco. Canada has already imposed strict curbs on how weed companies present logos and branding. In most U.S. states where usage is legal, a more liberal approach so far prevails. In some cases, weed producers can be selective. Canopy Growth in August announced a $4 billion investment from the brewer Constellation Brands, targeting a North American infused-beverage market that analysts from Berenberg Bank think could be worth $13.2 billion. Others might turn to pharmaceuticals companies, or even personal-goods makers. Tobacco companies have cash and urgency, but their unmistakable aroma is something that Big Weed can do without."
Op-Ed,2018-12-05,"I have this feeling that the 2020 presidential election in the United States will be unlike any in my lifetime — and not only because it will likely involve Donald Trump running as an incumbent — he alone is a one-man, three-ring circus — but also because the huge issue that should have been the focus of the 2016 election will be unavoidable by 2020. That is: How do we govern the “Next America’’?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/opinion/the-next-america.html,1148," I have this feeling that the 2020 presidential election in the United States will be unlike any in my lifetime — and not only because it will likely involve Donald Trump running as an incumbent — he alone is a one-man, three-ring circus — but also because the huge issue that should have been the focus of the 2016 election will be unavoidable by 2020. That is: How do we govern the ""Next America''? ""You know William Gibson's line, 'The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed'? Well, the future is here, and now it's starting to really get distributed. This is the Next America. But our institutions and political parties have not adapted to it,'' Gautam Mukunda, a Harvard Kennedy School Research Fellow and the author of ""Indispensable: When Leaders Really Matter,'' remarked in an interview. By 2020, it will be impossible to ignore the Next America. ""The basic premises of how the economy works have shifted under our feet and the government will have to respond.'' This Next America will raise a whole web of new intertwined policy, legal, moral, ethical and privacy issues because of changes in technology, demographics, the environment and globalization that are reaching critical mass. Where do I start? A good place is with 5G — fifth-generation wireless systems. With the two telecom giants Verizon and AT&T now beginning to deploy 5G technology across the country, the metabolism of business, entertainment, education and health care will dramatically accelerate in the Next America, beginning around … 2020. Getting the most from artificial intelligence and machine learning — like deploying self-driving vehicles — requires quickly transmitting massive amounts of data with very low latency. We will have that capacity in the Next America. With 5G, a Hollywood movie that now takes six or seven minutes to download onto your iPad will take six or seven seconds and microsensors in your shirt will gather intelligence and broadcast vital signs to your doctor. As AT&T notes in one of its 5G ads, ""Think of this as the next frontier in untethering, giving you the ability to take the ultrafast experience you have in your home or business with you virtually anywhere.'' It could be as revolutionary as the internet.  But it will require all kinds of new regulations to govern applications from self-driving cars to drone delivery systems to robots that will work as security guards and home health aides. An Associated Press report on Monday said that the government estimated there were currently ""about 110,000 commercial drones operating in U. S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022.'' All of this new technology will have important implications for the education-to-work pipeline. My friend Heather E. McGowan, a future-of-work strategist, puts it this way: ""The old model of work was three life blocks: Get an education. Use that education for 40 years. And then retire. We then made the faulty assumption that the next new model would be: Get an education. Use it for 20 years. Then get retrained. Then use that for 20 more years and then retire.'' But in fact, in the Next America, argues McGowan, the right model will be ""continuous lifelong learning'' — because when the pace of change is accelerating, ""the fastest-growing companies and most resilient workers will be those who learn faster than their competition."" That means that in addition to our traditional big safety nets — Social Security and Medicare — we will need new national trampolines. We will need to make some level of postsecondary education free to every American who meets a minimum grade and attendance requirement, so that every adult and every high school graduate can earn an associate degree or technical certificate free of tuition at a community college at any time. Tennessee has already done that. These same technological transformations mean the Next America will require changes in antitrust policy. Since the 1980s, antitrust policy judged if a company was getting too big largely by one question: Was the loss of competition hurting consumers through higher prices or fewer services? ""But that definition is increasingly irrelevant in an age in which the most powerful companies in the world offer products and services for 'free' in exchange for personal data,"" Rana Foroohar, the Financial Times technology columnist, noted in a June 24 essay. ""This has provoked calls for a return to the definition of monopoly in the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which emphasizes the need to ensure that the economic power of large companies does not result in the corruption of the political process.'' That's because we are more than consumers, ""we're citizens,'' notes Mukunda, ""We have interests that stretch far beyond consumer pricing, and it's the job of the government to protect citizens' liberty, not just consumers' interests. It says so right in the Constitution, and we've forgotten that.'' Just one person — Mark Zuckerberg — controls Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. The fact that he has shown himself to be much more interested in scaling his platforms than combating those who abused them for political and economic gain — and that his lieutenants were ready to go after their high-profile critics, like George Soros — should make breaking up or regulating Facebook a front-and-center issue in 2020. But just the raw political weight of behemoths like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple needs a closer look. The Next America is more than technology. It literally will be born in 2020. The United States Census Bureau has predicted that by 2020, for the first time, ""more than half of the nation's children are expected to be part of a minority race or ethnic group."" That will begin a process by which by 2044 ""no one racial or ethnic group will dominate the U.S. in terms of size,"" NPR reported. Alas, though, the fiscal tools we need to build the Next America have been weakened by President Trump's tax cuts. The federal deficit was not supposed to hit $1 trillion until 2020, but the White House now says it will hit that number in 2019. We've had deficits this size in response to the 2008 financial crisis, but we've never run one so huge during a boom. That means the Next America may have to be built in the face of higher interest rates on more debt, with less fiscal ammunition to stimulate the economy should it slow down or face a crisis. So the Next America may very likely have to raise taxes or trim military spending, or Social Security or Medicare — just when all the baby boomers are retiring. In sum, the Next America requires addressing each of those issues, and many more — from climate change to zoning rules — and how they interact. So the next election must too. The craziness around Trump has delayed much of this discussion. But 2020 won't let us do that again. The Next America won't wait.

News,2018-12-05,"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — On a wintry day, Michael R. Bloomberg stood in black tassel loafers in melting snow while he inspected solar panels on a rooftop, then said he would make climate change “the issue” of the 2020 presidential race.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/us/politics/bloomberg-iowa-2020.html,930," CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — On a wintry day, Michael R. Bloomberg stood in black tassel loafers in melting snow while he inspected solar panels on a rooftop, then said he would make climate change ""the issue"" of the 2020 presidential race. Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who is mulling a run for president, was blunt about his determination to combat the impact of human activity on the environment, and he made clear once again his willingness to take on the coal industry. ""I've been very active in closing coal-fired power plants,"" Mr. Bloomberg boasted when asked whether a candidate whose top concern is climate change could appeal to voters in the regions like eastern Ohio who helped put President Trump in the White House. While praising Iowa's corn-based ethanol as an intermediary fuel needed in the short run, Mr. Bloomberg said it was well past time to cut coal entirely from the energy picture. ""One thing that shouldn't be part of the mix at all now is coal,"" he said. It was reminiscent of a comment that came to haunt Hillary Clinton in 2016, when she said her policies would put many coal miners out of work — a stance diametrically opposed to that ofMr. Trump, who made reinvigorating the coal industry a centerpiece of his economic message. While touring a company that installs solar panels in Cedar Rapids, Mr. Bloomberg, 76, attacked President Trump's rejection of his administration's own report about the dire economic costs from climate change. ""If you don't believe in science, I don't know what to tell you,"" he said. ""I guess when you need a doctor, you go to a witch doctor or something."" Mr. Bloomberg was making his first foray of the 2020 campaign to Iowa on Tuesday, though he was by no means the earliest bird to the state with the first nominating contest. With the state's caucuses still 14 months away, the website Iowa Starting Line has tracked more than two dozen potential Democratic contenders who have already visited. A billionaire philanthropist, Mr. Bloomberg arrived for four appearances in Iowaafter playing a major financial role in his party's broad midterm successes. The largess included a $250,000 donation to the Iowa Democratic Party for its statewide campaigns, said Matt Paul, an Iowa operative who helped arrange Mr. Bloomberg's visit. Some of Mr. Bloomberg's policies as mayor of New York, such as support for stop-and-frisk policing and opposition to Wall Street regulations, are at cross-purposes with progressives in his party, who have a large influence in Iowa. But Mr. Paul, who directed Mrs. Clinton's Iowa campaign in 2016, played downthose conflicts. He said Iowa Democrats were looking for the candidate who could best make Mr. Trump a one-term president. ""What matters most to them is winning,"" he said. ""I think '16 may have been a race about the résumé; '20 is going to be about victory."" Once a competitive battleground in presidential elections, Iowa was won decisively by Mr. Trump in 2016, sending Democrats into a deep funk. The 2018 midterms brought them partial redemption. Democrats flipped two congressional seats, although their nominee for governor lost to the incumbent Republican, Kim Reynolds. The 2018 election underscored Democrats' weakness outside of major cities and university towns. Pete D'Alessandro, a top Iowa adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 caucuses, said Mr. Bloomberg would not have any problem appealing to progressives. His challenge, like that of all Democratic contenders, would come in second-tier cities like Davenport and Marshalltown, blue-collar strongholds that fell fully under Mr. Trump's sway in 2016. ""Mike Bloomberg would do very well in Des Moines,"" Mr. D'Alessandro said. ""So would Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden or whoever. But how does Mike Bloomberg do in the small cities? ""Is he willing to not get into a limo, but get in a Jeep and drive to Marshalltown? That's a lot of work."" Mr. Bloomberg had a jam-packed schedule on his one-day visit. He toured an electrical contractor that installs solar panels, and met with students at a community college studying wind technology. In the evening he met in Des Moines with Moms Demand Action, the gun-control group he supports financially, and appeared at a preview of a climate change movie he bankrolled, ""Paris to Pittsburgh."" Before he spoke at the screening, Mr. Bloomberg was interrupted by a dozen or so protesters from the Democratic Socialists of America, who accused him of being ""Donald Trump lite"" and insufficiently green because he supports fracking as a transitional option on the road to clean energy. As the protesters were led out by the police, Mr. Bloomberg joked that it was like being back in New York, and said he would meet with them. ""People want recognition and respect,"" he said. ""I'm happy to give them that."" The field of potential 2020 Democrats highlighting climate change as a central issue is crowded. On Monday, Mr. Sanders led a town hall event on the topic that was broadcast on social media from Washington, in which he called global warming ""the great crisis facing our planet and facing humanity."" It is an issue that especially concerns young people, who flexed their muscles in the midterms, turning out in higher numbers than in any off-year election in the past quarter-century, according to one estimate. On the second issue he is most passionate about, gun safety, Mr. Bloomberg took a stance that might make it hard for many moderate Iowans to follow him. ""I think if you have children at home maybe you shouldn't have a gun,"" he said. ""That's just too dangerous."""
News,2018-12-05,"When the first big free-agent domino fell on Tuesday, the biggest surprise was not that Patrick Corbin landed a six-year, $140 million contract, it was the team with which he signed it.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/sports/patrick-corbin-nationals.html,880," When the first big free-agent domino fell on Tuesday, the biggest surprise was not that Patrick Corbin landed a six-year, $140 million contract, it was the team with which he signed it. Corbin, the top pitcher on the market, did not sign with the two suitors close to his hometown in upstate New York: the Philadelphia Phillies, whose owner was prepared to spend ""stupid"" money over the winter, and the Yankees, who have written the book on it. Instead, the Washington Nationals landed Corbin, a 29-year-old left-hander. The Nationals were flush with cash — the expiring contracts of Bryce Harper, Daniel Murphy, Gio Gonzalez and Matt Wieters free nearly $62 million from their payroll — and probably fueled by last season's collapse, they were willing to outbid the competition by adding a sixth year to the offer. Corbin, for his part, also gave a little, allowing the Nationals, as is their habit, to defer some of the money, according to a baseball official familiar with the agreement. The deal sends a signal that is heartening for baseball: At least in the National League East, most everyone is trying to win. The division champion Atlanta Braves landed third baseman Josh Donaldson, the American League Most Valuable Player three years ago, on a one-year, $23 million flier. The Mets acquired an elite closer in Edwin Diaz and an aging middle-of-the-lineup bat in Robinson Cano. And while the Phillies may have lost out on Corbin, they should be in the chase for the premier free agents in this class: Manny Machado and Harper. In Washington, Corbin joins a rotation where he will be third fiddle — behind Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg, who are down for $37 million and $38 million next season. Those are the types of salaries that used to regularly dot the Yankees' ledger. Sometimes it was money well spent (C. C. Sabathia) and sometimes it was not (Jacoby Ellsbury), but the deals had at least one commonality: They reinforced the notion that the only bottom line that mattered was winning the World Series. Now it is no longer so. Fiscal responsibility reigns. The Yankees, though they did take on what remained of Giancarlo Stanton's 13-year, $325 million contract last December, went through financial contortions to stay below the luxury tax threshold for the first time last season. General Manager Brian Cashman has said that he has been given a budget by Hal Steinbrenner, but has declined to say if it is above the new luxury tax threshold of $206 million, which is $9 million more than last season. The Yankees have occasionally lost out on free agents over the years — Greg Maddux didn't care much for New York, and Curt Schilling was intrigued by the possibility of ending the Red Sox playoff drought — but it is exceedingly rare for them to pursue one of the top players on the market and be outbid. About the only example that comes to mind is Cano, whom the Yankees were wary of committing to for 10 years. The Yankees made a similar calculus with Corbin, whom they viewed as a very good pitcher — they had tried to trade for him last winter — but one who had several middling seasons after Tommy John surgery before blossoming last season. He was 11-7 with a 3.15 earned run average, making the All-Star team and finishing fifth in the N.L. Cy Young voting. The Yankees liked Corbin plenty, but they did not view him as a top-of-the-rotation pitcher and thus did not want to give him a sixth year. Their final offer, according to a baseball official familiar with the negotiation, was five years and $100 million. So, instead of reading tea leaves last week — the order of Corbin's visits was Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and the report that Corbin's brother put on a Yankees cap while delivering a toast at Corbin's wedding — it was better to have listened. Cashman was asked on Friday, a day after Corbin's visit, if he was waiting on Corbin as a primary target. ""There's a lot of players of interest to us and a lot of players that can improve us, both in free agency and trade, so I wouldn't designate anyone as a primary,"" Cashman said. ""There's a lot of attractive players that are available for various price points."" Now the Yankees will pivot. Their pursuit of pitching to augment Luis Severino, Masahiro Tanaka and Sabathia already resulted in a trade with Seattle for James Paxton, and will now shift toward the next-level free agents — Dallas Keuchel, Nathan Eovaldi and J. A. Happ — and what could be a robust trade market with Cleveland's Corey Kluber headlining it. Only time will tell if the Yankees were wise not to invest in Corbin. Cashman has been shrewd in rebuilding the Yankees through their farm system, but his reluctance to take on the salary of Justin Verlander two years ago and — to a lesser degree — his unwillingness to part with a prospect like Miguel Andujar to land Gerrit Cole loom as what-ifs. But there was no equivocation about what happened on Tuesday. If this season's Yankees do win the franchise's 28th World Series title, it will not have been at any cost."
News,2018-12-05,"WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser, helped substantially with the special counsel’s investigation and should receive little to no prison time for lying to federal investigators, prosecutors said on Tuesday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/us/politics/michael-flynn-special-counsel-sentencing-memo.html,1316," WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn, President Trump's first national security adviser, helped substantially with the special counsel's investigation and should receive little to no prison time for lying to federal investigators, prosecutors said on Tuesday. Mr. Flynn was a key cooperator who helped the Justice Department with several investigations, prosecutors for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, said. He sat for 19 interviews with Mr. Mueller's office and other prosecutors and handed over documents and communications, they said. ""His early cooperation was particularly valuable because he was one of the few people with long-term and firsthand insight"" into the subject of Mr. Mueller's investigation — Russia's election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired, prosecutors wrote in a sentencing recommendation memorandum and an addendum that was heavily blacked out. In particular, they wrote, he might have prompted others to cooperate with the inquiry. ""The defendant's decision to plead guilty and cooperate likely affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming,"" prosecutors said. They also indicated that Mr. Flynn helped with other investigations without revealing details about them. Mr. Flynn, who served briefly as the president's national security adviser, is the only White House aide and the first person from the president's inner circle to strike a cooperation deal with the special counsel's office in exchange for a more lenient penalty. He pleaded guilty a year ago to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time, Sergey I. Kislyak. ""The defendant deserves credit for accepting responsibility in a timely fashion and substantially assisting the government,"" prosecutors wrote. The cases of some other former Trump aides caught up in the special counsel investigation are also nearing resolution, marking an active week for Mr. Mueller's inquiry. By Friday, Mr. Mueller's prosecutors are due to enumerate how they believe Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, violated a plea agreement and separately to outline the extent of cooperation by Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's longtime lawyer and fixer. Another longtime Trump associate whom Mr. Mueller is scrutinizing, Roger J. Stone Jr., said on Tuesday that he had invoked his the Fifth Amendment rights in response to a request from Democratic investigators for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hand over documents and testimony relevant to their own Russia inquiry. Mr. Stone's lawyer, Grant J. Smith, said the committee's request was ""overbroad"" and stressed that Mr. Stone was ""an innocent citizen who denounces secrecy."" The letter was dated Monday, the same day that Mr. Trump praised Mr. Stone on Twitter for having the ""guts"" to stand up to Mr. Mueller. Mr. Stone's lawyer said that the letter was sent before Mr. Trump's tweet. A grand jury in Washington has been investigating whether Mr. Stone had any advance knowledge of how WikiLeaks planned to use documents stolen from Democratic computers by Russian agents during the 2016 presidential campaign. Prosecutors said Mr. Flynn's more than 33 years of military service — he was a three-star Army general before being fired as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 — should be taken into account when Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia sentences him on Dec. 18. But they also noted he should have known better than to lie to the F.B.I. ""Senior government leaders should be held to the highest standards,"" they wrote. Close observers of Mr. Mueller's investigation had hoped his team might provide revealing details about possible cooperation between Trump associates and Russia, but in typical fashion, the special counsel's office kept its cards closely held. Though the lack of details suggested that Mr. Mueller's investigation remains active, one of the president's personal lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, seized on it to underscore that Mr. Mueller had yet to prove any Trump associates conspired with Russia's campaign of disruption. ""This is what we get for $30 million and two years of an investigation and no evidence of collusion, and we get a process charge?"" he said, referring to Mr. Flynn's plea of lying to the F.B.I. and rounding up the estimated costs of the special counsel inquiry. Mr. Flynn, who gained notoriety after he left the military for his view of Islamic terrorism as an existential threat to the United States, began advising the Trump campaign in early 2016. About a week after his surprise election victory, Mr. Trump named Mr. Flynn as his future national security adviser. During the presidential transition, Mr. Flynn discussed with Mr. Kislyak a coming United Nations Security Council vote on whether to condemn Israel's building of settlements. At the time, the Obama administration was preparing to allow a Security Council vote on the matter. The two men also spoke about sanctions imposed by the Obama administration on Russia over its election interference in December 2016. Mr. Flynn asked that Moscow refrain from escalating the situation, and Mr. Kislyak said Russia ""had chosen to moderate its response."" Just days after Mr. Trump's inauguration in January 2017, Mr. Flynn was interviewed by the F.B.I. as part of the investigation into Russia's influence campaign in the 2016 election. During the interview, Mr. Flynn lied to agents, a crime that carries up to five years in prison. At the time, the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned the White House that Mr. Flynn might be compromised by the Russians. Why Mr. Flynn chose to lie about his and Mr. Kislyak's discussions remains a mystery to the F.B.I. officials who investigated the case. Before investigators interviewed Mr. Flynn at the White House, he had indicated to a senior F.B.I. official that he knew the United States had been listening to Mr. Kislyak's calls, former law enforcement officials said. Mr. Mueller's prosecutors gave no indication about why he lied. Mr. Flynn's own memo to seek a light sentence in the case is due by Dec. 11. Mr. Flynn served only 24 days as national security adviser. He was forced to resign as the White House cited his failure to be forthcoming with Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Flynn has largely remained out of news headlines since taking the plea deal a year ago. And Mr. Trump has said little about him since, even as he lashed out at other former aides who agreed to cooperate with investigators in exchange for lighter punishments. ""I've seen it many times,"" the president told ""Fox & Friends"" in August after Mr. Manafort was convicted of financial fraud and Mr. Cohen agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. ""I've had many friends involved in this stuff; it's called flipping, and it almost ought to be illegal. It's not a fair thing."" After being fired  by President Barack Obama in 2014 after repeated clashes with other administration officials about his job performance, Mr. Flynn went on to form his own consulting company. Among his clients was Turkey, which paid him more than a half-million dollars to target Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey believes that Mr. Gulen and his supporters were behind a failed coup attempt in 2016 and has repeatedly demanded the United States extradite Mr. Gulen, who fled Turkey 1999. On Election Day in 2016, Mr. Flynn published an op-ed article in The Hill, a newspaper serving Congress, calling Mr. Gulen ""a shady Islamic mullah"" and a ""radical Islamist."" Prosecutors did not charge Mr. Flynn with crimes related to his work on behalf of the Turkish government. But in documents, they have made clear that they have evidence that Mr. Flynn ""made materially false statements and omissions"" in his federal filings about that lobbying work. They admonished Mr. Flynn in Tuesday's memo for concealing his work for Turkey, saying it kept the public in the dark about the extent of its efforts to influence public opinion about the failed coup."

The drops in Asia and Europe came after stocks on Wall Street fell more than 3 percent on Tuesday. But global investors appeared to be calmer than their counterparts in the United States, after official comments by the Chinese government that were vague but nevertheless expressed confidence that talks between the two countries would yield a positive outcome. In Britain, France and Germany, stocks fell 0.6 percent, 1.4 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. In Hong Kong and in Taipei, Taiwan, investors sent the market down roughly 1.6 percent. Markets in Seoul, South Korea, and Tokyo finished slightly more than half a percent lower. China's currency, the renminbi, weakened slightly, by 0.3 percent, against the United States dollar on Wednesday. It trades within a band set by the People's Bank of China. It had reached a two-month peak earlier this week. Futures contracts that predict the performance of stocks in the United States indicated that shares there would rise when markets reopen on Thursday. They were to be closed on Wednesday in observance of the death of former President George Bush. Conflicting signals on the trade front have sent investors on a wild ride this week. Just two days ago  stocks rode a wave of optimism up after Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China agreed a truce over dinner in Buenos Aires on the sidelines of the G20 meeting. Since then, the White House has offered a mixed message about what, exactly, the two sides have agreed to. Mr. Trump has also chosen a trade hard-liner to lead the next round of talks. China's Ministry of Commerce has said negotiations would follow a timeline. The two sides have 90 days to work out a resolution. The biggest concern plaguing investors is that an extended trade war could erode global growth just as the world's biggest economies are already starting to cool. In China, there are increasing worries that the dispute will weigh on an economy that is under stress from a plunging stock market, a weakening currency and dampened consumer appetite. ""While investing we try to avoid the noise, but these trade war issues in China and Japan have the potential of such large impact on certain industries it's increasingly difficult to ignore,"" said Seth Fischer, the chief investment officer at Oasis Management, a hedge fund based in Hong Kong. Mr. Fischer was referring to potential tariffs on the automobile industry that could affect the entire supply chain across Asia. Mr. Trump referred to himself in one tweet on Tuesday as ""a Tariff Man"" In another, he wrote, ""We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China, or no deal at all — at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States."" Investors in the United States sent Treasury yields sharply down on Tuesday, a sign of broader concerns about growth. The difference between short- and long-term interest rates reached its lowest point since before the financial crisis. Some expect that long-term interest rates could soon fall below those short-term rates, a phenomenon known as an inversion of the yield curve. Inversions are closely watched by investors, as they have a good track record of correctly predicting recessions."

Brussels — supported by the rest of the governments of Europe — seems to believe that Rome will soon back down, delivering another victory for European Union discipline. But that's far from certain. Moreover, even if the Italian government does fall into line, the political consequences may prove disastrous for Europe. However the drama ends, Europe is playing a dangerous game. The confrontation began in October, when the government in Rome put forward a draft of its budget for 2019, which proposed an increase to Italy's deficit. On Oct. 23, the European Commission rejected the budget — an unprecedented move. Since then, Brussels has initiated steps to penalize Italy under the European Union's strict excess-deficit rules. Italy's real financial problem, however, is not the annual budget shortfall but the country's mountain of outstanding debt, running to a total of 2.6 trillion euros, most of which was piled up decades ago by political parties that no longer exist. Today the debt burden hovers around 133 percent of gross domestic product. Debts at this level can easily become unsustainable, growing faster than the income necessary to repay them. The debt is widely held by banks inside and outside Italy. A scenario in which Italy had difficulty meeting its financing needs would deal a shattering blow to Europe's fragile financial system. Given this delicate balance, there is little room for error. Every opportunity must be taken to lower the ratio of debt to G.D.P. With the eurozone's having experienced a modest recovery since 2013, and even Italy's economy growing again, the European Commission argues that Italy should tighten its belt. Rome demurs. Of course, no government wants to embrace cuts. But there is a more basic point here: For the commission to declare Italy fit to make budget cuts just because the country has seen some growth is in glaring contradiction to actual economic and political conditions. Over the past 10 years, Italy's gross domestic product per capita has fallen. This decline is unique among large advanced economies. (It is even worse than Japan's infamous lost decades.) And the suffering is extremely unevenly distributed: More than 32 percent of Italy's young people are unemployed. The gloom, disappointment and frustration are undeniable. For the commission to declare that this is a time for austerity flies in the face of a reality that for many Italians is closer to a personal and national emergency. The two parties that make up the current Italian government, the League and the Five Star Movement, were elected in March to address this crisis. The League is xenophobic; Five Star is erratic and zany. But the economic programs on which they campaigned are hardly outlandish. The League wants tax cuts for its core constituency of small businesses. Five Star wants a minimum income guarantee for its voters in Italy's poorer southern regions. Both want to coddle Italy's pensioners. These proposals will increase the deficit. But at the same time, Rome argues, they will deliver a much-needed stimulus. How much stimulus is the key question. The Italian government's budget forecasts are optimistic. But others, including the Bank of Italy and the Peterson Institute of International Economics, warn that Italy is caught in a trap: Anxieties about debt sustainability mean that any stimulus has the perverse effect of driving up interest rates, squeezing bank lending and reducing growth. During the eurozone crisis, economists at Bocconi University in Milan popularized the idea of ""expansionary austerity:"" government spending cuts stimulating confidence and growth. The years after the financial crisis showed how wrong that was. Now economists seem to have a new meme: contractionary fiscal expansion, stimulus that negates itself by undermining confidence and pushing up interest rates. Either way, these arguments are not decisive. Even on the European Commission's pessimistic assumptions, the deficits proposed by Rome wouldn't send the debt burden out of control. What would tip Italy into real crisis would be a sudden upward adjustment in yields not to 3 percent but to 5 percent or more. If that were to happen, caused by a shock to the market's confidence in Italy, there would be an explosive surge in debt service costs. The government could find itself shut out of funding markets. Italy's banks would require support from the European Union. Help would be forthcoming only after agreement on a deficit-cutting package. Barring that, Italy could find itself on the way out of the eurozone. This risk is what makes the confrontation between Rome and the commission so worrying. The game of chicken could easily spook the markets. Currently, market confidence is still supported by European Central Bank bond purchases. In 2019 the E.C.B.'s outgoing president, Mario Draghi, a longtime advocate of Italian discipline, is stopping the bank's bond buying. Tension is set to rise. The European Commission is, of course, bound to defend its rules. But how does the European Union expect the confrontation to play out? Brussels has a limited range of sanctions at its disposal. Unlike Greece, which was a net recipient of European Union largess, Italy is a net contributor to the European Union's budget. It won't be easy to make penalties and fines stick. It will therefore have to be the markets that deliver the discipline. But that is a terrifying prospect: Not only is Italy's debt huge, but Italy's banks are not minnows, either. Italy is both too big to fail and too big to bail. So what is the game plan? If the commission is gambling that the budget crisis will force Italy's government to fold, what direction does it imagine the government folding in? The last time Italy's public debt was in the eurozone's spotlight was in the fall of 2011. Then, the resolution was political: Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was toppled in favor of the unelected technocrat Mario Monti. Mr. Monti was the darling of the markets. But back home, public outrage against the suspension of normal democratic procedures helped to trigger the upsurge of the Five Star Movement, which culminated with its taking 32 percent of the vote in March. The European Commission can hardly wish to repeat that cycle. On the back of its election victory, Five Star was the senior partner in the coalition formed in May. But the balance of power has shifted. While Five Star's popularity has slid, support for the League has doubled to 34 percent. The League is a party of northern Italian small business. It is far from keen on Five Star's plans to increase welfare for the south. A League-dominated reshuffle that dropped Five Star's expensive minimum-income guarantee would go a long way to meeting the financial demands of the European Commission. The new government might even find common ground with Brussels on issues of ""supply-side reform."" That would no doubt reassure investors, but it would be a disastrous outcome for the European Union, handing a political victory to Matteo Salvini, Italy's deputy prime minister, who makes no secret of his desire to remake Europe as an arena of neo-nationalist, nativist politics. If strengthening the League is not the commission's intention, perhaps Brussels is hoping for a tactical withdrawal by Rome. A face-saving compromise may yet be arranged over the expensive pension proposals. If the government crumbles, perhaps a new election might yield a more compliant majority. But this is, to say the least, a high-risk and negative strategy. Above all it fails to address the deep sense of crisis in Italy. If the European Union is determined to hold the line on debt and deficits, it should offer something positive in exchange, such as a common European investment and growth strategy or a more cooperative approach to the refugee question, which has driven the upsurge in the League. If all Brussels has to offer is discipline, it is inviting the remaking of Italian politics along lines that are more nationalist and more hostile to Europe.

News,2018-12-05,Good Wednesday. Want this by email? Sign up here.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/business/dealbook/trump-trade-china.html,1927," Good Wednesday. Want this by email? Sign up here. It's a bird … It's a plane … It's ""Tariff Man,"" as President Trump dubbed himself in one of several provocative tweets he posted on Tuesday. And it seems that this superhero's special power may be an uncanny ability to get in his own way. Uncertainty hangs over the U.S.-China trade deal. Other than the 90-day postponement of further tariffs, it's unclear what was agreed to by Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires on Saturday. Bloomberg compared the diverging claims from Beijing and Washington, and it seems there's little agreement between the two sides. Mr. Trump may have overstated China's concessions. Michael Pillsbury, the former Pentagon official Mr. Trump has called ""probably the leading authority on China,"" told Axios that there was concern in China about American reports of concessions that Beijing never agreed to. They include the Chinese ""immediately"" addressing intellectual property theft, resuming purchases of American agricultural products and cutting car tariffs. And he continues to be bullish on the prospects for a pact. ""The negotiations with China have already started,"" Mr. Trump said on Twitter, and those leading the talks will see ""whether or not a REAL deal with China is actually possible."" His conclusion: ""If it is, we will get it done,"" he added. ""But if not remember, I am a Tariff Man."" But China may be starting to make moves. Beijing offered its first acknowledgment of the 90-day deadline, saying it was ""confident in implementing"" trade commitments to the U.S. ""as soon as possible."" Bloomberg notes that China is preparing to import U.S. soybeans and liquefied natural gas. Reuters reports that the Chinese oil trader Unipec plans to resume U.S. crude shipments to China in March. And China announced new punishments for intellectual property theft. That was fast. A day after stocks rallied after the announcement of a truce in the U.S.-China trade war, they bombed again: The S&P 500 lost more than 3 percent on Tuesday. But don't believe anyone who points to a single reason for the rout. Trade issues have a lot to do with it. Investors worry that the trade war is far from over, and that an extended dispute would undermine global growth and hurt American companies. As Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said yesterday, the markets are in a ""wait and see"" period while investors try to determine whether an actual trade deal can be struck. You can also blame the inverting yield curve. Part of the curve, which shows the difference between interest rates on short- and long-term government bonds, went negative on Monday, which is often considered a sign of a looming recession. That helped drive S&P 500 bank shares down 4.4 percent, making Tuesday their worst day since February. And there's more. Bloomberg points out that worries about the housing market, continuing volatility in the tech sector, the uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union and numerous other issues also weighed on the markets yesterday. But things might brighten. While global markets followed the U.S. sell-off overnight, futures tracking U.S. stocks are all ticking up this morning, most likely because of positive comments on trade by the Chinese government. (The U.S. markets are closed today in honor of former President George Bush, whose funeral will be held at Washington National Cathedral at 11 a.m. Eastern; they reopen on Thursday.) The draft of a report prepared for the board of CBS by lawyers for the company, and seen by the NYT, contains a series of new allegations against Mr. Moonves, CBS's former chief executive. The report says the company has justification to deny him $120 million in severance. Among the revelations in the document: • Mr. Moonves ""engaged in multiple acts of serious nonconsensual sexual misconduct in and outside of the workplace, both before and after he came to CBS in 1995."" Some of those allegations had not been previously disclosed. • Lawyers involved in the inquiry spoke with Mr. Moonves four times and found him to be ""evasive and untruthful at times, and to have deliberately lied about and minimized the extent of his sexual misconduct."" • Investigators determined that Mr. Moonves had ""received oral sex from at least 4 CBS employees under circumstances that sound transactional and improper to the extent that there was no hint of any relationship, romance or reciprocity."" The report also explains what the CBS board and management knew about Mr. Moonves's conduct. More on what that means from the NYT columnist James B. Stewart: Many of the company's employees, including high-ranking executives and even members of its board, were aware of the former chief executive Leslie Moonves's alleged sexual misconduct and subsequent efforts to conceal it. Yet no one acted to stop him — and the repercussions for that failure are likely to reverberate at CBS for years. President Trump repeatedly accused Amazon in the spring of engaging in a ""scam"" against the United States Postal Service. On Tuesday, his administration delivered its verdict: not really. More on that from Jim Tankersley of the NYT: The task force created by Mr. Trump to investigate the Postal Service's finances did conclude that the mail system is losing money. But a report issued on Tuesday said that commercial package delivery for Amazon and other e-commerce retailers was actually profitable for the Postal Service and was not costing the United States ""massive amounts of money,"" as Mr. Trump has suggested in his tweets. Commercial package delivery is not profitable enough to offset the revenue losses the Postal Service is suffering, however, as Americans mail fewer and fewer first-class letters. The report did recommend some changes: that the Postal Service change the price of package delivery to maximize profit instead of maximizing delivery volume, and that it create separate accounting books for letters and for packages, among other things. Such changes could increase delivery prices, making online retailers nervous. It's been two weeks since Mr. Ghosn, who led an alliance comprising Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, was arrested in Japan, and there hasn't been much clarity on how he might have sneaked $70 million of salary and benefits past the company that pays him, as he is suspected of doing. Now Jason Clenfield and Yuki Hagiwara of Bloomberg explain how he might have done that: What is certain is that Nissan Motor Co.'s own corporate governance rules gave unusual powers to its former chairman, a business celebrity who was given extraordinary deference for having once rescued the automaker from financial ruin. Those powers included near-total say over how much — and how — he was paid, according to Nissan's own internal rules. Several people familiar with the prosecutors' investigation now say the probe appears to hinge on a relatively arcane point of accounting — whether retirement payments were properly booked. The Bloomberg report also points to questionable governance at Nissan, with a concentration of power at the top and independent board members, including an ""ex-race-car driver and former model,"" who may not have been qualified to ask searching questions of the leadership team. The golden years of leisure after decades of toil are beginning to look very different, depending on where in the world you live and, increasingly, which generation you belong to. That's according to Katie Robertson of the NYT, writing in a special section of the newspaper about the future of retirement. Things look bleak. ""Nearly half of those surveyed in a recent report by the Aegon Center for Longevity and Retirement say future generations would be worse off than those now in retirement, partly because people are living longer. According to the United Nations, the number of those over 60 worldwide is expected to double by 2050 to 2.1 billion."" What needs to change? ""A new global retirement model would need to include universal access to a retirement savings system for workers, greater financial literacy and affordable health care, among other solutions.""

The Yellow Vests, who have thrown France into turmoil with violent protests in recent weeks, say they want more, and they want it sooner rather than later — lower taxes, higher salaries, freedom from gnawing financial fear, and a better life. Those deeper demands, the government's inability to keep up, and fierce resentment of prosperous and successful cities run like an electrified wire connecting populist uprisings in the West, including in Britain, Italy, the United States and, to a lesser extent, Central Europe. What ties these uprisings together, beyond the demands, is a rejection of existing parties, unions and government institutions that are seen as incapable of channeling the depth of their grievances or of offering a bulwark against economic insecurity. But what makes France's revolt different is that it has not followed the usual populist playbook. It is not tethered to a political party, let alone to a right-wing one. It is not focusing on race or migration, and those issues do not appear on the Yellow Vests' list of complaints. It is not led by a single fire-breathing leader. Nationalism is not on the agenda. The uprising is instead mostly organic, spontaneous and self-determined. It is mostly about economic class. It is about the inability to pay the bills. In that regard, it is more Occupy than Orban — more akin to the protests against Wall Street driven by the working poor in the United States than the race-based, flag-waving of Hungary's increasingly authoritarian leader, Viktor Orban. In Paris, it was the luxury shopping streets, the Avenue Kleber and the Rue de Rivoli — insolent symbols of urban privilege compared with the drab provinces from which the Yellow Vests emerged — where windows were smashed on Saturday. But it is also about a deep distrust of societal institutions that are perceived as working against the interests of the citizens, and that will make this crisis particularly hard for the government to resolve. The Yellow Vests push politicians away and reject Socialists, the far right, President Emmanuel Macron's political movement, and everybody else in between. The movement was ""totally unanticipated by the parties,'' said the political scientist Dominique Reynié. ''The system is in crisis."" In fact, so far at least, France's movement remains relatively unstructured. It has yet to be hijacked by either the far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen, or the far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, try as they might to claim ownership. And that is what makes France's movement unique, compared with, say, the Five Star Movement in Italy, which grew up out of a similar disgust with political parties and a distrust of elites, and which has held itself out as the authentic expression of the popular will. But Five Star was always less movement than new-age political party. While organized over the internet, it was led by prominent figures (Beppe Grillo, for one) as well as more obscure ones (the Casaleggios) who stoked, channeled and harnessed the popular discontent from the start. Much the same can be said of the now-floundering U.K. Independence Party in Britain, which gave voice to Brexit and the public's rejection of European Union structures, as well as its class divides with London. Or for that matter, of President Trump, who demonstrates contempt for institutions. His rural and exurban supporters agree with him. ""It is the same fear, anger and anxiety in France, Italy and the United Kingdom,"" said Enrico Letta, a former prime minister of Italy who now teaches at Sciences Po university in Paris. ""These three countries have the highest level of class slippage,"" he said. For the 30 years after World War II, ""they were at the top of the world,"" Mr. Letta said, ""at the very center."" These countries ""used to live with a very high level of average well-being,"" he said. ""Now, there is a great fear of seeing it all slip away."" That fear transcends all others. Thus, in Italy, Five-Star's proposal for a ""citizens' income,"" or guaranteed income like an unemployment benefit, helped the movement conquer the impoverished south. In Britain, Brexit was sold partly as an escape from the perceived crippling of financial constraints from the European Union. ""There's this social distress that exists more or less everywhere,"" said Marc Lazar, a specialist in Italian history at Sciences Po. ""Of people who are very worried about the future, not only are they suffering, but they have profound distrust of institutions and political parties. This is what we are seeing everywhere in Europe."" Comparing the four countries — Britain, France, Italy and the United States — Christophe Guilluy, a French geographer who has studied the demographics of the ""left-behinds,"" said ""the sociology of the people in revolt is the same."" ""These are the people who feel endangered by the current economic model,"" which doesn't ""integrate the greatest number,"" he said. In France, fury at the perceived distance of the executive has not helped the government. ""The president has not once spoken to the French,"" the Yellow Vest spokesman Éric Drouet said on French TV on Tuesday, referring to Mr. Macron's relative silence over the last week. ""There's a total denial by our president."" There is a paradox in the current French standoff, as Mr. Macron's rise was itself predicated on sweeping away existing political parties, and on a rejection of traditional intermediaries like labor unions. His campaign book was called Revolution, and it expressed a kind of contempt for the parties that had handed off power to each other for 50 years. Mr. Macron, by personalizing power and rejecting what had come before, helped create the world of institutional weakness in which the Yellow Vests are now flourishing. But his base, then and now, was exceedingly small, presaging his current wide rejection by the French, not just by the Yellow Vests. He won only 24 percent of the vote in the first round of voting last year — while his opponents on the far right and far left together won over 40 percent of the vote. Those numbers have now come home to haunt Mr. Macron in a political landscape where nearly eight out of 10 French citizens no longer support him, according to a recent poll. Mr. Macron, it turns out, is also a change agent out of step with the times, just as France's long delay in biting off structural economic overhauls has left it out of sync with its Western cohort. He is now trying to push through reforms to make France more business-friendly and competitive, as Britain did in the 1980s and Germany in the 1990s. Meanwhile, the global backlash is already cresting, fueled by the income disparities those changes ushered in. The partial sacking of Paris's rich, tourism-dominated districts last weekend was merely the physical expression of what all these movements feel deeply, in the view of analysts: hatred of the ""winners"" in the global system, symbolized by urban elites. ""It's the provinces against Paris, the proud and contemptuous capital,"" Mr. Reynié said. ""And Paris has never been so dissimilar to the rest of France. The fracture is very, very sharp."" The combination of discontent and distrust has made the Yellow Vests an expanding force that almost certainly has yet to reach its limits. The protest has already changed from a revolt over a small gas tax increase to demands for higher salaries, and more. ""Right now, give us more purchasing power,"" Jean-François Barnaba, a Yellow Vest spokesman in the Indre administrative department, told BFM TV on Tuesday. ""The gas tax was only the beginning,"" said Tony Roussel, a spokesman for the movement in Marseille. ""Now there are all the other taxes. There are salaries. There is the minimum wage."" The government's response is especially fraught. On the one hand, top officials express sympathy, not daring otherwise as polls show wide support for the movement; on the other, the same officials are angry and exasperated over the violent challenge to France's institutional structure. The result is a kind of paralysis, halting adjustments that are only likely to invite more challenges. ""They still haven't understood our demands,"" Mr. Roussel said by telephone this week. ""This was like a firecracker in the water,"" he said of the government's decision to suspend a planned gas tax for at least six months. The protests will go on, he vowed — until deeper concessions are made."
News,2018-12-05,Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/business/dealbook/china-venture-capital.html,370," Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ China's venture capital party may be about to get quieter. This year, for the first time, Chinese start-ups raised more cash than their Silicon Valley counterparts, notching up $56 billion in six months. But the excitement may be cooling as the year ends, thanks to tougher regulation and a slowing economy. A shakeout could easily follow. It has been a blowout 2018. For the first half of the year, a study released this week by the data provider Preqin and Insead business school suggests that China beat the $42 billion raised in the United States by some way. That's largely thanks to a huge funding round for Alibaba's financial affiliate, Ant Financial, as well as some other chunky efforts. But it's a high-water mark regardless. As is, perhaps, SoftBank's mooted move to place a team in China to help spend its giant Vision Fund, after years of investing remotely. The coming months look less exuberant. The likes of SoftBank and Singapore's Temasek still have plenty of money to plow into splashy names like the news and video-sharing app ByteDance. Others are less enthusiastic, if figures for China-focused venture funds are anything to go by. In the 11 months to mid-November, around 70 such funds raised just over $15 billion, Preqin estimates; that compares to $40 billion or so raised by 330 funds in all of 2016. All of this suggests increased nerves. The vast majority of Chinese unicorns that listed this year, including the takeaways-to-taxis app Meituan Dianping and the smartphone-maker Xiaomi, are now underwater. Just a small fraction of those $1 billion-plus companies, including video-streaming companies Huya, Bilibili and iQiyi, have risen above their initial public offering prices. Rocky starts like that of the Alibaba-backed parenting site Babytree, which debuted last month at a valuation below its last funding round, won't help. What most of this year's debutantes have in common is that they bet on local consumers, one way or another. But those shoppers look more fretful. Changes to rules on education, fintech and gaming have only added to the strain. Weaker companies may fall by the wayside."
News,2018-12-06,"In a move meant to stabilize an organization still reeling, and barely standing, in the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, U.S.A. Gymnastics filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday in Indianapolis.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/sports/usa-gymnastics-bankruptcy.html,665," In a move meant to stabilize an organization still reeling, and barely standing, in the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, U.S.A. Gymnastics filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday in Indianapolis. Kathryn Carson, the federation's newly elected chairwoman, characterized the bankruptcy filing as a reorganization, ""not a liquidation,"" of the federation, which oversees the sport of gymnastics in the United States. More than 300 plaintiffs, including Olympic gymnasts, have sued U.S.A. Gymnastics for failing to protect them from Nassar, the former national team doctor, and the mediation process with some of Nassar's victims was ""not moving at any pace,"" Carson said. She said she believed the bankruptcy, which was filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the southern district of Indiana, will hasten claim payments to all the plaintiffs. ""We owe it to the survivors to resolve, fully and finally, claims based on the horrific acts of the past and, through this process, seek to expedite resolution and help them move forward,"" she said in a statement. In a financial report earlier this year, auditors for U.S.A. Gymnastics estimated the potential cost of the federation's litigation to be between $75 million and $150 million, though lawyers involved in the lawsuits say those numbers are laughably low. Carson said payouts to victims would be covered by insurance, and those payouts won't be affected by the bankruptcy filing. Besides the insurance money, she said the federation has ""no other significant assets"" to pay the victims. In Wednesday's bankruptcy filing, the organization listed its liabilities and its assets each at between $50 million and $100 million. The filing on Wednesday also might stop the United States Olympic Committee from decertifying U.S.A. Gymnastics, a process it began last month in order to strip the organization of its power as a governing body. The U.S.O.C. began the decertification process because it believed the federation had made too many missteps — including in its widely criticized choices for the chief executive position in the post-Nassar era — and had proven incapable of running itself properly. A U.S.O.C. spokesman, Patrick Sandusky, said his organization was reviewing the bankruptcy filing to see how it would affect the decertification process. He said it's the U.S.O.C.'s job to ensure that each sports federation ""has the capacity and capability to prove the support, protection and services that we expect for all Olympic athletes in the United States."" However the bankruptcy filing affects the organization, its lawsuits and its ability to remain in charge of gymnastics in the United States, there is a deadline for U.S.A. Gymnastics to stabilize itself: The Tokyo 2020 Summer Games are less than two years away, and gymnastics is one of the United States' marquee sports. It also features one of the United States' biggest Olympic stars, Simone Biles, who is slated to lead the Americans as they look to win their third straight Olympic gold medal in the team event. By then, U.S.A. Gymnastics will need major sponsors. Its main supporters fled the organization after the Nassar scandal broke in 2016. Carson said the bankruptcy filing and subsequent resolution of the claims against the federation ""are the first critical steps in rebuilding the community's trust."" That trust needs to be rebuilt with potential sponsors, too. John Manly, the lawyer for many of Nassar's victims, was upset that the bankruptcy filing would end all discovery and depositions in the lawsuits against U.S.A. Gymnastics. He believes that would be a devastating development in the pursuit of who knew what and when in the abuse case. According to Manly, it's now up to Congress and law enforcement to pursue the matter, so Nassar's enablers could eventually face punishment. ""The leadership of U.S.A. Gymnastics has proved itself to be morally and financially bankrupt,"" he said, adding that the federation is ""incapable of meeting their obligations as an Olympic governing body."" But the federation's immediate fate, and the fate of the investigative phase of the lawsuits, is now in the hands of a judge."
News,2018-12-06,"CHEMNITZ, Germany — Two weeks after announcing that she would not seek another term, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was standing in an old locomotive factory in the eastern city of Chemnitz, the scene of far-right protests this year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/world/europe/merkel-legacy-germany.html,2456," CHEMNITZ, Germany — Two weeks after announcing that she would not seek another term, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was standing in an old locomotive factory in the eastern city of Chemnitz, the scene of far-right protests this year. Outside, 2,500 protesters shouted: ""Merkel must go!"" Inside, 120 people — more polite but scarcely less hostile — had come to challenge the chancellor on her legacy, which on this November afternoon was mostly reduced to one thing: her 2015 decision to welcome more than a million migrants into Germany. ""You said we would manage,"" one man said, quoting Ms. Merkel's now famous mantra back at her. ""But we're not managing."" As Ms. Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Party gathers this week to choose her successor as party leader — and the likely future chancellor of Germany — the values she embodied through 13 years in power are in danger. Some now ask whether her leadership, in particular on migration and economic austerity, helped plant the seeds of the forces now tearing Europe apart. Ms. Merkel has pledged to finish out her term, which ends in 2021. But even if she defies the political obituary writers, the time in between is likely to be less than a victory lap for a chancellor who has been the face of stability in Germany and Europe, for better or worse. ""I know my face is polarizing,"" Ms. Merkel conceded in Chemnitz. That is true in Athens, Budapest and Rome as well. Ms. Merkel has been both chancellor of Germany and the leader of Europe. She steered her country and the continent through successive crises as she helped Germany become Europe's leading power for the first time since two world wars. No one has shaped the Europe of today more than this vicar's daughter from the former Communist East who was celebrated as the guardian of the liberal Western order. Ms. Merkel allowed Germans to be proud again, but on her watch the old demons of nationalism stirred back to life, too. The European Union she fought so hard to preserve is assailed by populist leaders. Those contradictions rest at the core of the Merkel legacy. As German chancellor, Ms. Merkel oversaw a golden decade for Europe's largest economy, which expanded by more than a fifth, pushing unemployment to the lowest levels since the early 1980s. As the United States was distracted by multiple wars, Britain gambled its future on a referendum to leave the European Union and France failed to reform itself, Ms. Merkel's Germany was mostly a haven of stability. But her decision to embrace more than a million asylum seekers unsettled that cozy status quo. Outside Germany, the austerity she and her longtime finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble imposed on debtor countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal and, especially, Greece sowed misery and resentment that fester to this day. Some, like the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, compare Ms. Merkel's austerity politics to the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed punitive economic measures on Germany after World War I, humiliated the country and fanned the flames of populism. ""This is now what is feeding the political beasts,"" Mr. Varoufakis said. Many of her postwar predecessors had strongly defined legacies. Konrad Adenauer anchored Germany in the West. Willy Brandt reached across the Iron Curtain. Helmut Kohl, her onetime mentor, became synonymous with German unity. Gerhard Schröder paved the way for Germany's economic success. Ms. Merkel's legacy is more fragile. She gave power a female face, and some say she softened politics and made it easier for her country to resume its historic dominance in Europe. She was careful never to boast about what had been regained. But she also failed to instill in her people a sense of responsibility and solidarity for fellow Europeans. Her modest and moderate governance style, absent ideology and vanity, is the polar opposite of that of the strongmen now strutting the world stage. Her Germany — that ""vulnerable hegemon,"" as the intellectual Herfried Münkler calls it — became a beacon of liberalism. But like her friend and ally President Barack Obama — America's first black president, who was succeeded by President Trump — Ms. Merkel will be judged by what comes next. ""Angela Merkel personifies the best Germany we've ever known,"" said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European Studies at Oxford University. ""She managed Germany's rise to once again become Europe's leading power. But she failed to prepare Germans sufficiently for what that means."" On a sunny afternoon in June 2006, Ms. Merkel was standing at the window of the chancellery in Berlin, waving to the crowd of soccer fans below who were making their way to a gigantic outdoor screen. An avid soccer fan herself, she had been chancellor for only seven months when Germany hosted the men's soccer World Cup — and when, across the country, German flags began fluttering proudly from car mirrors and apartment windows. The German team came third that year. But the tournament soon entered folk memory as ""the summer fairy tale"" — the rebirth of a liberal German patriotism in a country where national pride had long been taboo. ""That fledgling national pride that had been kept down for so long was allowed to come out, because at the very top was someone who was incredibly sensitive,"" said Evelyn Roll, one of Ms. Merkel's biographers. Or as Ines Pohl, the editor in chief of the public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, put it: ""Angela Merkel allowed Germans to be proud again."" Ms. Merkel has never been one for rousing speeches. (""We had those kinds of speeches 70 years ago,"" Ms. Roll said. ""Her lack of talent and interest in this department was a good thing."") She never boasted that Germany got what it wanted after summit meetings (though it mostly did). But as exports and domestic demand boomed, Germany prospered and so did Ms. Merkel's popularity ratings. Some say her status as a double outsider — a woman who had grown up in the East succeeding in a world of Western, mostly male politicians — ultimately changed Germany. Gregor Gysi, a fellow Easterner and political opponent from the Left party, said that spending half her life under Communism gave her a visceral thirst for freedom — but also made her more socially conscious than other Western conservatives. Over the decade that followed, she nudged her country and her conservative party to the left: New parents obtained generous new benefits, nuclear power was abandoned and same-sex marriage became legal. ""Merkel knows a different form of social and societal equality,"" Mr. Gysi said, adding of her former center-left rivals: ""That made her so much more open to adopting ideas from the Social Democrats."" It helped that she could be an incredibly skilled, even ruthless, tactician. ""I know something about coalition politics,"" an aide to David Cameron recalled her telling Britain's then prime minister in 2010, when he entered a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. ""You'll be fine, but your junior partner will be destroyed."" Indeed, now in the third so-called grand coalition with the Social Democrats, Ms. Merkel's habit of taking inspiration from (and credit for) their ideas has left the party a shadow of itself. It has also opened her own party to challenges on its right flank, leaving room for the emergence of the nationalist Alternative for Germany, which capitalized on her decision on asylum seekers. Nine years after the 2006 World Cup, Germany's summer fairy tale had a short-lived sequel. In the summer of 2015, as hundreds of thousands of migrants were pushing into Europe, and Hungarian and Austrian officials asked for her help, Ms. Merkel obliged. Germans lined the platforms, clapping as the migrant trains rolled in. Ms. Merkel's own image as the austerity chancellor had troubled her, she told her biographer Stefan Kornelius. In the throes of the migrant crisis, she showed neighboring countries a more generous Germany. It was a moment of redemption for her nation. The French president François Mitterrand and his British counterpart Margaret Thatcher had both worried about a resurgence of ""bad Germans."" Ms. Merkel's greatest achievement, Ms. Roll said, was that ""she came to represent the good Germans."" Her 2015 decision won her admiration from far beyond her own political camp. ""In this world where more and more walls are being built, literally, she did the right thing,"" said Claudia Roth, vice president of the German parliament and a member of the Greens. ''She had principles."" ""It won Germany incredible respect — this image of a friendly humanitarian Germany, a Germany that protects,"" Ms. Roth said. ""She marked that image."" But it was not long before cracks started appearing at home. Alternative for Germany, founded in 2013 as a euroskeptic party at the height of the euro crisis, got its second wind in 2015 with the arrival of the migrants. Three years later, the party is the third largest in the federal parliament and sits in all regional parliaments, too. ""German populism is perhaps not her child,"" said Henrik Enderlein, the dean of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. ""But it is a child of the Merkel era."" Ms. Merkel's decision on migration was the most defining moment of her chancellorship. It softened her image. But in her immediate neighborhood, coming deep in a lost economic decade, it did not quite have the healing effect she intended. To some, it cemented her reputation as dictating terms to the rest of a reluctant Europe, particularly in a south that had borne the brunt of the continent's dual economic and migration crises. In 2012, the first time it appeared that Greece might have to leave the currency union, caricatures of Ms. Merkel began circulating in the country: Ms. Merkel with a Hitler mustache. Ms. Merkel as a domina, her leather boot on southern Europe. Ms. Merkel as a puppet of Mr. Schäuble, the mastermind of the austerity doctrine. Even before the migration crisis arrived, the debt crisis provided a pivotal test for a chancellor at the helm of a newly dominant Germany. And it led to criticism that Ms. Merkel, while leading humbly, was no less the hegemon — prioritizing German interests; manipulating European Union institutions to Germany's abiding benefit; turning southern countries into captive export markets; tightening the hold of German banks. Was hers a European Germany, one that saw Europe's interests as its own? Or a Germany that ultimately wanted a German Europe? Many economists, and even Mr. Obama, called for looser policies, but Ms. Merkel held firm. The debate still rages over whether greater flexibility would have restored growth faster, as her critics contend, or whether fiscal restraint was needed to safeguard the euro currency, as Ms. Merkel and her supporters argued. The real missed opportunity, observers say, was to use the crisis to propel a more far-reaching build-out of European Union institutions, which remain unprepared for the next financial meltdown. If there was ever a time to make a bold push to complete the institutions of the eurozone, this was it, said Joschka Fischer, a former German foreign minister. ""An Adenauer or a Kohl would have done it,"" Mr. Fischer said. But Merkel, who had grown up behind the Iron Curtain and without the Western pro-European mind-set, ""wasn't there yet,"" he said. ""Her European conscience was not fully formed yet."" The absence of vision at that time is ""the biggest minus on her record,"" said Mr. Garton Ash, of Oxford. But if Ms. Merkel's upbringing meant that her European consciousness took longer to form, it perhaps made her bolder in other areas, like standing up to Russia and Mr. Trump, as well as her decision not to close Germany's borders to migrants. ""Of course you can build walls,'' said Gerald Knaus, the founding chairman of the European Stability Initiative, who has advised Ms. Merkel on migration for over a decade. ""But she always made clear: 'I don't build deadly walls,' "" he recalled her saying. ""She grew up behind one."" One early verdict on Ms. Merkel's legacy will be pronounced on Friday, when delegates of her Christian Democrats gather at a party congress in Hamburg and vote for a new party leader. A vote for Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the party's general secretary, known as A.K.K., would be an endorsement of the chancellor's quietly centrist course. It would also be a strong signal for women at a time when strongmen politics are gaining momentum in Europe and beyond. ""If A.K.K. succeeds Merkel, it would be her masterpiece — another woman, confident, unpretentious, who continues her liberal course,"" Mr. Knaus said. A vote for Friedrich Merz, a former Merkel rival and millionaire with a visceral sense of self-confidence, would suggest that in Germany, too, the yearning for more charismatic — and male — leadership has won the day. Mr. Merz once voted against criminalizing rape in marriage. In Germany, too, politics has become noisier and nastier. Open sexism has entered the chamber with Alternative for Germany, said Ms. Roth, the vice president of the parliament. ""Merkel has been the target of countless attacks, gendered attacks, sexualized dirt,"" Ms. Roth said. ""She is the enemy, and the way she has been personally attacked as a woman is awful,"" she said. ""That would not happen to a white man. And still, she remains upright, chin raised, and keeps working."" Some have begun to referring to Merkelism, a modest but steadfast liberalism built on consensus rather than confrontation, as a recipe for democratic governance in the 21st century. Others fear that Merkelism will disappear with her. ""She is so unvain that she does not overly care about leaving behind a blueprint for the West 4.0,"" said Mr. Kornelius, her biographer. ""She primarily wants to preserve what she can."" She has prevented crises rather than carried out visions, Mr. Kornelius said, and has been reactive rather than proactive. ""But that is incredibly valuable at a time when we are dealing with questions of our liberal order in an unraveling world — and with leaders like Donald Trump."" To her fans she is a reminder of a time when liberal democracy was expanding across the world. Today, Ms. Merkel's Germany can feel like a liberal island in a growing sea of illiberal forces. She has not changed — the world around her has. ""She is already an exception today,"" Mr. Knaus said. ""I hope she is not a relic of an era that is coming to an end."" Even some of her fiercest enemies look with trepidation to a future without her. ""She was a catastrophe,"" said Mr. Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, ""and she will be missed, because who comes next will certainly be worse."""
News,2018-12-06,LOS ANGELES — The last year has been a roller coaster with 20 loops for MoviePass and its customers.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/business/media/moviepass-subscription-plan.html,952," LOS ANGELES — The last year has been a roller coaster with 20 loops for MoviePass and its customers. The fast-growing subscription service for movie tickets spent months insisting that it was not running out of money despite evidence to the contrary. That emergency loan to keep operating? All part of the plan. That auditor's report about escalating losses? Ignore it. Abrupt changes in service — some movies are restricted, now they're not — arrived without warning or explanation. Now, MoviePass is asking for forgiveness and hoping to move forward by unveiling a three-tiered pricing structure that takes effect on Jan. 1. As part of the course correction, Mitch Lowe, the company's chief executive, will turn over day-to-day operations of the company to Khalid Itum, an executive vice president at MoviePass. Mr. Lowe, a former Netflix and Redbox executive, will keep his title and instead focus on long-term strategy. ""I don't believe that today people trust the MoviePass brand,"" Mr. Itum said in an interview at a MoviePass office in West Hollywood. ""We have to earn back that trust. And we're going to earn it back not by spending on marketing but by fixing the product."" Mr. Itum, describing himself as a movie buff who recently went to see ""Boy Erased"" in a theater by himself, insisted that MoviePass had taken to heart ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" of the past year. ""We need to be empathetic and think about our members — what it's been like for them to be whiplashed and wake up one day and this is different and now this is different,"" he said. Mr. Lowe added: ""The way we have been going about this is not the right way. We listened. We reassessed."" MoviePass struck a nerve in August 2017 when it began offering an eye-popping deal. For $10 a month, members could see a movie a day in theaters, including new releases, 365 days a year. To a degree, the plan depended on traditional subscription economics: more people pay than actually go. Within months, three million people had signed up — far more than Mr. Lowe had anticipated — pushing MoviePass to the brink. In August, the company reduced the number of movies that subscribers could see to three a month and restricted the films to a rotating list. Starting in January, MoviePass will offer three plans. Each offers members three films a month, or up to 36 movies a year. The basic plan, Select, will cost $10 to $15 based on where in the country subscribers live. (Ticket prices are generally much cheaper in smaller cities than in big ones.) Members will not have access to 3-D screenings and the selection of films will be limited to certain titles on certain days. The next tier, All Access, will cost $15 to $20 and carry no restrictions on film selection beyond 3-D screenings. Red Carpet plans, costing $20 to $25, will include one Imax, 3-D or other large-format screening a month. To spur interest, MoviePass will begin selling All Access and Red Carpet packages on Thursday at a reduced ""holiday"" rate. Mr. Lowe and Mr. Itum said they hoped the new structure would reverse a decline in subscribers — MoviePass has acknowledged erosion but not to what degree — and allow the company to attract additional investors. In the meantime, money to operate in the long term remains an issue. Helios and Matheson Analytics, which owns MoviePass and trades on the Nasdaq exchange, said in a securities filing last month that it had only $6.2 million in cash on hand and about $23.3 million on deposit held by credit card processors. Helios and Matheson's stock price has been trading at such low levels — it closed at about  2 cents on Wednesday — that the company is danger of being delisted. It is also facing investor lawsuits and an investigation by the New York attorney general, Barbara Underwood, about whether it misrepresented its finances. ""We believe our public disclosures have been complete, timely and truthful,"" the company said in a statement. Founded in 2011, MoviePass trundled along for years without incident by charging $50 a month, later lowered to $35. Under its business model, theaters get paid full price for every admission. People who sign up receive a membership card that functions like a debit card. When members want to see a movie, they use a MoviePass smartphone app to check in at the theater. The app instantly transfers the price of a ticket to the membership card. Members in turn use the card to pay for entry. It all works independently of theaters, sometimes to their chagrin. In 2017, Mr. Lowe and Theodore Farnsworth, chief executive of Helios and Matheson, took over MoviePass and drastically cut subscription prices. More than one million people signed up in four months. Membership kept growing, passing the three million mark in June, and simple economics kicked in. MoviePass was shelling out more for tickets than it was taking in from subscriptions. MoviePass had hoped to make money by striking bulk ticket pricing partnerships with theaters, charging studios fees to promote new films to members and perhaps even getting theaters to share a slice of concession revenue. But the big theater chains and many studios recoiled. ""Unlimited movies in theaters for $9.95 was offensive to them because they thought it devalued their product,"" Mr. Itum said. Mr. Itum and Mr. Lowe said they expected studios and theater owners to be more amenable to the new plans. Part of their new strategy involves teaming with theater owners to help fill multiplexes during off-peak times. ""If there is anything we've learned,"" Mr. Lowe said, ""it's to be a good member of the ecosystem."""

Now, all around the globe, the walls are going up for Huawei. The United States, which for years has considered the Chinese telecommunications giant a security threat, aimed a straight shot at the company's leadership when it secured the arrest, in Canada, of Huawei's chief financial officer. But lately, Huawei's setbacks have come on multiple fronts, from New Zealand and Australia to Britain and Canada. China sees the company as a pivotal driver of its ambitions for global technological leadership. Increasingly, much of the rest of the world sees it as a potential conduit for espionage and sabotage. [Stock markets were shaken by the arrest, as investors feared the impact on U.S.-China trade relations.] Huawei said Thursday that it was not aware of any wrongdoing by its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is a daughter of the company's founder, and that it complied with the law wherever it operated. The company has long denied that it spies on behalf of Beijing. For many years, the fog of distrust surrounding Huawei was a problem largely confined to the United States. Large American mobile carriers such as AT&T have avoided using Huawei's equipment in their networks ever since a 2012 congressional report highlighted the security risks. In response, Huawei focused its business efforts elsewhere. Its success in wealthy places such as Europe has helped it become the planet's largest maker of telecommunications equipment, as well as its No. 2 smartphone brand. Of the more than $90 billion in revenue it earned last year, more than a quarter came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Now, a wider patch of the world appears to be siding with Washington against Chinese technology. A turn en masse against the company, led by governments in many of its most important markets, would have grave implications for its business. Australia barred Huawei this year from supplying technology for the country's fifth-generation, or 5G, mobile networks. New Zealand last week blocked one of its leading mobile carriers from buying Huawei's 5G gear. Britain's intelligence chief, in a rare public appearance this week, said that the country had a difficult decision to make on whether to allow Huawei to build its 5G infrastructure. And Canada's top spy echoed those concerns, without naming Huawei or China, in a speech on Tuesday. Huawei has tested 5G equipment with major mobile carriers in both Canada and Britain. Behind the tariff fight that has engulfed Washington and Beijing lies a deeper contest for leadership in future technologies such as supercomputing, artificial intelligence and 5G mobile internet. For many people in China, the contest feels not merely commercial, but civilizational. At stake is the country's ability to claim its rightful place as a superpower. ""The Chinese government and Chinese companies must face these new circumstances, take up new countermeasures and get through this stage of crisis,"" Fang Xingdong, the founder of ChinaLabs, a technology think tank in Beijing, said on Thursday. ""This is a necessary rite of passage for China's global technological rise."" Huawei has tried to avoid being pulled into this fight. In an internal memo from January that was reviewed by The New York Times, Ren Zhengfei, the company's founder, outlined a strategy for navigating these uncertain times. The key, he wrote: Keep adapting. But do so quietly. ""Sometimes, it's better to find a safe place and wait for stormy weather to pass,"" Mr. Ren wrote. Europe was one such place, Mr. Ren said. Huawei has cultivated political friendships and invested heavily in places like Britain. ""Eventually, through years of effort, our goal is for Europeans to perceive Huawei as a European company,"" Mr. Ren wrote. Canada seemed to be another safe harbor. ""The Canadian government is very sensible and open, giving us enormous confidence in our investments in this country,"" Mr. Ren wrote. This was all before Washington nearly put out of business Huawei's main Chinese rival, ZTE. In April, the Commerce Department barred ZTE from using components made in the United States after saying the company had failed to punish employees who violated American sanctions against Iran and North Korea. The move was effectively a death sentence because ZTE relied heavily on American microchips and other technology. In building its case against ZTE, the United States government began investigating Huawei as well. When the Commerce Department first announced its findings against ZTE in 2016, it released an internal ZTE document illustrating best practices for evading American sanctions. In describing the approach, the document cited a company it nicknamed F7 as a model for how to pull it off. The description of F7 in the document matched Huawei. A few months later, the Commerce Department subpoenaed Huawei and requested all information about its export or re-export of American technology to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, according to a copy of the subpoena seen by The Times. The inquiry widened this year when the Treasury and Commerce Departments asked the Justice Department to investigate Huawei for possible sanctions violations. Prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York took on the case. Eventually, the Trump administration decided to ease its punishment of ZTE, in an effort to cool tensions with China's leader, Xi Jinping, ahead of a historic North Korea meeting. But the power that Washington wielded over the fates of Chinese tech companies had been made very clear to people on both sides of the Pacific. In October, the Commerce Department imposed export controls on Fujian Jinhua, a state-backed semiconductor company that has been accused of stealing American chip designs. Should Huawei be subjected to a ban on using American technology, the consequences would be significant, though perhaps not as life-threatening as they were for ZTE. One crucial difference is that Huawei, unlike ZTE, does not depend extensively on outside vendors such as Qualcomm for the main chips in its smartphones. Around two-thirds of the handsets that Huawei sells contain chips made in-house, said Sean Kao, a hardware analyst at the research firm IDC. Still, American firms supply other kinds of chips in Huawei's gear as well as optical equipment for its fiber cable networks and other specialized parts. ""I don't know exactly how many suppliers are affected,"" said Stéphane Téral, senior research director at the data provider IHS Markit. But one thing is certain, he said: ""They won't be easily substitutable."""

We have long ago come to terms with the trade-off that to participate in social media, we must first give up our privacy. We sacrifice vital parts of our personal data so that we may amplify our voice, stroke our ego and connect with a virtual tribe. Turning Points asked the writer Maggie Shen King to explore a data-driven dystopia, and she responded with a piece of flash fiction. Sofie could not understand why the bidding stopped a week ago. Her database of 87 million Facebook records was the weapon of the century. Its cache of personal information made spear phishing child's play. A pre-emptive bid should have ended her auction before it even began. She checked her countdown clock — 5 minutes 39 seconds. Auctions were, of course, all about the last seconds. She hadn't a doubt she'd lured all the right players to her party, so why was the bid stuck at half of where it should be? Her stomach would not stop churning. She pinched her wrist and held her breath. These records were hers. She was the one smart enough to grab them before Cambridge Analytica blew up and kicked her to the curb. What she was doing was no different than what her employer had done to Facebook and what Facebook had done to their users. And had those users not valued the serendipitous reconnections with high school boyfriends, the ego strokes from bragging about their expensive vacations and their little child prodigies and a public forum in which to harangue their elected officials, they would not have put their private information out there. Facebook users understood that they had to give away a part of themselves for easy connections and the much-coveted limelight. Sofie tore off a hangnail with her teeth. She had become her father. She'd thumbed her nose at his poker dens and bookie operation, signed her name to a boatload of student loans and declared independence. But after Cambridge Analytica gave her the boot without so much as a kind word or her last paycheck, she finally understood that money bought self-respect. Without self-respect, she was nothing. She returned to her auction site on the dark web. Still no action. Her reserve price had surfaced the four whales. Would she be showing weakness or, worse, desperation sending them a reminder? No, she was in charge, and she would demonstrate that with a final prod, a do-it-or-lose-forever stick-in-the-eye. Above all else, her bidders could not abide losing. Nor could they afford to. She began with Saeed, her Iranian contact. Micro-targeted spear phishing would be much more potent than the SQL injection and DDoS attacks they had used to cripple American banking websites. Her database would provide a rash of entry points for their malware to take down Saudi oil fields. Salâam alaikum. Our auction ends in 4 minutes. Just between us, the Chinese are coming in with a billion at the close. I'd rather you win AND stick it to the American infidels by paying me with their hostage ransom money. Are you going to let their crippling sanctions and the Israeli destruction of your priceless centrifuges go unanswered? She waited for a reply, but heard just the drumming of her own heart. She moved on to Pak, her North Korean connection. Their Reconnaissance General Bureau was at least 5,000 hackers strong and adept at brute force cyberattacks. Their email hack of Sony Pictures for the lampooning of their supreme leader had devastated the company. With Sofie's database, they could take down more financial institutions and military agencies, keep themselves on the world stage and finance their feeble economy at the same time. 정식여보세요. Billion dollar bid just came in from your neighbor. Show your rivals you are no laughingstock. Long live North Korean strength, unpredictability and wily intelligence! Her laptop pinged. She pumped her fist: Her two messages were just opened. Three minutes and counting. Sofie forged ahead and considered how best to rile Misha. He represented a coalition that included the Russian government, wealthy oligarchs and criminal gangs. Should she emphasize the financial gain possible with the pairing of her database and the massive storehouse of credit card information that their mafia had already amassed? The opportunity to disrupt Western military, electrical and banking infrastructures? The ability to misinform, divide and reshape Western opinions? She went for the highest stake. Приве́т. Auction for the weapon of the century is ending. The Chinese have sent in a kill bid. I'm obligated to take it, but hey, I make the rules. I'd prefer my database be used to change elections and blackmail hypocritical, holier-than-thou American politicians. And smarmy British toadies. And German rats. You have 90 seconds to win this. With less than 2 minutes left, she considered ignoring Lao Da. The Chinese had ticked her off with two insultingly low ""fill-or-kill"" bids and then threatened to walk away. They returned each time though, unabashed. They had more resources than all of the other bidders combined and were above spear phishing for petty gains. By combining Sofie's database with the 22 million U.S. Office of Personnel Management files in their possession, they could steal intellectual properties and military secrets at will for their industrial and state-owned operations. The Russians have come to play with a cool billion. Can you do better??? You have 30 seconds to enter your final bid. Watching her clock tick down, Sofie dug the tip of her father's lucky Montblanc — the one he reserved for his second set of books — into her thigh. She smiled picturing him tossing his apartment for it and cursing her. At 00:30, her message box began to ding. She was right. Auctions happened in the last seconds. Her body went limp with relief. $525 million final bid, $530 million, $505 million and $509 million. The bastards were colluding. Not only did they disregard her billion-dollar threat, their bids were obscenely close. Someone had unlocked the multilayer state-of-the-art security on her site and contacted their rivals. Of course they did. She was dealing with the best hackers in the world. Sofie's head pounded with rage. She should invalidate the auction and start over. The thought depressed her. It had taken her nearly a year to disguise her identity, set up her site, get the word out, vet all the players and create an airtight verification process. Moreover, portions of her data were time sensitive. By colluding, they would all get her database, so why shouldn't they each pay her price? They had invalidated the auction. A new game was in play. A corner of her lip crooked upward as Sofie crafted her message. She congratulated each player for winning the auction at their submitted bid and enclosed an OAuth token — good for 1 minute only — that would unlock the encryption keys to her database upon the transfer of funds. One way or another, she would get her billion dollars."
Op-Ed,2018-12-06,"In the eight years since it was decided, Citizens United has unleashed a wave of campaign spending that by any reasonable standard is extraordinarily corrupt.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/opinion/citizens-united-corruption-pacs.html,2490," In the eight years since it was decided, Citizens United has unleashed a wave of campaign spending that by any reasonable standard is extraordinarily corrupt. To see how this operates in practice, let's take a look at how Paul Ryan, the outgoing speaker of the House, negotiated a path — narrowly constructed to stay on the right side of the law — during a recent fund-raising trip to Las Vegas, as recounted in detail by Politico. In early May, Ryan flew to Nevada to solicit money from Sheldon Adelson — the casino magnate who was by far the largest Republican contributor of 2018 — for the Congressional Leadership Fund, an independent expenditure super PAC. Ryan was accompanied by Norm Coleman, a former Republican Senator from Minnesota. The Leadership Fund, according to its website, is ""a super PAC exclusively dedicated to protecting and strengthening the Republican Majority in the House of Representatives."" It ""operates independently of any federal candidate or officeholder."" Adelson could not legally hand over his check to Ryan, who is a federal officeholder. Incidentally, Adelson's company, Las Vegas Sands, reported a $700 million windfall as a result of the $1.5 trillion tax cut enacted last year by the House under Ryan's supervision. So how did they conduct this delicate transaction? First, Ryan, Coleman and others ""laid out a case to Adelson about how crucial it is to protect the House,"" according to Politico's report. Then Ryan ""left the room, Coleman made the 'ask' and secured the $30 million contribution."" Will behavior like this ""cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy?"" Apparently not, according to Anthony M. Kennedy, the recently retired justice who wrote Citizens United with the backing of four of his colleagues. The crucial section of Citizens United reads as follows: The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate. The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials. This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse ""to take part in democratic governance"" because of additional political speech made by a corporation or any other speaker. Since 2010, when the case was decided, independent expenditures and other forms of outside spending have grown exponentially, according to OpenSecrets. In 2010, independent expenditures totaled $203.9 million; in 2016, it was $1.48 billion. In this nonpresidential year, with final reports still to come, independent expenditures totaled at least $1.18 billion. The surge in outside spending unconstrained by contribution limits is a central element of current campaign finance practice. Dan Eggen, writing in the Washington Post on July 16, 2012, described the state of campaign finance reform more than 40 years after Watergate: Four decades later, there's little need for furtive fund-raising or secret handoffs of cash. Many of the corporate executives convicted of campaign-finance crimes during Watergate could now simply write a check to their favorite super PAC or, if they want to keep it secret, to a compliant nonprofit group. Corporations can spend as much as they want to help their favored candidates, no longer prohibited by law from spending company cash on elections. The political world has, in many respects, come full circle since a botched burglary funded by illicit campaign cash brought down an administration.  Detractors — primarily on the left — have criticized Citizens United and a 2013 appeals court decision based on it, Free Speech v F.E.C., for opening the door to unlimited corporate spending in politics. In fact, there are scholars on both the left and right who agree with Citizens United because they think restricting campaign spending by businesses constitutes an incursion on First Amendment rights that could lead to censorship, for example, of books and newspapers. Laurence Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School, and Joshua Matz, an attorney in private practice, write in their 2014 book Uncertain Justice: The Roberts Court and the Constitution that Allowing government to control who can spend enough to get heard on a grander scale would render freedom of speech illusory. In a 2015 law review article, however, ""Dividing 'Citizens United': The Case v. The Controversy,"" Tribe faulted Citizens United for implausibly downplaying, and at times all but denying, the baleful corruption of American politics by means short of criminal bribery — by means that are lamentable precisely because they are lawful. The key changes in campaign finance practices over the past eight years stem from the ruling in Citizens United and Speech Now that contributions to independent expenditure committees, including super PACs, pose no threat of ""quid pro quo"" political corruption. There is no corruption, Justice Kennedy wrote in Citizens United, because ""an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate."" Roll Call, in a story headlined ""Firewall Between Candidates and Super PACs Breaking Down"" described the myth of non-coordination: The supposed barrier between candidates and unrestricted super PACs is flimsier than ever. As midterm elections approach, complaints are rolling into the F.E.C. from both parties about super PACs that share vendors, fund-raisers and video footage with the politicians they support. Along the same lines, a 2015 note in the Harvard Law Review concluded: Candidate assistance with super PAC fund-raising efforts has pushed at the boundaries of this legally mandated independence, allowing a level of coordination that many observers believe creates a real threat of quid pro quo corruption. The detrimental role super PACs play in campaigns prompted Albert W. Alschuler, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, and three colleagues — including Tribe — to argue in a 2017 working paper that the negative attack ads spawned by super PACS are in themselves corrosive and provide adequate grounds to ban such PACs and the unlimited contributions that fund them: Although these groups may not coordinate their expenditures with those of an official campaign, their managers often understand that their job is to attack an opponent while the candidate they support takes a higher road. Super PACs have been called ""the attack dogs and provocateurs of modern politics."" The advertisements they produce contribute to the nation's cynicism about politics, a cynicism that runs especially deep among young people. The candidates they support need not take responsibility for what they say, and the groups usually disappear once an election is over. A strong critic of the Supreme Court decision, Sanford Levinson, a member of the law school faculty and the department of government at the University of Texas, argued in an email to me that: Citizens United reveals the importance of having a Supreme Court completely devoid of a single individual who has ever participated in electoral politics. This helps to reinforce, I believe, the tendency of the Justices to think in terms of arid formalistic abstractions — including Kennedy's views about corporations and the First Amendment — rather than address the actual realities of our political system. Robert C. Post, a professor at Yale Law School, also views Justice Kennedy's views as exceptionally shortsighted, declaring in a 2013 lecture that It is the height of hubris for the Court, by a vote of five justices on a bench of nine, simply to dismiss concerns for electoral integrity on the ground that electoral integrity is a question of law rather than of social fact. Fred Wertheimer — the president of Democracy 21, who has ""participated as a lawyer in every major Supreme Court case starting with Buckley v Valeo,"" a key 1976 post-Watergate campaign finance decision — took this argument a step further. He wrote me: The Roberts majority on the Supreme Court has consistently failed to have a clue about the consequences of its campaign finance decisions and the ways in which their decisions in Citizens United and McCutcheon opened the door to the return of the corrupting contributions that led to the Watergate campaign finance scandals in the 1970s and the 'soft money' campaign finance scandals of the 1990s. In McCutcheon, the court ruled that aggregate limits on the total amount an individual could give to federal candidates in every two year cycle — $123,200 in 2013-14 — were unconstitutional. In one section of a detailed critique he sent me, Wertheimer wrote: The Court in Citizens United stated, ""Limits on independent expenditures, such as (the ban on corporate expenditures) have a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government's interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption. The anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question."" This is a remarkably misguided statement in that the Court is asserting that the foundational need of our nation to be able to protect itself from the corruption of our government is outweighed by the constitutional right of a corporation to make unlimited expenditures to influence elections. The court, Wertheimer continued, was ""misguided and naïve"" in making the assertion in Citizens United without citing a single piece of evidence for this finding that ""the appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in this democracy."" In the face of all this criticism, does Justice Kennedy, the now-retired author of Citizens United, have any second thoughts? Rick Hasen, a campaign finance expert at the University of California-Irvine's law school, told me that as recently as last week, Kennedy expressed no regrets. When Kennedy was asked in an interview at the University of Virginia, Hasen wrote, ""if, in the wake of the huge influx of money into elections, he had any regrets about his majority opinion in Citizens United v. FEC, he said the decision 'stands for itself'. "" Bob Bauer, a Democratic campaign finance lawyer who is now a law professor at N.Y.U., wrote me that the Supreme Court's intervention in the political process has been defined by a lack of prescience or success. What the majority in Citizens United had to say about corporate independent expenditures and the risk of corruption seemed entirely divorced from reality. The court has created a world in which both the parties and candidates can indirectly but effectively raise and benefit from unlimited donations purportedly expended on an ""independent basis."" Justice Kennedy, Bauer continued, put considerable faith in disclosure requirements as the antidote to any potential problems of corruption — and then had to concede later that he was surprised that disclosure is ""not working the way it should."" It was fairly predictable that it wouldn't. Post contended that in many respects Citizens United is a failed attempt to address a problem created by Buckley v. Valeo. In his 2013 Tanner lecture, Post made the following argument: Because Buckley prohibited the state from regulating independent expenditures while allowing it to regulate contributions, it ""produced a system in which candidates face an unlimited demand for campaign funds (because expenditures generally cannot be capped) but a constricted supply (because there is often a ceiling on the amount each contributor can give) … The result is an unceasing preoccupation with fund-raising."" (Post was quoting from ""The Hydraulics of Campaign Finance Reform"" by Samuel Issacharoff and Pamela S. Karlan.) Citizens United has turned campaign finance into a system universally disdained by the public, a system even more ethically unmoored than the one obtained before Watergate in the days when, to quote Eggen again: The money poured into Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign from all corners: Six-figure checks flown by corporate jet from Texas; bundles of payments handed over at an Illinois game preserve; a battered brown attaché case stuffed with $200,000 in cash from a New Jersey investor hoping to fend off a fraud investigation. The difference now is that the checks are bigger. How did this come about? Essentially, by legal fiat: a declaration by five Supreme Court justices that what looks, smells and feels like corruption is not in fact corruption. Tribe has summed up the decision succinctly: The Supreme Court's sin in Citizens United is not that it has been wrong to recognize and embrace the libertarian values that inhere in the First Amendment. But the libertarian campaign finance law the Court has developed fails in the broader project vital to First Amendment jurisprudence: the sensitive accommodation of competing constitutional values. The Court has not only underemphasized the egalitarian strain in First Amendment law — it has rejected that strain outright. And it has failed to recognize the range of plainly legitimate conceptions of democracy that Americans hold, instead privileging one view, democracy-by-financial-contributions, above all others. The likelihood that the current conservative majority would take into account the ""egalitarian strain in First Amendment law,"" as described by Tribe, is zero. In Citizens United, the court pointedly overturned a 1990 ruling, Austin v Michigan Chamber of Commerce. In doing so, the court explicitly rejected the finding in Austin that regulation of corporate political spending is justified as a legitimate means of remedying the inequity that grows out of the fact that state-created advantages not only allow corporations to play a dominant role in the Nation's economy, but also permit them to use ""resources amassed in the economic marketplace"" to obtain ""an unfair advantage in the political marketplace."" The American system of campaign finance, undergirded by a Supreme Court whose conservative members feign innocence, has become the enabler of corrosive processes of economic and political inequality. Surely the justices are not benighted enough to believe that Paul Ryan and his ilk have no idea what they are doing. In this context, Tribe writes: The Citizens United Court took the narrowest possible view of corruption, maintaining that the only legitimate government interest in this field is the prevention of quid pro quo corruption. But, as many have argued in response, quid pro quo corruption is far too narrow a governmental interest to identify as constitutionally relevant. It is an interest that does not begin to reflect the full stakes at issue in the campaign finance realm: the health of American democracy itself. Unless the notion of interests sufficiently compelling to count in the First Amendment calculus is strangely truncated to exclude interests this fundamental simply because they appear imprecise or diffuse, courts must recognize a compelling interest in combating corruption broadly defined as a distortion in the political process, understood to include a deviation from the ideal of equal representation embodied in Federalist 57. Tribe's view is shared by Martin Gilens, a political scientist at Princeton, who wrote in ""Affluence and Influence: Economic Inequality and Political Power in America"": As resources flow toward the already most advantaged Americans, their ability to use those resources to shape policy increases. Of course rich Americans hold diverse preferences, just as the poor and the middle class. But despite some prominent liberal counterexamples, rich Americans tend to support the economic policies from which they have so greatly benefited. This raises the disturbing prospect of a vicious cycle in which growing economic and political inequality are mutually reinforcing. We are seeing that vicious cycle in operation today, with a Supreme Court incapable of applying either reason or common sense to stop the madness. I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.

News,2018-12-06,"A steep slide followed by a strong recovery whipsawed investors on Thursday, as concerns about the global economy, trade tensions and interest rates kept markets on edge.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/business/stocks-wall-street-huawei-trade.html,838," A steep slide followed by a strong recovery whipsawed investors on Thursday, as concerns about the global economy, trade tensions and interest rates kept markets on edge. Stocks fell around the world after the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive intensified concerns that China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, could be entering a risky new chapter in their trade dispute. But Wall Street recovered most of those losses in an afternoon rally predicated on the prospect that the Federal Reserve may slow down on interest rate increases next year. At one point in the day, the S&P 500 was down as much as 2.9 percent, mirroring steep declines in Asia and Europe. A recovery late in the trading day, however, left the index down only about 0.2 percent at the closing bell. The dueling messages continued on Friday morning in Asia, where markets were mixed and futures that predict Wall Street's opening showed a modest drop. The worldwide drop was set off by news that the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, had been arrested in Canada at the request of the United States. Her detention on Saturday, the same day President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to a trade truce, could further complicate efforts to resolve a dispute that has weighed on financial markets in recent weeks. In recent days, skepticism had already grown about prospects for that 90-day truce, as Trump administration aides played down the chances of striking a broad deal and Mr. Trump threatened further tariffs on imports from China, even calling himself a ""Tariff Man"" in messages on Twitter. But the arrest of Ms. Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, threatened to open a riskier new chapter in a fight that investors increasingly see as a threat to financial markets and the economy. ""This is going to continue to be a headwind at a time when people are worried about global growth,"" said Dan Clifton, a head of policy research with the analysis firm Strategas. For most of the year, the United States — less reliant on trade than most wealthy nations — had been a global standout, thanks in part to a burst of fiscal stimulus from the Trump tax cuts, while the trade war caused trouble in the rest of the world's financial markets. In China, where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in almost a decade, stocks have slumped more than 20 percent. Export-based economies that are closely tied to China — like Japan and Germany — have started to struggle too. Growth in emerging markets, which often supply the commodities that have fueled the Chinese boom in recent decades, has also been hurt. But in recent weeks, worry about the trade war has begun to take hold in the United States as well. Since its peak in late September, the S&P 500 has declined by 8 percent, as investors grew concerned about the outlook for corporate profits, the potential costs of the trade spat and rising interest rates, which are traditionally viewed as a negative for stocks. The outlook for interest rates shifted suddenly on Thursday, when The Wall Street Journal published an article saying Federal Reserve officials were considering emphasizing a ""wait-and-see"" approach to future rate increases at the central bank's meeting later this month. Although this message was in line with previous Fed comments, the stock market began to recover soon after the article was published. The rally did little for investors in energy shares. The sector has been hard hit by a slump in crude oil prices in recent weeks and was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500 on Thursday. Prices for benchmark American crude oil fell more than 2 percent on Thursday, as OPEC ended its meeting on Thursday without reaching a deal to reduce oil output, even as Saudi Arabia pressed for production cuts. Exxon Mobil and Chevron both dropped more than 1 percent. Elsewhere, yields on government bonds dropped sharply early in the day as investors flocked to the safety of Treasury debt. But the declines in yields moderated late in the day, in tandem with the shift in stock trading. Bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, tend to drop as investors downgrade expectations for growth and inflation. Those lower yields can crimp the profitability of banks, which charge interest rates that are based on government bond yields. The threat of such pressures has hammered American financial stocks in recent days. The S&P 500 financial sector index was the second-worst-performing part of the market on Thursday, dropping 1.4 percent. And while few expect a hasty end to the economic expansion in the United States, the recent swings in stocks suggest investors are increasingly worrying about any threats that could worsen growth forecasts. ""There's a bit of a growth slowdown in place,"" said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock. ""This is a very different environment from where we were this time last year."""
News,2018-12-06,Good Thursday. Want this by email? Sign up here.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/business/dealbook/facebook-email-data.html,1932," Good Thursday. Want this by email? Sign up here. A cache of emails and other internal Facebook documents made public by a British parliamentary committee on Wednesday revealed how the social media giant used people's personal data to favor some of its partners and to punish rivals. The 250 pages of material, from 2012 to 2015, had been sealed by a U.S. judge as part of a lawsuit filed against Facebook by an app developer, but they were obtained by British lawmakers as part of a parliamentary investigation into the company's practices. Some highlights: Facebook engineered ways to collect data without telling users. In one exchange, employees discussed a possible app update that would log users' phone calls. ""This is a pretty high risk thing to do from a P.R. perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it,"" Michael LeBeau, an employee, said in one email. Mark Zuckerberg approved cutting off a competitor's data access. In 2013, after Twitter released the video app Vine, Facebook ended Twitter's access to friends data. ""Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today,"" Justin Osofsky, a Facebook executive, said in an email at the time. The response from Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive: ""Yup, go for it."" Data was prized above almost everything else. ""Sometimes the best way to enable people to share something is to have a developer build a special purpose app or network for that type of content and to make that app social by having Facebook plug into it,"" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a 2012 email. ""That may be good for the world, but it's not good for us unless people also share back to Facebook and that content increases the value of our network."" Facebook said the documents had been cherry-picked to show the company in an unfavorable light. ""Like any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform,"" the company said. ""But the facts are clear: We've never sold people's data."" More Facebook news: The company's board said it was ""entirely appropriate"" for Sheryl Sandberg to investigate whether George Soros had shorted the company's stock. And internal tensions at the social network are reportedly becoming far more intense. Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese tech giant Huawei and the daughter of the company's founder, was arrested in Canada on Saturday at the request of the U.S. Context: The U.S. government, which views Huawei as a national security threat, has taken steps to restrict the use of the company's technology and has been lobbying other countries to do the same. Just this week, a major British telecommunications company announced it would strip Huawei hardware from its core 4G network. Why it matters: Given that Huawei is one of China's corporate jewels, Ms. Meng's detention would most likely increase tensions between Beijing and Washington as they start new trade negotiations. What happens next in this high-stakes game? ""The U.S. Department of Justice and the Trump administration have an important question to answer,"" Tim Culpan of Bloomberg Opinion writes. ""What do we want out of this?"" The wrong decision could escalate the trade war at a time both nations are hoping for peace. A travel note for U.S. executives: ""They will retaliate and China will take hostages,"" James Lewis, director of technology policy at the think tank CSIS told Axios. ""If I was an American tech executive, I wouldn't travel to China this week."" President Trump said yesterday that the Chinese government was sending ""very strong signals"" about what might emerge from the trade truce he and President Xi Jinping reached last weekend in Buenos Aires. The comment was apparently a reference to remarks of Beijing being ""confident"" a comprehensive deal can be reached before a tariff freeze expires in 90 days. Plenty of people are unconvinced. More from Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley of the NYT: • ""Mr. Trump and his advisers have been touting the trade truce reached in Buenos Aires as a victory, saying that China had agreed to buy $1.2 trillion worth of American products."" • ""But trade experts and industry insiders remain perplexed, anxiously awaiting information about the timing and composition of the $1.2 trillion, a number that dwarfs the $130 billion in goods that the United States exported to China last year."" • ""If China doubled the amount of goods it bought from the United States starting next year, it would take nearly a decade to reach the $1.2 trillion goal."" OPEC officials are meeting in Vienna today, and it's a tricky time for the oil industry, writes Stanley Reed of the NYT. Why it matters: Oil prices have swung wildly in recent months, with crude tumbling 35 percent to less than $50 a barrel before rebounding slightly this week. The industry would like to lift prices by restricting production, but Mr. Trump has been explicit about wanting to keep prices low. What to expect: ""Most analysts say that the oil producers have little choice but to announce a substantial cut in production of at least one million barrels a day, or around 1 percent of world oil supplies,"" Mr. Reed writes. ""Otherwise, prices could slide into the $40-a-barrel range or lower, squeezing the oil-dependent economies of member countries."" What can go wrong: The future of Russian oil production and the amount of Iranian oil that U.S. sanctions will take off the market could still sway prices. There's a huge business opportunity in climate change. Exploiting it is the hard part. In a climate change report published yesterday, scientists likened the quickening growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions to a ""speeding freight train,"" and warned that the world may face some of global warming's most severe consequences sooner than expected. Greg Ip of the WSJ outlines what that means for businesses: ""Worries don't translate into solutions unless businesses devise products that emit dramatically less planet-warming greenhouse gases. The innovation is the easy part; getting people to buy it is the hard part. That requires incentives, which depend heavily on governments. Without their intervention, solar and wind power, and electric and hybrid cars would have no foothold against their fossil fuel competitors."" But he also notes that many government interventions aren't sufficiently informed by long-term thinking. Tom Linebarger, the chief executive of the engine maker Cummins, tells Mr. Ip that there's an obvious path forward. ""If we want rules that are more effective, decide the end result we want and let technology compete for the best solution,"" he said. ""Carbon taxes are much better than all the other choices."" The U.S. markets were closed yesterday in honor of former President George Bush. When they reopen today, there could be bad news. Global markets have slumped. After dropping yesterday, they did so again today. The Nikkei in Japan fell about 2 percent, and the pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell over 2 percent in morning trading. Futures tracking U.S. stocks aren't encouraging. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow all appear set to open with losses of more than 1.5 percent today. What's driving the malaise? Trade concerns are playing a big role, and the arrest of Meng Wanzhou of Huawei added to unease about the prospects for the U.S.-China trade truce. The flattening yield curve, which is seen as an early indicator of a looming recession, is also having an impact. Add to that more general fears of a slowing global economy, Brexit and a troubled tech sector. A new study by UBS suggests worldwide unemployment was 5.2 percent in September. That's down from 8 percent in 2010, and the lowest level since 1980. More on the numbers from the FT: Arend Kapteyn, UBS chief economist, said that greater labor market flexibility since the financial crisis — due to factors such as lower wages and the advent of the gig economy — had helped lower the natural rate of unemployment in many countries. The change has been particularly pronounced in Eastern Europe: Polish unemployment has fallen to 6.2 percent from 20 percent in 2002, for instance, and Croatia and Slovakia have similar stories. But unemployment has dropped in many of the largest economies too, including the U.S., Britain, Germany and Japan. Robert Dickey, C.E.O. of the newspaper publisher Gannett, plans to retire by May. Martin Anstice, C.E.O. of Lam Research, has resigned amid allegations of misconduct in the workplace.

News,2018-12-06,"LONDON — The British government is preparing to suspend a special visa program that allows wealthy investors to fast-track their settlement in the country, part of a new drive to crack down on money laundering.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/world/europe/uk-golden-visa-suspended.html,696," LONDON — The British government is preparing to suspend a special visa program that allows wealthy investors to fast-track their settlement in the country, part of a new drive to crack down on money laundering. The Tier 1 visas will be suspended from midnight on Dec. 7 until the Home Office introduces tighter restrictions to tackle corruption and organized crime. ""We will not tolerate people who do not play by the rules and seek to abuse the system,"" Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said in a statement on Thursday. They are not called ""golden visas"" for nothing. They provide a faster route for wealthy investors coming from outside the European Union and Switzerland to settle in Britain. The program was introduced in 2008 to attract wealthy foreign nationals willing to invest large amounts of capital in Britain. Billions of pounds have poured into London over the past decade, following an influx of global elites who have benefited from the program. It peaked in 2014, after 1,172 visas were granted. The visa program has been especially popular among Russian oligarchs and wealthy people from China and the United Arab Emirates. More than 1,000 investment visas were granted in the 12-month period ending in September 2018. To qualify, foreign nationals must put down a minimum of 2 million pounds (around $2.5 million) as an investment in Britain. Such an investment in United Kingdom bonds, share capital or companies allows investors to apply for permanent residency within five years. For a £5 million investment, they can apply for permanent residency after three years. An investment of £10 million can open the door to permanent residency after two years. After that, the nationals theoretically could apply for citizenship. The visa program has always had its critics, with anticorruption campaigners railing against Britain's openness to ill-gotten riches from overseas and the foreigners who invest them. But it reached a fever pitch after a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, was poisoned on British soil with a nerve agent in Salisbury, England. Prime Minister Theresa May's government signaled then that it would review the cases of 700 Russians who were granted visas to live in Britain under the Tier 1 visa scheme. Soon afterward, the visa renewal for the Russian billionaire owner of the Chelsea football team, Roman Abramovich, was mysteriously delayed. Mr. Abramovich later surfaced in Israel, where he had apparently immigrated under the law of return, which guarantees citizenship to any Jew wanting to move there. Criticism of the program can be traced as far back as 2014, after visa applications soared. The government's Migration Advisory Committee filed a report that said the scheme brought limited economic benefits because most of the investors had bought fixed-interest loan securities known as gilts, meaning that they were effectively loaning the government money instead of investing in the country. ""We do not need such investment to fund the deficit. We are selling around £300 million of gilts every day — therefore the capital market is working very efficiently,"" the report said. While investors and their families spend money in Britain and generate revenue, the favorable impacts are typically exaggerated, the committee found. As the benefits were being questioned, the authorities grew concerned over the origins of funds being invested into the country. This year, the government introduced ""unexplained wealth orders,"" forcing those suspected of serious crimes to explain the provenance of their wealth and assets. The National Crime Agency estimated that £100 billion in ""dirty money"" was being funneled into Britain each year, mainly from Russian, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Far East. After the visa program is suspended on Friday, the Home Office will conduct an investigation before reintroducing it with stricter regulations. Under the new rules, visa applicants will have to provide audits of all their financial and business interests using firms registered in the United Kingdom, and show that they have had control of their funds for at least two years, the Home Office said. Changes will also be introduced to increase the benefits of the investment to British companies."

I have a plan to afford it, but it would be much easier if my parents (in their 80s) gave me an ""advance"" on the money they will leave me. I hate to sound crass, but I'd like to enjoy some of it while they're alive — maybe even host a family gathering. I asked my older sister, who has financial power of attorney for them. She thought it should be structured as a loan with a minimal interest rate. But when my parents helped with her kids' education, years ago, there was no loan. Am I being petty? I intend to speak to my parents, but I'd love your input. KATHY Here's the thing about your parents' money: It's theirs! Asking for an advance on your inheritance is crass, for sure, but worse, it may hurt their feelings — as if you were licking your chops in anticipation of their death. (And I'm sure you're not.) So, let's find another way. You don't say how well off your parents are, how much of their savings they may need in the future or whether the power of attorney is already in effect. If you are sure that they are still competent to make this decision and can afford it, ask for a loan. Let them decide whether to make it a gift. And drop the tit-for-tat with your sister over her children's education. That help was given at another time and probably long planned. My biggest reservation here is that many parents I know would go without to help their children (even deep into adulthood). If that sounds like yours, stick with your original plan to pay for the house yourself. There comes a time to put our parents first, after years of the reverse arrangement. That time may have come, Kathy. When I first began dating my girlfriend, about a year ago, I told her I would always cook for her. (I was a decent cook in college.) She was very into this idea. But every time I cook for her I get something wrong. She's never had a decent meal that came from my kitchen. And when she's not around, my meals come out beautifully! What can I do? SOPHIE Other than relax? This is called performance anxiety, Sophie, and many of us suffer from it. Give me a bucket of balls and a deserted tennis court, and I serve like Serena Williams. Put someone on the other side of the net, and I double-fault all afternoon. Try turning down the pressure on yourself. On the tennis court, I play points without keeping score. In the kitchen, enlist your girlfriend's help. A cassoulet made by two may be a less freighted enterprise for you. Once you've got a few decent meals under your belt, I imagine you'll be back to cooking as well as ever. (And a nice glass of Barolo probably wouldn't hurt.) My husband, our young son and I have a house in the country, a few hours from our primary residence. We don't get there often because of our heavy workloads. But when we do, our neighbors (who also have a young child) are at our door within 10 minutes of our arrival. The kids are happy to see each other. But my husband and I would like to settle in and enjoy some downtime together rather than immediately hear stories about our neighbors' lives since the last time we saw them. How do we maintain a friendly relationship and stop the uninvited visits? ANONYMOUS Here's a wild suggestion: the truth! Boundaries don't appear by magic; we set them. The next time your neighbors bound over, say, ""How nice to see you! Let us settle in, and maybe we can grab a drink later?""  Let the kids play. Relax with your husband. And invite the neighbors over for a glass of wine at night or coffee the next day. If you don't like them turning up uninvited, you have to let them know. Just be neighborly about it. My best friend from childhood married a dunderhead who thinks it's funny to post unflattering pictures of her on Instagram without her knowledge. The photos are often of her sleeping or wearing pajamas. He also writes posts that paint her in a poor light. Initially, he lied to her about this. (Their pastor even got involved!) But he's still posting about her regularly. I'd like to rat him out. But would that be meddling in their marriage? ANONYMOUS If your friend confided in you about this problem, it's reasonable to check in with her and let her know that the unappealing photos are still coming fast and furious. But stay out of this mess if you heard about it from a third party.  Your friend is surely aware of her husband's behavior. It doesn't require mad sleuthing skills (or a friend from youth) for her to check his social media feeds occasionally and call him out on his nasty behavior. For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter."
News,2018-12-07,"One day this fall, Ashutosh Garg, the chief executive of a recruiting service called Eightfold.ai, turned up a résumé that piqued his interest.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/business/economy/artificial-intelligence-hiring.html,1667," One day this fall, Ashutosh Garg, the chief executive of a recruiting service called Eightfold.ai, turned up a résumé that piqued his interest. It belonged to a prospective data scientist, someone who unearths patterns in data to help businesses make decisions, like how to target ads. But curiously, the résumé featured the term ""data science"" nowhere. Instead, the résumé belonged to an analyst at Barclays who had done graduate work in physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Though his profile on the social network LinkedIn indicated that he had never worked as a data scientist, Eightfold's software flagged him as a good fit. He was similar in certain key ways, like his math and computer chops, to four actual data scientists whom Mr. Garg had instructed the software to consider as a model. The idea is not to focus on job titles, but ""what skills they have,"" Mr. Garg said. ""You're really looking for people who have not done it, but can do it."" The power of such technology will be immediately apparent to any employer scrambling to fill jobs in a tight labor market — not least positions for data scientists, whom companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are competing to attract. Thanks to services like Eightfold, which rely on sophisticated algorithms to match workers and jobs, many employers may soon have access to a universe of prospective workers — even for hard-to-fill roles — whom they might not otherwise have come across. And while that could also help some candidates, there's a potential downside for job seekers: Such algorithms may also lower wages in these fields, said Bo Cowgill, an economist at Columbia University who has studied the use of artificial intelligence in hiring. ""You get the more nontraditional, equally qualified, equally high-performing people,"" Mr. Cowgill said. But the employer ""doesn't seem to have to compete for them as much."" For years, employers and online intermediaries have used algorithms to help fill job openings, but their methods were often crude. A computer would identify key words on résumés, then determine whether those words corresponded to text in job descriptions. While this approach can be more efficient than manually searching a site like LinkedIn, it has drawbacks. Applicants can game the process by larding their résumés with terms the machines are likely to be looking for. Conversely, poorly worded job listings could cause computers to overlook qualified candidates. But recent advances in a form of artificial intelligence known as deep learning have made the machines used by some companies, like Eightfold and the online job hub ZipRecruiter, far more powerful. Instead of simply scanning words on a page and matching them to words in a job description, a machine can now identify skills and aptitudes that don't explicitly appear on a candidate's résumé. To illustrate, Mr. Garg points out that about 90 percent of software engineers at the financial software company Intuit in Mountain View, Calif., know the programming language Java, according to data Eightfold has analyzed. That means the machine is on safe ground inferring that an Intuit software engineer knows Java, even if he or she doesn't list the skill on a résumé. By performing a similar exercise across an entire résumé, the company's software can build a detailed profile of a job applicant. It can extract more than the usual amount of information from categories like education (certain disciplines at less prominent universities, like natural-language processing at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, produce high-achieving workers) and even hobbies (chess players tend to be good at coding, basketball players at sales). Eightfold, which is based in Silicon Valley, also makes a clever trade with clients: to improve its results, Eightfold asks clients to use its human-resources software, which imports employee data in anonymous form. This includes information on how workers with different backgrounds perform in different jobs, and how much they earn. Eightfold can then use this data to better predict performance — say, how well an Intuit software engineer who plays chess and graduated from the University of Massachusetts might do at Amazon or Microsoft. Intuit did not respond to a request for comment. The software tool can be especially powerful to an employer intent on expanding a search beyond candidates with conventional experience and qualifications. In that case, a recruiter can specify criteria (like industry and location, and even how likely the candidate is to accept an offer) that would turn up less traditional résumés. Claudia Villanueva, a recruiting and diversity official at AdRoll Group, which helps clients with digital ads and marketing, said she recently used Eightfold when trying to fill a financial-planning position. The top candidate had experience in industries the tech world often shuns, like manufacturing. But the Eightfold algorithm flagged her as a winner. ""The tech industry sometimes has a hard time moving past tech experience,"" Ms. Villanueva said. ""We keep hiring the same people in the industry. To me this is a really interesting example of how we broke that cycle a bit."" In the case of the Barclays analyst, Eightfold's software pegged him as a budding data scientist partly because he had a master's degree in statistics and knew computer programming languages like C++ and Matlab, even though he had no apparent background in data science. ""We have gone ahead and analyzed tens of millions to hundreds of millions of profiles of people to see how people have moved in their career,"" Mr. Garg said. ""You can predict what they're likely to do next very easily."" He conceded that the approach worked less well in new or obscure fields with limited data. Steve Goodman, the chief executive of Restless Bandit, another firm that applies artificial intelligence to recruiting, compared the exercise of finding nontraditional candidates to filling a professional sports roster. Sports franchises tend to pay far more for free agents who leave their previous team than for players they draft out of college or high school, because the free agents have a record. But if computers were able to predict the performance of draft picks with relative precision, this could change their calculus. The price of free agents might drop, and the price of signing a draft pick would rise. This is, in effect, what software can accomplish using artificial intelligence. ""We surface people we think would be good draft picks,"" rather than people doing the same jobs, Mr. Goodman said. ""This person is a little more junior, but based on their career track, people who look like them are cheaper and better for you."" Mr. Cowgill, the Columbia economist, said this logic was largely correct, but with one key wrinkle: According to his research, the gains to the less obviously qualified candidates unearthed by machines can be so large that they offset smaller losses to conventional candidates. In a technical field like software engineering, for example, a dropout from a no-name university could end up making a very comfortable living after becoming known to employers. But established coders are sufficiently in demand that wages are likely to remain high even as it becomes easier to find alternatives. In fields requiring fewer technical skills, on the other hand, wages could fall significantly. Consider, say, senior marketing jobs, for which large companies often require a master's degree in business administration. If machines can reliably identify less experienced, less credentialed candidates who are likely to excel, it could depress wages. ""You can think of cases in the product market where people thought they needed something special and you really didn't — the commodity, low-cost person took over,"" said John Horton, a labor economist at N.Y.U. Think of hand-held video cameras after the proliferation of smartphones. ""That could happen in labor markets with the realization that you don't need anything special here,"" Mr. Horton said. All of this presumes, however, that deep-learning technology is viable for use in recruiting and human resources and could eventually become commonplace. Surveys suggest that only a small minority of companies have adopted these tools, and that even fewer feel prepared to exploit them. A recent paper summarizing the findings of a conference at the University of Pennsylvania, involving roughly 20 employers, cited a variety of problems. Among them were the difficulty of measuring employees' performance and the sense of unfairness that workers might feel if a computer were to make hiring, firing and promotion decisions. Perhaps the greatest concern is a basic methodological point — call it the N.B.A. problem. If you were studying National Basketball Association players to figure out what makes one great, you would find almost no correlation between performance and height. Almost everyone in this rarefied world is taller than average. And those who aren't compensate with other gifts, like unusual speed and athleticism. If, on the other hand, you selected people at random from the general population and gauged their basketball potential, you would find that it was highly correlated with height. The concern is that machines are, in effect, only studying N.B.A. players — the people who already have jobs at a company, or even the people who sought jobs — not the general population. Mr. Cowgill believes there are solutions. He wrote a paper showing that seemingly unqualified applicants whom a company accidentally interviews allow a machine to simulate a crude randomized experiment, helping the company learn more about what makes a good employee. But perhaps more telling is that sophisticated technology companies are already using artificial intelligence to help fill jobs. Mr. Garg, who worked as a research scientist at Google for four years, says the company uses such techniques in its recruiting. Google says it uses machines to take a second look at résumés in its database that human recruiters may have missed for a limited set of roles. The advantage that a vendor like Eightfold has, Mr. Garg asserted, is access to internal data at dozens of other companies, something even Google can't claim. ""We now can build much deeper models than these companies can build by themselves,"" he said."

Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/us/politics/huawei-arrest-china.html,572," Good Friday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. _____________________ • Meng Wanzhou, a top Chinese technology executive, was arrested in Canada at the request of U.S. officials on Saturday — the same day President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China met to discuss a trade truce. The detention may bolster efforts to contain China and Iran, but it could upend trade talks between the world's two largest economies. • News of Ms. Weng's arrest sent stock markets around the world tumbling on Thursday as concerns of an emerging cold war between the United States and China intensified. • A new study utilizing satellite imagery says North Korea is expanding a missile base that would be one of its most likely sites for deploying intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. • From the earliest days of his campaign, Mr. Trump has railed against undocumented immigrants. But at one of his New Jersey golf clubs, current and former workers say, undocumented immigrants have made his bed, cleaned his toilet and dusted his golf trophies. • Elizabeth Warren's decision to take a DNA test to prove her claims of Native American ancestry was roundly criticized. Publicly, she has stood by her decision. Privately, she and her advisers are worried. • After fraud allegations cast doubt on the fairness and accuracy of the vote count for the Republican nominee Mark Harris in North Carolina's Ninth Congressional District race, a state G.O.P. official is open to the possibility of a new election. • Mr. Trump is strongly considering nominating William P. Barr, who served as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, to return to the post. Mr. Barr is a longtime supporter of strengthening executive power. • In a case with the potential to increase the president's pardon power, the Supreme Court seemed wary of overruling decisions allowing separate prosecutions for the same crimes by state and federal prosecutors. It could have implications for the legal problems faced by Mr. Trump's associates. • Michigan Republicans, following the lead of their Wisconsin counterparts, are forging ahead with several bills that would limit the power of the incoming Democratic secretary of state and set the stage for additional curbs on the Democrats who will take over as governor and attorney general. • In more bad news for Republicans in California, the party conceded a seventh congressional seat in the state with the incumbent David Valadao's defeat. Democrats are now likely to take 40 seats from Republicans as they decisively capture control of the House. • The growth of national health spending, which surged as millions of Americans gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act, is at its lowest since 2013. One contributing factor may be that the share of the population with health insurance has slightly fallen. • Senators and outside groups are putting pressure on Senator Mitch McConnell to take up a bipartisan criminal justice bill addressing sentencing and prison laws before Congress adjourns. But some Republican leaders are being accused of downplaying the bill's support to avoid a vote. _____________________ Today's On Politics briefing was compiled by Margaret Kramer and Isabella Grullón Paz in New York.

News,2018-12-07,"The Labor Department released its monthly hiring and unemployment figures for November on Friday morning, providing one of the better snapshots of the state of the American economy.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/business/economy/jobs-report.html,1296," The Labor Department released its monthly hiring and unemployment figures for November on Friday morning, providing one of the better snapshots of the state of the American economy. ■ 155,000 jobs were added last month. Economists had expected a gain of about 190,000. The monthly average for September, October and November was 170,000. ■ The unemployment rate remained 3.7 percent. ■ Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent after growing by 0.2 percent in October. The year-over-year gain remained 3.1 percent. After a week when the stock market suffered from motion sickness and presidential tweets caused trade tensions to flare, a weaker-than-expected jobs report may have disappointed some quarters. But faulty forecasts do not mean that the labor market has suddenly stalled. For the 98th month in a row, employers increased payrolls, and monthly job gains are still averaging above 200,000 this year. ""It's obviously an economy that is well in expansion mode but that is coming off the boil after a strong second and third quarter,"" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management. ""So the state of the job market is good. It's just that the pace of job creation is slowing a little bit."" Yearly wage growth remained at 3.1 percent for the second month in a row, a level not seen since the recession. ""If you have solid wage growth while productivity is improving, that is the best of both worlds,"" Mr. Donabedian said. Friday's report is unlikely to discourage policymakers at the Federal Reserve from raising benchmark interest rates when they meet on Dec. 18 and 19. Nonetheless, the report is being seen as a warning flag on some fronts. The recent volatility in the stock market and an increase in the monthly average number of people applying for unemployment benefits has worried people, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG. General Motors said last month that it would idle five plants and cut about 14,000 jobs in North America in part because of a slowdown in auto sales. In October, Ford announced plans to trim its work force. Still, Mr. Rupkey labeled the report ""pretty darn good,"" and said it should help calm the markets. Uncertainty about trade policy is the primary source of anxiety. ""The ball is in the president's court to make sure the China deal is still on,"" he said. ""That is the biggest impediment now."" In the meantime, the labor market is mostly delivering. The unemployment rate and new claims for jobless benefits are at or near record lows. And the average monthly increase in payrolls this year is more than enough to keep the jobless rate below 4 percent. ""People who are working in finance are looking at the stock market,"" said Martha Gimbel, research director at the job-search site Indeed. ""The typical worker just wants to find a good job with hours and rising wages."" That search has been getting easier and easier. Ms. Gimbel said sectors that have had a particularly hard time hiring — like nursing and retailing — are now posting more full-time than part-time jobs, a sign that employers are struggling to find workers. ""Even now,"" she added, ""at this point in the recovery, one of the fastest-growing jobs search terms on Indeed is people looking for 'full-time work.'"" The labor shortage has also finally started benefiting workers who were hit hardest during the recession: minimum-wage earners, African-Americans, Latinos and Americans with fewer skills and less education. Gartner, a research and consulting firm that conducts a quarterly survey of 20,000 employees at companies valued at $100 million or more, found that most workers were extremely optimistic about their ability to find new jobs. At the same time, years of sluggish wage growth and fewer opportunities for advancement have made some workers dissatisfied with their current employers. ""Employees who say they are willing to go above and beyond at work has declined,"" said Brian Kropp, vice president for human resources at Gartner. One out of four employees used to say they were giving their work an extra oomph — something Gartner calls ""discretionary effort."" Now, it's closer to one in six. The reason, Mr. Kropp said, is simple: Workers are not being rewarded for their efforts. ""One of the things we've seen is that it's harder for employees to get promoted nowadays,"" he said. In 2006, for example, it took an average of about two and a half years to get a promotion, compared with four and a half years today. Fears about changing jobs have also eased, he said. Workers are more willing to take the risk of hopping to another employer in search of better compensation. Some of the strongest gains to payrolls this year have been in manufacturing — long a buttress of middle-class employment. In November, manufacturers added 27,000 jobs. That comes on top of the nearly 300,000 positions created in the previous 12 months. The scarcity of people with the training and skills to work in some factories has been a challenge, though. At Western Building Products' banana-shaped factory on the lip of the Menomonee River outside of Milwaukee, workers unloaded pallets of door jambs from a large white container truck this week. Elsewhere, employees sanded down doors that hung back-to-back on a moving conveyor belt, a scaled-down, less colorful version of Disney's animated ""Monsters, Inc."" factory. ""If someone is here a year, they never leave,"" said Mark Willey, president of Western, an employee-owned millwork. ""Our problem today is just finding people who want to work, to show up on time and are willing to apply themselves."" The company has 217 people on staff and expects to raise the total to 230 next year. The average worker earns $16.95 an hour, Mr. Willey said, and gets a generous benefits package. Because the business is 100 percent employee-owned, workers build up equity in the company after a year. Western has used temporary agencies after failing to get enough applicants on its own, and employed inmates at a nearby correctional facility as part of a work-release program. ""When they get released, we hire them,"" he said. ""Some we even hire while they're still in."" This has been a good year and the company is scouting locations to build a new factory, but Mr. Willey expects business to cool over the next couple of years. The shortage of competent workers, not only at factories like Western's but also in construction, is slowing single-family home building at the same time that tariffs have bumped up the cost of materials, he said. He pointed to the aluminum sills that ran along the bottom of doors, and the steel hinges bolted onto the sides. The Commerce Department recently reported that construction of single-family homes fell for the second month in a row in October. Manufacturing and related sectors tend to be more susceptible to economic cycles and are particularly vulnerable to tariffs. Mr. Rupkey of MUFG said that manufacturing had been one of the economy's strongest segments in recent years. ""You wonder how long that's going to continue,"" he said, referring to Mr. Trump's trade policies. Most analysts expect the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rates by a quarter-point, to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. It would be the fourth rate increase this year. But they cautioned that it did increase the likelihood that the Fed would take a more cautious approach next year, following through on its announcements to be more ""data dependent"" and look at the numbers as they come as opposed to following a preset course. Snowstorms in the Midwest and raging wildfires in California may have distorted employment data in November. Last month's figures will be revised twice."
News,2018-12-07,"The last weeks that Phyllis Funke could legally make decisions for herself, she climbed into bed, planning to stay there for a while. It was the end of 2016 and she felt disillusioned with the election and wounded by her brother’s recent move to Texas.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/nyregion/court-appointed-guardianship-like-prison.html,4169," The last weeks that Phyllis Funke could legally make decisions for herself, she climbed into bed, planning to stay there for a while. It was the end of 2016 and she felt disillusioned with the election and wounded by her brother's recent move to Texas. She wasn't considering suicide, she said. She just needed to go under the covers until she could figure out how to deal with the rest of her life, so totally alone. She had credit cards, a car, friends and financial advisers in Maine and New York. When a caseworker from Adult Protective Services and a city psychiatrist entered her apartment on March 3, 2017, clipping the security chain because she did not answer the door, she was unraveling emotionally and physically, at risk of becoming homeless or worse. She had no idea what price she would pay for the intervention. ""I've been bullied, blackmailed and stripped of the things I need to live, including my money,"" she said on a recent afternoon. ""Everything has been taken away from me. I have no access to my bank accounts. I don't have the money to pay for the medications that I'm prescribed. I don't get mail. I can't choose my own doctors."" Ms. Funke had entered the world of adult guardianship. In a city like New York, where people are used to looking past their neighbors, how often do you see someone and ask yourself, Is that person O.K.? Should I call someone? Maybe they're older and not moving well. They look adrift in the produce aisle, or you pass their open apartment door and you can't see the floor for the clutter. You're a paramedic and they're refusing to go to the hospital after a bloody fall. It's your mother or your uncle, and you're worried about the bills piling up, or the email scams or the sudden loan to a stranger. You bandage the wound or you promise to check in tomorrow, or you turn away and get on with your life. Or you call Adult Protective Services. After all, that person needs some sort of protection, doesn't she? For Ms. Funke, that call came from the management of her building, after she didn't respond to court motions to evict her for hoarding. Ms. Funke, 77, has a master's degree from Columbia University, a pilot license and — she believes — several hundred thousand dollars in investments, mostly an inheritance from her parents. She is a scuba diver, an avid reader and a global traveler. She has lived in the same cheap apartment for 41 years. If it were up to her, she said, she would be sailing in the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia right now. She is also, in the eyes of New York State, an ""incapacitated person."" She has been deemed unable to manage her personal needs and property, or to understand the danger she had fallen into. What started as a complaint about clutter grew to affect every aspect of her existence, including her right to make basic decisions about her life, own a gun or enter into certain legal contracts. Her appointed guardian, a former police officer, said he was unsure whether Ms. Funke had the right to marry. ""I feel as if I have absolutely no rights at all in the country in which I was born, and therefore in the rest of the world,"" Ms. Funke said. She compared her situation to being in prison, then thought better of it. ""It's worse than incarceration,"" she said. ""At least in prison you have rights."" If you have heard at all about guardianship for older adults, chances are that it has been about a predatory guardian who plunders the estate of a helpless older person. In New York, the poster victim is a Brooklyn judge named John Phillips, whose guardians sold off more than $20 million of his real estate and left him to freeze to death in 2008 in a facility unlicensed to treat people with dementia. Last month, the United States Senate Committee on Aging called for a major overhaul in the guardianship system, warning that ""unscrupulous guardians"" have used their position to get control of vulnerable people and then ""liquidate assets and savings for their own personal benefit."" When I started to look into guardianship, I expected to find many such clear-cut cases. In New York, anyone can petition to have someone declared incapacitated. A judge may then appoint a family member or a third party, usually a lawyer, to be guardian over the person's physical needs, financial affairs or both. Critics of guardianship say these strangers have open license to raid their wards' estates. But as I met families in contested guardianships, more often the conflicts involved sibling infighting, with children battling for control of their aging parents' assets, crying foul if the courts did not side with them. A retired banker in Brooklyn, for instance, was placed under guardianship after two of her children accused a third of stealing from her. Now they are all in court. On Long Island, a son was trying to keep his frail, blind mother at home, battling a daughter and a guardian who wanted to move her to an assisted-living facility. The son blamed his sister and the guardian and the judge and the court evaluator and a real estate broker. On Manhattan's Upper West Side, a mentally ill woman who was living with her mother became homeless after the mother's guardian obtained a court order barring her from the apartment, because he said she was interfering with the mother's care. These families, too, are in court. Guardianship was where the breakdowns of modern life — broken families, broken health, broken finances and broken bureaucracy — tumbled together in a system that appeared to bring out the worst in people: secretive, confusing and run by lawyers, with extraordinary powers over vulnerable individuals. It was also the last defense for lives that had come undone. Then there was Phyllis Funke. Her letter of introduction began, ""Permit me, please, despite the above-noted 'situation,' to introduce myself. (Assuming 'I' still exist; as I trust you'll gather from the accompanying 'tale,' I've an officially appointed guardian who's doing his darnedest to eradicate 'me' — possibly violating New York City and State laws while denying me all my assets, civil rights, and often telephone service)."" Ms. Funke was something different. She was a journalist and had written freelance articles for The Times, among other places. She said she'd reported from more than 150 countries. Her father, Lewis Funke, had been a drama editor and critic at The Times. Roy Cohn, Senator Joseph McCarthy's notorious counselor, was a distant relation; Dick Morris, the controversial former political consultant, was her stepbrother. When the city workers entered her apartment that day, they found her malnourished, dehydrated, unaware that she was under eviction proceedings or that she had not paid the rent in months. There was almost no food in the apartment, and clutter throughout. As Ms. Funke remembered it, ""They asked me who the president was, and I said, do I really have to say that name?"" She could not say how she got in her mental state; maybe it had to do with a lack of sleep. ""I was eating less and less,"" she recalled later. ""I had pasta, and when I ran out of sauce I used Worcestershire sauce. There were cans of tuna but I couldn't find a can opener, so I used a hammer and an awl. ""The closest I can come is to say I dissociated,"" she said. ""I checked out."" In the coming months, while she recuperated in a nursing home, the protective-services agency petitioned the court to declare her incapacitated and place her under guardianship. In court, the city psychiatrist testified that she suffered from ""unspecified bipolar and related disorder, rule out bipolar II disorder, hoarding disorder and unspecified personality disorder."" The designation ""rule out"" means that further examination was needed to rule out the disorder; according to Ms. Funke, no one ever conducted this examination, and the court records do not indicate any further evaluation. At one court hearing she appeared lucid and persuasive; at the next she was barely coherent. The judge, Shawn T. Kelly, appointed a lawyer named Gil V. Perez to be her guardian, and suspended the eviction proceedings. It was for her own good. Nancy Yonge, a friend of Ms. Funke's from Smith College, saw the case differently. She had visited in late 2016, and found Ms. Funke lucid, planning her next travel adventure. ""She had financial advisers locally and in Maine who were looking after her resources,"" Ms. Yonge said. ""I do believe this case is all about the money. If she didn't have money, they wouldn't be after her this way."" By the time I visited Ms. Funke this summer, she said that her dissociative state had passed, and that she was ""sentient."" Her apartment: books galore, yarn sticking out of a cabinet door, couch piled with knitting supplies and a laptop, wall art from her travels, room for two people to sit. Nothing outrageous. The next time I returned the papers had doubled, covering the couch and parts of the floor. She was working on her case, she said. She produced a letter from a psychiatrist declaring her stable and ""perfectly competent to handle all her affairs."" In a country that guarantees the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, at what point does a person forfeit the right to make bad decisions? Some numbers would be helpful here: how many people are in guardianship, what assets they have, how many petitions are accepted or rejected. Unfortunately, those numbers do not exist in any meaningful way. Guardianship records are kept separately by each of New York's 62 counties, with no standardized reporting and no state or city totals. Other states are similar. ""Why are there not systems in place?"" asked Pamela Teaster, director of the Center for Gerontology at Virginia Tech University, who is studying New York's guardianship system. ""When you look for a shirt on the internet, your email will be filled with ads for shirts. We can't track who's under guardianship and their ages and health status."" A ""best guess"" by the National Center for State Courts put the number of people in guardianship nationally at between one million and three million. In Manhattan, a database used by the court lists 2,596 guardianship cases for incapacitated adults, though some of these people may have died. Other numbers do exist. Since last August, when the process started, Ms. Funke has been billed $16,800 by her court-appointed lawyer; $3,437 by a court evaluator, who deemed her in need of guardianship; $5,000 by her first temporary guardian, Mr. Perez, whose original request for $13,790 was slashed by the judge; at least $9,050 by her current guardian, who took over last November; plus money for a geriatric care manager and home attendants, whom Ms. Funke resents. (All fees must be approved by the judge.) Whenever the various players convened, the meter for Ms. Funke ran at close to $1,000 an hour, for a process she did not want. When New York enacted its statute governing guardianship for older or frail adults, Article 81 of the Mental Hygiene Law, in 1992 (a different statute covers people with intellectual or developmental disabilities), it was considered a progressive model, requiring guardians to provide the least restrictive conditions possible and consider their wards' preferences in all decisions. ""It's a great statute,"" said Kristin Booth Glen, a former judge who helped write Article 81 and now advocates for an alternative to guardianship called supported decision making. ""And if people actually applied it, we wouldn't have a lot of people under guardianship. But they don't. That's the problem."" Instead, she said, judges have found it safer to overprotect people, and guardians, who bill their wards at steep hourly rates, have only their own moral incentives to do a good job — their clients are too incapacitated to object, and court monitoring is minimal. How minimal? Though the statute requires guardians to report on their wards' assets and care within 90 days, a study of cases in 14 New York counties found that it took an average of 237 days, and then 210 days before anyone read it. This leaves families feeling powerless and uninformed. Bars to entry are low: in New York, aspiring guardians must complete a one-day certification course. A 2010 report by the federal Government Accountability Office found that the courts conducted no background checks, relying on the applicants to disclose any criminal convictions or recent bankruptcies. Once someone is under guardianship, it is very difficult to get out, because any resistance can be treated as evidence that they are at risk to themselves, so they need protection. For emotionally fragile people, the stress of guardianship — of paying to have your rights transferred to someone else — can make them even more fragile. And if a relative opposes a guardian's actions, everyone involved — the guardian, lawyers for both the guardian and the ward, the court evaluator and possibly others — can bill the ward for their time. ""It's total overkill, it's completely unconstitutional and it's done every day,"" Ms. Glen said. ""And it's done in the name of protection. And the real question is, does it actually protect people? There's no evidence that it does. When you give one person total power over another person's life, including the power to isolate that person, you're setting them up for abuse and neglect and exploitation."" Guardians and judges complain that the system is vastly underfunded, and that most wards have little or no assets to pay for time-consuming work. Several nonprofit organizations provide guardianship for poor individuals. Jean Callahan, who oversees low-income guardianship cases as attorney in charge at the Legal Aid Society's Brooklyn neighborhood office, likened guardianship to nursing homes. ""It's not what anyone would choose, but I'm glad they're there,"" she said. ""It's a blunt instrument, but it does solve problems sometimes."" Even then, though, it transforms one sort of bad situation — the descent into helplessness — into another, which is a supported death. There are no happy outcomes. Phyllis Ellen Funke grew up in the Parkchester section of the Bronx and later Mount Vernon, a high-achieving teenager with a lust for travel and occasional bouts of depression. She wanted to be an actress, she said, but turned to journalism after her father threatened to thwart her in order to protect her from the casting couch. ""He would never believe there was an editing couch,"" she said, alleging a demand for sex from an editor at a major Jewish publication. She mentioned other people who sabotaged her career or wounded her. It was a theme of her conversation. ""She doesn't have delusions,"" her brother, Michael, said. ""She can have strong opinions."" Friends thought she never got over her father's disapproval. She got writing assignments from prestigious publications but never turned them into an income of more than $5,000 or $6,000 a year. Her rent, set at 30 percent of her net income, once dropped to $97 a month. ""I remember almost constant complaining about her father,"" said Morton Fleischner, a friend from journalism school who went on to be a producer at ABC News. Ms. Funke traveled and wrote and traveled and wrote. She acquired stuff on her travels and put it in her apartment, and acquired research materials for future trips and put these in her apartment as well. She bought scuba gear from the shop next door. She bought yarn for knitting. In 2004, the building moved to evict her for hoarding, but her parents helped her tidy up. Bill Lambrecht, 81, a neighbor and friend for more than 30 years, dismissed her clutter as a harmless eccentricity. ""Her apartment was always really messy,"" he said. ""I'd see pennies on the floor, clothes shoved everywhere. She doesn't hoard things. She just throws things on the floor."" Mr. Lambrecht accompanied Ms. Funke to a court conference this August. He had been a guardian for an older woman once, and did not think Ms. Funke needed that level of oversight. At the conference, Judge Kelly called Ms. Funke ""a brilliant woman,"" but he added, on the guardianship question, ""That ship has sailed."" The judge offered to address any problems she was having with her new guardian, Charles Barbuti, adding that this was not the time to reopen the case — for that she had to fill out a form called an Order to Show Cause. He had explained that last time, Judge Kelly said. Ms. Funke began at the beginning. Digressions opened into other digressions. When Judge Kelly stopped her, she simply started again. ""I'm begging you,"" Judge Kelly said. ""I have spent more time on your case than on any single other case on my docket."" He ended the conference to hear the next case. Mr. Lambrecht said: ""She's lucid, intelligent and knows how to take care of herself, mostly. She never cuts to the chase on things. But she's not a bad person in any way. She's very lonely. She's what you'd call a noodge."" Outside the courtroom Ms. Funke snagged Mr. Barbuti. ""I need money to pay for my medication."" ""Send me the bills, I'll pay them."" She could not do this, she said, for a simple reason. ""I'm not taking the medication."" It was a standoff. Mr. Barbuti billed $250 an hour. Sheila O'Brien, the geriatric care manager, stood by. She billed $150 an hour, plus $75 an hour for travel time to and from her office in Connecticut. The judge ordered home-care aides to tackle Ms. Funke's clutter — twice a week, four hours each time. Ms. Funke wanted to hire a cleaning service instead. Often she refused to allow the home attendants into her apartment. This was seen as noncompliance, further grounds to continue guardianship. ""I want to see this work for you, I really do,"" Judge Kelly told her. ""I know you don't want this. Help me make it work."" If you made that call to Adult Protective Services about Ms. Funke, did you do the right thing? The initial intervention brought her back from the edge of malnutrition and dehydration. Judge Kelly stopped the eviction proceedings and ordered help to keep the clutter from returning. But at what cost? In Ms. Funke's view, the process was an assault on her liberty — and in one instance, on her person. Before a court hearing last November, when she refused to get out of bed, the guardian, Gil Perez, forced the issue. What happened is in dispute. Ms. Funke said Mr. Perez dragged her out of bed, slammed her head repeatedly against the wall, then dragged her out toward the elevator in her nightgown. At the hearing that day, Judge Kelly noted that she was disheveled and unresponsive. ""Ms. Funke,"" he said, ""you just don't seem yourself to me today."" Mr. Perez did not respond to requests for comment. At the hearing he told the judge, ""Today, getting her to this court was quite an adventure."" Ms. Funke said nothing. Nathan Villada, a paramedic who was helping Ms. Funke after her initial crisis, cleaning the apartment and taking her to medical appointments, said Mr. Perez was physical but not violent in the way she described. ""This was when Phyllis was doing really, really badly mentally,"" Mr. Villada said. ""She was yelling obscenities and it seemed like she was making aggressive movements toward him. So Gil started grabbing her hands. And that just made her more aggressive. Gil pushed her against the bookshelf more as a restraint, not slamming her. My personal preference, I don't think there's a necessity to touch someone like that. She started yelling out, 'Help, help, I'm being raped.' He pushed her out into the hallway, but he didn't drag her on the floor."" Ms. Yonge said Ms. Funke had called her at the time and told her about the episode, describing it as an ""assault."" ""She was in tears about it,"" Ms. Yonge said. Over time, Ms. Funke began to see this encounter as the root of her problems, and all the court's interventions as more harmful than helpful. If she hadn't been roughed up, she wouldn't have been listless in court that day. If she hadn't been listless, she would have persuaded the judge that she did not need a guardian. Ms. Funke also said that a social worker from Adult Protective Services propositioned her and touched her inappropriately, and that Mr. Villada and his girlfriend had stolen from her. Whatever the validity of her charges, the anguish she feels is clearly real. Mr. Barbuti, who succeeded Mr. Perez as her guardian, said he had not looked into her charges. That was police work, he said, and he was no longer in that line. (He was a captain in the Bronx until he retired in 2011.) ""I can't subpoena people,"" he said. ""Interviewing people and giving Miranda warnings are far beyond the ambit of what I can do."" It can all be maddening. Claude Pepper, a congressman from Florida, once called guardianship ""the most punitive civil penalty that can be levied against an American citizen, with the exception, of course, of the death penalty."" One day in her apartment, Ms. Funke tried to refuse a scheduled visit from Ms. O'Brien and a home attendant. They came up anyway. Ms. Funke treated them with open disdain. The attendant pointed to a creased throw rug on the floor. ""We talked about this, Phyllis,"" she said. Risk of falls. Ms. Funke saw the apartment through different eyes, as a journal of her travels. ""Each rug means something to me,"" she said. ""Each has a story attached to it."" Maybe this wasn't prison, but for Ms. Funke, it was four walls and no easy way out. Was there money left in her investment accounts? Even the court didn't know. Only the guardian had access to her records. Ms. Funke said Mr. Barbuti often failed to give her the $150 a week allotted by the court, and that he was late paying bills for her parking garage, car insurance, her phone and internet, and that her supplemental health insurance was expired. In court Mr. Barbuti told the judge that he could not pay some of her bills because she refused to provide them to him. Some days it seemed like she spent more time fighting with Mr. Barbuti over her bills than it would take to manage them, and they were still a royal mess, she said. Mr. Barbuti said people had the wrong idea about guardians, that their powers were limited to what the judge gave them. New York also limited runaway fees: if a guardian billed more than $75,000 in a year, he or she could not take any new cases the following year. ""There's a misconception about guardianship, that somehow or other you become that person's alter ego,"" Mr. Barbuti said. ""That's just not the case. All you can do is what the court tells you you can do."" He added: ""I like this kind of work. I feel there's a chance to help somebody and make a difference in their lives."" If you were Ms. Funke, shouldn't you be allowed to withdraw into the covers if you wanted to? And the clutter in your apartment — couldn't people understand that a writer needs materials around? Even if she were evicted, she had money to start somewhere else. Courts evict people with lots less. If you were Judge Kelly, what would you do? Would you want to be the judge who left her vulnerable and unprotected? Mr. Barbuti said the question of guardianship was a complex one. ""People should have the right to make their own decisions, even if you might look at it and I might look at it or a judge might look at it and say that's not a good decision,"" he said. ""I don't think the government should be making decisions like that for people. I think people should be able to make bad decisions. Within bounds."" What these bounds were, he could not say. Ms. Funke said she just wanted to get on with her life. As she approached 80, she worried that she might spend the rest of her years fighting to get out of guardianship. So she fought harder. She remained on probation at her building. By early December she was still writing her Order to Show Cause. It began, ""I'm petitioning, very simply, for the return of my life. The chance to hope again, to dream again. And live the years that remain in a fulfilling and fulfilled manner. Too much has already been destroyed — much improperly; possibly illegally. And primarily — -carelessly, selfishly and pointlessly."" Fifteen pages later, it still had a long way to go. She was working on it, she said."

AMERICA, COMPROMISED By Lawrence Lessig 251 pp. The University of Chicago Press. $24. Among President Trump's major accomplishments is the booming industry in books about him, his administration, the state of democracy in America, the rise of autocracy in America and abroad, the reasons for his rise, the bases of his support, the state of the Republican Party, the state of his mental health or lack thereof, the chaos in his White House and so on. Not all are strictly about Trump — the fact is the conditions and dynamics that brought us Trump long preceded him, and the changes in the fabric of our Republic are paralleled by changes in other longstanding democracies around the globe. Two of the nation's top public intellectuals are adding to this expansive genre with short books designed for broad audiences. Neither is fundamentally about Trump; indeed, one barely mentions the president. But both are about the America that Trump's ascent now typifies. Alan Wolfe, a distinguished professor emeritus at Boston College and prolific scholar of American political thought, gives us ""The Politics of Petulance: America in an Age of Immaturity."" ""America, Compromised"" is by Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, the former head of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics and an activist on campaign finance. Wolfe's is two books in one: first, a polemic, aimed at Trump and his supporters, and at the broader fabric of our age; second, a brief intellectual history of modern America. He sets his frame early on: ""It is … not an explanation of one rogue election we need. It is a discussion of what kind of nation we have become."" To get there, Wolfe focuses intensely on the so-called McCarthy era, the period in the 1950s when Senator Joseph McCarthy used deception, lies and demagogy to create an atmosphere of fear and division. Wolfe draws some parallels with today's Trump era (beyond those of fear, division and deception, there is a direct link: McCarthy's henchman Roy Cohn became Trump's Svengali). But his book is less about McCarthy or his tactics and more about the views of a swath of political thinkers and public intellectuals who arose in that era to take on the ideas that made McCarthyism a threat to our democracy. Wolfe describes and examines a host of postwar political thinkers, many of whom, like Hannah Arendt and Joseph Schumpeter, had come from the horrors of Europe, but he focuses even more on a core group of American-born intellectuals like Richard Hofstadter, Daniel Bell, Lionel Trilling, Nathan Glazer, Irving Kristol, Seymour Martin Lipset and Reinhold Niebuhr, those he calls ""mature liberals."" They set out the values and behaviors that embody what Wolfe views as political maturity, taking on both the world-government left and the populist, demagogic right. Wolfe is at his best when he is discussing these writers, first-class thinkers who responded powerfully to their era's challenges. He contrasts their response to what he sees as the lamer reaction of the contemporary intellectual community to Trump — and suggests we no longer have a core of all-star intellectuals but instead a shallower group of ""thought leaders."" And he tries to draw lessons from the writing of the old school of mature liberals to apply to the present day, a time, he says, when our political immaturity has led to the politics of petulance. The intellectuals Wolfe admires made a case for the appreciation of subtlety, ambiguity, intellectual curiosity and tolerance of divergent views — all qualities that are abundant in the world of thought but have never been cherished by the broader electorate. As he points out, James Bryce wrote 130 years ago, ""The ordinary American voter does not object to mediocrity."" Wolfe notes, of course, that McCarthyism lost, which he attributes in large part to the eloquent and sustained pushback from these public intellectuals (although he stresses that it had taken the horrors of a depression and a huge war to remind liberals of their calling and responsibility). He lays out the conditions that led to our current crisis, but implies that these days we have neither the impetus from horrific conditions nor the intellectual heft to transcend Trump and Trumpism and to move beyond our current ""immature democracy."" Certainly, there are reasons this era is different, but blaming a lack of intellectual heft both overemphasizes the importance of intellectuals and largely dismisses a pretty impressive collection of present-day thinkers, including many of the Never-Trumpers calling for a reassertion of conservative values from the right, and scholars of political thought, race and authoritarianism showing courage and fortitude from the center and left. He also does not give enough emphasis to other conditions: the rise of partisanship extending even to the courts, the importance of tribal media in a new communications age, the obliteration of campaign finance rules that had put some limits on the power of the oligarchic class. Focused as he is on ideas, Wolfe does not end with a series of reforms to reverse our decline. Instead, he offers advice to his readers: Don't be petulant, appreciate the nobility of politics, trust experts, avoid conspiracy theorizing, don't believe candidates who promise only good news, pay attention to political debates, be sensitive to norms and not just laws. All good ideas, but Wolfe has no road map or magic wand to get most Americans to buy into them. ""America, Compromised"" is about the country in the Trump era, but not about Trump. Indeed, Lessig would have written much the same book if Hillary Clinton were president and if Democrats had control of both houses of Congress. His focus is not on bad people doing bad things, but on how incentives across a range of institutions have created corruption, with deleterious consequences for the nation. Anyone who has seen Lessig's mesmerizing TED Talk about Congress and political money knows the basis for this book, now extended to discuss a wider range of institutions, including finance, the media, the medical profession, the academy and the law. All of them, he says, have become corrupted by norms and misplaced incentives that in turn corrupt the behavior of actors who are themselves operating not out of venality but are caught in institutional webs. The rest of us? We inflict the greatest harm on society because we enable them. For Congress, Lessig notes that the framers were deeply concerned about corruption, but rarely focused on the evils of individual quid pro quos. They worried about institutions, the danger of politicians becoming dependent on forces beyond the voters who elected them — or, as Madison wrote, ""the people alone."" Congress, Lessig believes, is corrupt even though the overwhelming majority of congresspeople are not. The institutional corruption here comes from political money. It corrupts the agenda, the issues that get the focus and attention, and moves Congress away from the needs and concerns of the voters. While our political institutions were not all or mainly linked to voters, at least not directly, the House of Representatives is and was meant to be a channel for the voices of the people. It has become something else entirely. Similarly, Lessig's chapter on the media, in which he examines technology meeting market forces, reinforces the sense of dysfunction that flows from distorted incentives. One need only look at Facebook for a current example. With regard to finance, Lessig examines in different ways the 2008 collapse, from banks to ratings agencies that gave AAA ratings to entities that were absurdly dangerous. These agencies were created in the 19th century, and have had impeccable reputations because of their perceived independence and objectivity. But, Lessig says, the big three ratings agencies, designated as official by the Securities and Exchange Commission, compete to get the lucrative business of analyzing securities. Good ratings mean more business. Bad ratings, not so much. With financial institutions playing one agency off against the others, the results were predictable. Lessig quotes Roger Lowenstein, the author of a book on Wall Street: ""Imagine the big rating agencies as three competitive saloons standing side by side, with each free to set its own drinking age. Before long, 9-year-olds would be downing bourbon."" The ratings failures were key contributors to the financial collapse. Individuals in the agencies did not take bribes — it was the perverse incentives that corrupted the institutions. In his essay on the academy, Lessig first writes scathingly of the psychiatric profession. In the era of miracle medications promising relief or cures, psychiatry has become captive to the pharmaceutical industry, altering the ways diseases have been classified and drugs prescribed. Other parts of the academic world have been corrupted as well, Lessig writes, with experts as hired guns who are now paid to testify. What's more, legislation sponsored by the Democrat Birch Bayh and the Republican Bob Dole and passed in 1980 was intended to encourage academics to bring their research to the marketplace. But giving financial incentives to the academics for their work meant both more commercialism at public expense and more reasons for scientists to keep their findings secret, hindering the free exchange of research findings. Some of Lessig's toughest words are for his own profession, the law. Lawyers used to prosecute white-collar crime, without partisanship or other biases. But somehow, in the aftermath of the catastrophic financial crisis in 2008, not a single individual miscreant was brought to the bar of justice. Why? Start with the fact that the gap between the incomes of prosecutors and lawyers in firms has ballooned; a prosecutor now struggles for a good life relative to his or her law school colleagues in the private sector. That has led to a revolving door between prosecutors' offices and white-collar defense firms. Being ""hirable"" means public officials can't be too hard on firms they might eventually join. It is not a matter of greed, but of distorted incentives leading to unsettling behavior. What to do? Lessig examines a range of ways to de-corrupt institutions. As with so many efforts, it is hard to find remedies that are realistic and practical. Still, some of Lessig's ideas are not just pie in the sky. He recommends public financing for campaigns; delinking rating agencies and experts offering testimony from those paying for it; and using in-depth polls to gauge public opinion on key issues as a kind of shadow government. That two impressive public intellectuals like Alan Wolfe and Lawrence Lessig are weighing in on the challenges of our times, joining so many others, is reassuring. ""The Politics of Petulance"" and ""America, Compromised"" join an impressive array of books and essays that may, someday, have a future intellectual historian using them as examples to lament the fact that his or her contemporaries are not as eloquent or important as the group that arose in the Trump era to combat the threats to our way of life."
News,2018-12-07,"LOS ANGELES — They are the forgotten people of Los Angeles — 1,457 people, to be exact. Old, poor, homeless, babies born premature and abandoned.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/us/los-angeles-dead-homeless.html,905," LOS ANGELES — They are the forgotten people of Los Angeles — 1,457 people, to be exact. Old, poor, homeless, babies born premature and abandoned. They may have died alone, but they were buried together, in a mass grave, and were honored together this week in an interfaith ceremony that has been an annual ritual in Los Angeles for more than a century. On a chilly Wednesday morning, on a green hillside in Boyle Heights and just as the country was paying tribute to a former president, George Bush, Los Angeles County honored what it calls its ""unclaimed dead."" ""I think it is appropriate that on the same day that we mourn the loss of a commander in chief, we also mourn the loss of individuals whose deaths did not receive national attention, or much attention at all, but whose lives were no less worthy of our recognition,"" Janice Hahn, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said at the service. The county does not have to do this, but the tradition, which dates back to 1896, has become a sacred event for the many county workers — coroners, researchers — whose job it is to investigate how people die in Los Angeles. Their work is a long process of figuring out who these people were, and if there are loved ones looking for them. Nearly all of the forgotten Angelenos honored this year died in 2015, and in most cases a relative was found but for whatever reason — financial hardship, estrangement — they did not want to claim the remains. The county keeps a list online of each person's name, date of birth, date of death, and the date of cremation. All were cremated, and some lived long lives: Maria Bulgier was 103 when she died; Grace Wetzel, 92. Others have no names. Baby Boy Manor is listed as being born and having died on the same day: Oct. 6, 2015. The county keeps remains for three years, and if no one claims them they are buried in the mass grave, and honored with a ceremony on the first Wednesday of December. ""Some of these individuals were homeless, many were poor, some were newborn babies, and tragically many of them have no loved ones to grieve for them,"" Ms. Hahn said. She continued, ""At one point, these people had parents. At one point these people had friends. At one point, these people laughed and loved and cried like the rest of us."" For a big, sprawling region like Los Angeles County, the ceremony is also an annual exercise in community — many members of the public return, year after year — in a place that can often feel isolating. Some 200 people attended this year. Stefan Timmermans, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who researches how people die and how communities grieve, began attending several years ago as part of his work. He has spent time with workers at the medical examiner's office, diving into files and going on ride-alongs with coroners. But he has kept attending the ceremony because he found it personally meaningful. ""I just find it also very moving and very touching that people come together around this, and there's something very powerful about stepping up to the plate, taking time from L.A. traffic and your everyday life,"" he said. ""It contrasts very strongly with the abandonment of these people."" He said the ceremony was ""sort of like an antidote to the isolation and alienation you can have in big cities, which is reflected in the many unclaimed, about 1,500 in L.A. County every year."" Phillip Gruber, who works in health services for the county, said he had been meaning to come for many years, and finally did this year, ""to see how our society finds a way to honor people who have been apart."" ""Our highest ideal is to treat each other with dignity and respect no matter who you are,"" he said. Reflecting the diversity of Los Angeles, there were representatives of many spiritual traditions at the ceremony: Christian, Jewish, Native American, Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist. A man with an oboe played Bach, and a choir sang ""Amazing Grace."" Those gathered placed flowers on the grave site, on a plot of land that has long been a final resting place for the forgotten of Los Angeles: More than a decade ago, the century-old remains of Chinese laborers were discovered nearby as workers were digging a tunnel for the extension of the city's subway. Walking back to the parking lot after the ceremony, Mary Bonderove, who came from Whittier to attend for the first time, had tears in her eyes. ""Every life matters,"" she said. Her friend Elena DeGarmo, a retired accountant, has been coming for several years. ""Every life deserves someone to witness the end of it and be a witness that they were here,"" she said. ""In L.A., between homelessness and poverty, people just get tossed away."" In a column published this week in The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Timmermans and his research partner, Pamela Prickett, a professor at the University of Amsterdam, wrote of the anonymous lives of the city's forgotten. ""Their stories won't be told: family strife, alienation, perhaps addiction, poverty or violence in a big city,"" he wrote. The column continued, ""These aren't happy Hollywood endings,"" he continued. ""But at least when these people die, Los Angeles doesn't abandon them."""
News,2018-12-07,"It would have been so easy for the creators of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” to get it all wrong. We’ve all seen New York through the eyes of the Hollywood dream machine in a way that could not fool us, the native New Yorkers.

",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/arts/television/mrs-maisel-photos-new-york-locations.html,1425," It would have been so easy for the creators of ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" to get it all wrong. We've all seen New York through the eyes of the Hollywood dream machine in a way that could not fool us, the native New Yorkers. We've scowled at streets that were supposed to be Harlem but were clearly a backlot in Burbank, Calif. We've shook our heads at shimmering skyscrapers that were meant to be the financial district but were obviously Toronto or Vancouver. And perhaps the worst: We've watched characters who are not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe hop on a subway in TriBeCa and arrive, moments later, in Washington Heights.  Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, Daniel Palladino, the show's creators, are both California natives, but they know and love New York. ""We grew up separately in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles and have spent most of our lives there,"" said Mr. Palladino, ""but always had this fascination with New York and just really needed a good excuse to be out here permanently. Which we are now — we live in Brooklyn.""  Ms. Sherman-Palladino explained, ""The big thing about a show like ours is, any network or studio is going to want to not do it in New York, because it's expensive. We had a long talk with Amazon about the fact that this show cannot become a show that becomes people talking in rooms, because it's not that show. It needs breath and air, and it needs to live out on the streets."" The streets of New York come to life in both Seasons 1 and 2 of ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel."" Even those of us who weren't born during the era the show portrays watched with delight as the show depicted places and spaces of New York lore — the Gaslight Cafe nightclub, Kettle of Fish bar and the Carnegie Deli among them. As the second season debuted on Dec. 5, we asked the creators to look at photos from our archives and to share their thoughts about the New York as shot by Times photographers and the New York of their show.  DANIEL PALLADINO Right off the bat, a big thing for us and our production designer is that back then signage was much more prevalent. In the photo of Eighth Street [above], I'm struck by signage that you see here on both sides of the streets. Back then, if you went to a grocery store, the windows would just be covered from head to toe with signage: advertising goose livers, prices, ""Come on in!"" — all that stuff, at all different kinds of angles. Much more than we do today. So we're constantly slapping signage up.  AMY SHERMAN-PALLADINO All this stuff is like the layering of the signs, and the signs within the signs. We had a lot of talk about layers, and a lot of talk about the signage. Because the period was that period of like, ""We're on the upswing, and the last decade was sad, and we conquered the world. We're America."" So that feeling was pulsating through the city.  PALLADINO There'd be a sign over a sign, and then a sign sticking out, and a sign up here and a sign up there. SHERMAN-PALLADINO I want to live somewhere with a big neon ""babka,"" that sounds like heaven to me.""  PALLADINO This looks like an uptown crowd came downtown a little bit. It's a pretty white crowd. It looks like they came from work. And they would do that, we had in our pilot, we had Midge and Joel's friends, the Clearys came down, it was very exotic for them to go downtown. There were people who, as you know, to this day, if you live uptown, sometimes they never go downtown. And if you live downtown, they never go uptown, unless it's for theater or something.  SHERMAN-PALLADINO The other thing is, if you look at a lot of these Village pictures, the men didn't wear hats in the Village, they wore hats uptown. So if you look at a lot of these Village pictures, they are in black and white, but these guys could be wearing this today. It's a little bit less of the Doris Day feeling, because people look much more modern in these pictures.  PALLADINO It was Kennedy not wearing a hat to his inauguration that made men think, ""Maybe I shouldn't wear a hat."" It's kind of a shame. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Hats are great. PALLADINO This looks like Italy a little bit with the motorbike and Borgia. But you also notice the other thing is there are more trees now. There weren't nearly as many trees, they were just planting them. SHERMAN-PALLADINO So the trees were like sticks. That's another thing that we have to deal with downtown, you have these blocks where there's tree, tree, tree, and it feels like the Upper West Side, because there just weren't trees there. They didn't have that in the Village. SHERMAN-PALLADINO There is a lot of unchanged in New York, but it's surrounded by a lot of change. We'll go and we'll shoot something, and then our special effects will come in and do all the cleanup. And the cleanup is crazy, from locks to the cages on the air-conditioners, not the air-conditioners themselves, but the cages, security cameras. PALLADINO Satellite dishes, A.T.M.'s. Everything is everywhere, and we erase so much stuff. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Oh my god. Look at this. PALLADINO This is something we should keep in mind, maybe. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Four women, one room, that's a nightmare. That's so great. ""Singles Week."" Of course. PALLADINO ""Singles Week,"" what does that mean? Was it before or after the normal season? SHERMAN-PALLADINO It's August. PALLADINO That's right in the thick of the season, the whole week of just singles?  SHERMAN-PALLADINO Not by the end of the week. SHERMAN-PALLADINO This is a great picture. PALLADINO I would say it's [the actor] George Hamilton doing the frug or something in 1964. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Look at that! And this would not be the only show that night, right? That's the amazing thing. PALLADINO This is thousands of people. We do an episode where we're saying she's at the Concord, but there was no way we could recreate a theater this wide with this many people … We want to make it look like the modern world, but the modern world for them was 1959, 1960. So that's what Amy was saying, that a lot of times when you see movies especially, but a lot of television shows that are set in the '20s or in the '40s or the '50s. SHERMAN-PALLADINO They'll do it in the '70s, like everything in the '70s was orange. PALLADINO They'll add a color of patina to the cinematography that is supposed to make it look like 1970 or 1960 to our eyes, but again, back then the world wasn't orange. It was bright and colorful. So I think the vintage aspect comes into effect in the costume, in the wardrobe and the production design.  SHERMAN-PALLADINO And New York is 1700s, 1800s, early 1900s, it's everything layered upon, layered upon, layered upon. When you look at the Maisel apartment, it's not just all 1950s — there're pieces that would have been in Rose's family from the 1800s and mixed up, because everyone's apartment is a mixture of what your life has been up until then, not just a snapshot in time in that moment. Nobody goes out and furnishes an entire apartment in one day, and then that's how they live. SHERMAN-PALLADINO We wanted to make sure that when we photographed New York, it didn't have any sort of filter or sepia tone feel that made it feel quaint or old-fashioned or old-timey. Because you see the people in these pictures, they're walking quickly, there's an energy, there's a vibrancy, even just to the pictures of New York. Especially during that time, because it was postwar and things were on the upswing, and there was so much innovation. It was, ""Buy a washing machine, buy a car, buy this and buy that.""  PALLADINO We always make a point to everybody that these people, they're our past, but they thought they were living in a modern world. And they were living in a modern world. So one of the things we tell our extras who come in — we have to tell some of our guest actors this — but we tell our extras, too, ""Don't walk down the street in the scene like you're in 1959, just walk down the street."" Because they didn't know they were in 1959. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Don't try to be old-timey. This interview has been condensed and edited for length and clarity."
briefing,2018-12-07,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/briefing/huawei-angela-merkel-kevin-hart.html,1394," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with the fallout from the arrest of a Chinese executive, proposed rollbacks of environmental regulations and  the latest from the midterm elections. We also invite you to share your thoughts about our new design. The arrest over the weekend of a top executive at Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, has complicated President Trump's trade talks with Beijing and drawn sharp protests from the Chinese government.  Meng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, was arrested in Canada at Washington's request, which is seen as a warning shot against the growing influence of Chinese technology. The Justice Department is investigating the company on charges of violating sanctions on Iran. Reaction: ""To detain someone without giving clear reason is an obvious violation of human rights,"" said a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, demanding Ms. Meng's release.  Side effects: The news contributed to whiplash for global markets on Thursday, but things seem more stable today. Background: The U.S. has considered Huawei a security threat for years, and other countries are expressing increased concern, too.  The administration outlined plans on Thursday to open nine million acres in the American West to drilling and mining by removing protections for the sage grouse, an imperiled ground-nesting bird. Reaction: The proposal, which is expected to be finalized next year, drew immediate criticism from environmentalists and praise from energy-industry representatives. Background: The plan is part of an effort to promote more oil and gas drilling on public land in support of what Mr. Trump calls a policy of American ""energy dominance."" Related: The administration is also expected to submit a proposal next week that would significantly weaken a major Obama-era regulation to protect the sources of drinking water for about a third of the country.  Republicans conceded a seventh congressional seat in California on Thursday, meaning that Democrats are likely to take 40 House seats from Republicans in the new Congress.  David Valadao, who has represented Central California since 2013, had initially been declared the winner, but his Democratic opponent, T.J. Cox, pulled ahead when mail-in votes were counted. In North Carolina: The congressional campaign of the Republican Mark Harris disclosed that it owed more than $34,000 to a company whose work on absentee ballots and voter turnout has prompted fears of election fraud and called his narrow victory into question. In Michigan: Republicans, following the example of lawmakers in Wisconsin, moved to limit the powers of the incoming Democratic secretary of state. They also prepared to curb the authority of Democrats who will take over as governor and attorney general in January. Victorina Morales, a housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., is also an undocumented immigrant. Sandra Diaz, who is now a legal resident of the U.S., said she, too, was undocumented when she worked at the club from 2010 to 2013. The two women said they were not the only workers at Bedminster who were in the country illegally, although there is no evidence that Mr. Trump or Trump Organization executives knew of the women's immigration status. Notable: Mr. Trump has made border security and the fight to protect jobs for Americans a cornerstone of his presidency. Response: The Trump Organization, which owns the golf course, said in a statement: ""If an employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately."" The White House declined to comment. How we know: Ms. Morales and Ms. Diaz approached The Times through their lawyer, who is representing them on immigration matters. As part of its verification of this article, The Times reviewed Ms. Morales's pay stubs and W-2 forms, which list the golf course as her employer. Mrs. Obama, pictured above as a college student at Princeton, is the descendant of the very caste of people that some of her predecessors in the White House owned.  Her new memoir is ""a serious work of candid reflection by a singular figure of early-21st-century America,"" according to Isabel Wilkerson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Times journalist and the author of ""The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration.""  Monthly jobs report: The U.S. economy added 155,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department reported today. The unemployment rate was unchanged from the month before, at 3.7 percent.  Final farewell for George Bush: After a funeral service for the former president in Houston on Thursday, his body was carried 70 miles by train to his presidential library in College Station, Tex., where he was laid to rest. German politics: After 18 years under the leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Christian Democratic Union party is set to elect a new leader today. Here's a look at the leading candidates to replace her. Featured videos: Standout actors including Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke turn common experiences into enchanting moments of dance for The Times Magazine's annual Great Performers issue. Kevin Hart controversy: Days after the comedian was named the host of next year's Academy Awards, he drew criticism for his past use of homophobic slurs on Twitter. Early this morning he withdrew from the role. Grammy nominations: The rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake led the list of nominees announced today. The four major categories — record of the year, song of the year, album of the year and best new artist — are dominated by women. News quiz: Did you follow the headlines this week? Test yourself. Late-night comedy: Filling in for an ailing Trevor Noah, Desi Lydic noted that President Trump has employed undocumented immigrants: ""Trump told us he'd build a wall, but he never said there'd be a service entrance."" What we're reading: Anne-Sophie Bolon, an editor in London, recommends this piece from Longreads: ""The series 'Ugly History of Beautiful Things' turns to Angora rabbit wool, prized for its beauty, silky touch and warmth. The fiber was particularly popular in the 1930s and '40s with Hollywood stars, but also, it turns out, with Nazi officers."" Cook: A comforting dish of polenta topped with fried eggs. Listen to: Our critics' picks of the best pop music of the year. There are 65 songs to enjoy. Go to: The best performance of Handel's ""Messiah"" in New York City. (Hint: It's not at Lincoln Center.) Watch: Some great TV this weekend, including RuPaul's holiday special and a costume drama.

There have been many suggestions: the former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, the mathematician Alan Turing and the physicist Stephen Hawking. One lesser-known name caught our attention: Noor Inayat Khan, who spied for Britain during World War II. Ms. Khan wasn't what one would expect of a British spy. She was born a princess to Indian royalty, and she was a musician and a writer. But she spoke French and had excellent radio skills. She became the first female radio operator sent by Britain into occupied France. She did the work of six radio operators, moving constantly and dyeing her hair blond to avoid detection. Her work became crucial to the war effort. Ms. Khan never made it home; she was captured and executed at the Dachau concentration camp in 1944. She was 30. Read more about her here.

News,2018-12-07,Good Friday. Want this by email? Sign up here.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/business/dealbook/tech-ipo-uber-lyft.html,2009," Good Friday. Want this by email? Sign up here. Some of America's biggest privately held start-ups have resisted going public for years. That's about to change, and perhaps faster than we had thought it would. The news: Lyft, most recently valued at $15 billion, announced that it had confidentially filed a draft registration statement with the S.E.C. for an I.P.O. The ride-hailing company had indicated that it planned to go public in the middle of next year, but it is moving up the timing. Lyft's competitor Uber, which could be worth as much as $120 billion, is also moving its I.P.O. up from fall 2019. Why are they going public? ""For years, many unicorns were in no rush to go public because they could grow easily with money from private investors and away from the scrutiny of Wall Street,"" the NYT's Erin Griffith and Mike Isaac write. ""Those attitudes have shifted as investors and tech employees have increased pressure on the companies to go public so that they can cash in their shares."" Why the urgency now? Uber is said to be nervous about a looming recession. Lyft apparently pulled things forward because of the recent stock market sell-off (and because it wants to beat Uber to the punch). ""Few executives want to take their companies public when investors' appetite for shares may be ebbing,"" Ms. Griffith and Mr. Isaac write. Plus: Airbnb and Slack are also expected to go public next year, too, although the timing is unclear. On Saturday, Canadian police, acting at the request of the United States, detained Meng Wanzhou, the C.F.O. of the Chinese technology giant Huawei. The arrest came as President Trump was negotiating a trade truce with President Xi Jinping of China. More on why the arrest happened and what it means for the fragile trade truce between the U.S. and China from Mark Landler, Edward Wong and Katie Benner of the NYT: • ""The Justice Department is investigating Ms. Meng's company, Huawei, on charges of violating sanctions on Iran, and her arrest was meant as a warning shot by the Trump administration in its campaign to limit the global spread of Chinese technology."" • ""While the Justice Department did brief the White House about the impending arrest, Mr. Trump was not told about it. And the subject did not come up at the dinner with Mr. Xi."" • ""Former American officials said the awkward timing of it was most likely a coincidence that grew out of the unpredictable travel schedule of Ms. Meng."" • But ""the timing of the arrest, some experts said, could feed the suspicion of Chinese officials that nationalist factions in the Trump administration were trying to sabotage the trade deal."" President Trump got some good news yesterday: The U.S. exported more oil and fuel than it imported last week. That was the first time that had happened in 75 years. But that may have been outweighed by the monthly U.S. trade deficit hitting $55.5 billion in October, the highest monthly level in 10 years. Mr. Trump had pinned his hopes on oil and gas. Domestic production has been increasing, and the federal government lifted a ban in 2015 on crude oil exports, allowing American oil to flow outside its borders. That was supposed to help narrow the trade deficit. But the gap has continued to grow. ""The basic explanation is that the United States' appetite for foreign investment, including the financing of the federal debt, is driving the country's consumption of imports,"" write Binyamin Appelbaum and Jim Tankersley of the NYT. ""The dollars that the United States borrows from foreign countries are the dollars that the United States spends on foreign products."" The chairman of the failing retailer, which also owns Kmart, has offered to buy its remaining assets for $4.6 billion in a bid to prevent it from collapse. Here's how it would work. Mr. Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments, says it has put together the money from a mixture of cash, new loans and debt swaps. It would take over the entire company, including stores and brands like Kenmore. It would seek to keep the 500 or so stores that are still open and to preserve around 50,000 jobs. The deal would need to fend off bids that liquidators have prepared. So far, reactions have been negative. Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail advisory firm, told Bloomberg that Mr. Lambert was ""trying to perpetuate himself almost as an undertaker to drain more blood out of the body and make more money as he's doing it."" Farla Efros, the president of HRC Retail Advisory, said that the deal was ""really about ego and saving face."" OPEC ended a meeting yesterday without striking a deal to reduce oil output, writes Stanley Reed of the NYT. Officials discussed a range of cuts, with a reduction of a million barrels per day — or around 1 percent of global oil supply, a modest amount in the eyes of traders — thought to be enough to stabilize prices. The indecision reflects the different pressures facing the oil industry: • On one hand, the world is widely viewed as having an oil glut substantial enough to justify a cut in production, a move that would prop up prices. • But President Trump is pressing OPEC, and Saudi Arabia in particular, to maintain production levels to keep prices down for American consumers. Oil prices tumbled amid the failure to strike a deal. Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropped about 3.5 percent, to $59.40. There was little sign that things would improve when officials reconvene today. Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, told reporters he was ""not confident"" that an agreement that would keep supply and demand in balance was within reach. More natural resources news: The Trump administration plans to open nine million acres to drilling and mining by removing protections for the sage grouse, an imperiled ground-nesting bird. A steep slide followed by a strong recovery whipsawed investors on Thursday, write Alexandra Stevenson and Matt Phillips of the NYT. Here's what happened. A high-profile arrest raised trade worries. The arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the C.F.O. of Huawei, led investors to fear that the U.S.-China trade war could escalate rather than calm. The S&P 500 fell as much as 2.9 percent on the news, but regained much of the lost ground by day's end. Positive news about the Fed calmed investor jitters. The Wall Street Journal published an article saying that the central bank was considering emphasizing a wait-and-see approach to rate increases, offering traders some reassurance about future monetary policy. But one sector didn't bounce back. Energy shares were the worst-performing part of the S&P 500 yesterday, after prices for American crude oil fell when OPEC's meeting failed to yield a deal to reduce oil output. The relentless volatility is getting harder to explain. ""Markets have grown so jittery that moves seem detached from the fundamental or technical analysis that traders use to underpin investment decisions,"" write Vildana Hajric and Sarah Ponczek of Bloomberg. What if President Trump is correct and the Fed's interest rate increases are holding back the U.S. economy? It might depend on the starting point. Barry B. Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel, tells Peter Eavis of DealBook that the Fed's main policy rate, the federal funds rate, was in effect significantly lower in the years after the 2008 financial crisis than the actual rate. Call it the shadow rate. ""The economists Jing Cynthia Wu and Fan Dora Xia used the yields on government bonds to calculate a shadow fed funds rate. Their intent was to estimate what that rate would have been if it could have fallen below zero,"" Mr. Eavis writes. ""In the years after the crisis, this shadow rate fell as low as minus 3 percent in May 2014."" Why that matters now. ""The Fed has taken the fed funds rate from zero in 2015 to 2.25 percent today. But using the shadow rate, the Fed has effectively taken that rate from minus 3 percent in mid-2014 up to 2.25 percent today, a much greater increase, and one that might now be pressuring the economy."" A note of caution: From a growing G.D.P. to healthy loan issuance, there are still plenty of reasons to question whether monetary policy is really too stringent. Hannah Karp, a former reporter at The Wall Street Journal, has been appointed as the new editorial director at Billboard magazine. James Quincey, Coca-Cola's chief executive, will now also serve as its chairman. Tesla's general counsel, Todd Maron, is leaving the company. He will be succeeded by Dane Butswinkas, a Washington trial lawyer. Unilever's chief marketing officer, Keith Weed, will retire in May.

News,2018-12-07,"Shari Horne broke her toes a decade ago, and after surgery, “I have plates and pins and screws in my feet, and they get achy at times,” she said. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/health/seniors-marijuana-cannabis-pain.html,1147," Shari Horne broke her toes a decade ago, and after surgery, ""I have plates and pins and screws in my feet, and they get achy at times,"" she said.  So Ms. Horne, 66, applies a salve containing cannabidiol, derived from the cannabis, or marijuana, plant. It eases the pain.  The salve didn't help when she developed bursitis in her shoulder, but a tincture of cannabidiol mixed with T.H.C., the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, provided relief.  Using a pipe, she also smokes ""a few hits"" of a cannabis brand called Blue Dream after dinner, because ""I think relaxing is healthy for you."" Many of her neighbors in Laguna Woods, Calif., a community of mostly older adults in Orange County, where she serves on the City Council, have developed similar routines. ""People in their 80s and 90s, even retired Air Force colonels, are finding such relief"" with cannabis, said Ms. Horne. ""Almost everybody I know is using it in one form or another"" — including her husband Hal, 68, a retired insurance broker, who says it helps him sleep. In fact, so many Laguna Woods seniors use medical cannabis — for ailments ranging from arthritis and diabetes nerve pain to back injuries and insomnia — that the local dispensary, Bud and Bloom, charters a free bus to bring residents to its Santa Ana location to stock up on supplies. Along with a catered lunch, the bus riders get a seniors discount. Physicians who treat older adults expect their cannabis use to increase as the number of states legalizing medical marijuana keeps growing. After the midterm elections, when Utah and Missouri voters approved medical use, 33 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana, along with ten states that also have legalized recreational use.  Though the federal government still outlaws cannabis, classified as a Schedule I drug along with heroin (meaning that it has no therapeutic value), public support has swung sharply in favor of legalization, polls have found.  That support may rise as the baby boomers, often no strangers to marijuana, succeed their more leery parents as the oldest cohort. People aged 50 to 64 are more likely to report recent marijuana use than their elders. ""You might not like it,"" Dr. David Casarett, chief of palliative care at Duke University Medical Center, tells fellow physicians. ""You might not believe in it. But your patients are using this stuff."" He and Dr. Joshua Briscoe, a psychiatrist at Duke also trained in palliative care, have mixed feelings about that. Co-authors of a recent article on medical marijuana and older adults in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, they support legalization for medical use. They hope the federal government will reclassify cannabis (""a huge undertaking,"" Dr. Briscoe admitted), reducing obstacles to much-needed research. ""We're always searching for a better medication that can treat pain and a host of other symptoms without burdensome side effects, and cannabis is promising"" as a treatment for a number of conditions, Dr. Briscoe said. Their overview — along with a major report last year from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — points out disorders for which cannabis does appear to have therapeutic effects. But the researchers are uneasy about the fact that older people essentially are undertaking self-treatment, with scant guidance from medical professionals. Cannabis consumers face a confusing array of options, including various strains and brands and many methods of ingestion: smoking, vaping, tinctures, edibles, topical creams or patches. Users can also experience potentially harmful side effects. When Joy Kavianian, 55, a Laguna Woods resident with Parkinson's disease, wanted to reduce her right-side tremors so that she could continue making ceramics, a cherished pursuit, she had lots of questions about cannabis. ""I didn't know how this would mix with my other meds,"" she said. ""How would it affect my sleep? The only answer was to slowly introduce it and see."" She has learned that a tincture, placed under her tongue about 40 minutes before she heads to the art studio, gives her four hours in which to work effectively. But that discovery took weeks of trial and error. ""The social support and legislation is outpacing the research,"" Dr. Briscoe said. ""If I want to say, 'Take this dose for this condition and that dose for that one' — the evidence just isn't there."" For older people, what does the still-limited evidence show? The strongest case, Dr. Casarett said, is that cannabis can reduce neuropathic pain, sometimes caused by diabetes, shingles or chemotherapy, without the toxic effects of opioids. Studies have also shown that cannabis alleviates the nausea and vomiting that often follows chemotherapy. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration has approved two synthetic T.H.C. drugs for that purpose, though some patients insist that smoking the real thing works better. Cannabis appears to relieve muscle spasms in people with multiple sclerosis, though that research is less extensive, and to improve appetite for patients with cancer or AIDS, Dr. Briscoe said. ""Plenty of patients swear it's the only thing that helps them sleep,"" he added. But while drowsiness often accompanies cannabis use, the evidence that it reliably improves sleep remains modest. Its effects on anxiety and depression are also unclear. And like any drug, cannabis has side effects, some of particular concern for older users, who metabolize medications differently from younger adults. Dizziness, for instance, can lead to injurious falls. Marijuana use is also associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents, so Dr. Casarett and Dr. Briscoe advise counseling older patients not to drive for six to nine hours after use, depending on ingestion method. Moreover, ""the jury is very much out about long-term cognitive effects in adults,"" Dr. Casarett said. But there's no evidence that medical marijuana users are at increased risk of abusing the drug. Y. Tony Yang, a health services and policy researcher at George Washington University, recently predicted in a JAMA Neurology editorial that a June decision by the F.D.A. will have far-reaching consequences. The agency approved Epidiolex, the first C.B.D. prescription drug to be legally sold in the United States, for reducing seizures in rare adolescent forms of epilepsy.  ""A doctor can now prescribe this off-label for other uses, which is legal and common,"" Dr. Yang said. ""And on the research side, this could pave the way for controlled clinical trials for other purposes."" Insurers may balk at covering off-label use, he conceded. Medicare, for instance, doesn't cover medical cannabis, and it won't cover drugs used off-label. The bus riders from Laguna Woods often pay $100 to $200 a month out of pocket for cannabis products, a financial struggle for some. But riders like Catherine McCormick, who's 53, find it a worthwhile expenditure. To lessen pain after knee replacement surgery, she was relying on high doses of ibuprofen, ""too much wine"" and several prescription drugs, including oxycodone, benzodiazepines and an antidepressant.  She weaned herself from them all in a few months, she said, by smoking cannabis. That's made her a believer.  ""I have more energy. I can walk,"" she said. ""I'm not in pain. I feel so much better."""

This week began in Paris, however, with startlingly violent discord over fuel taxes stemming from that climate deal. The protesters, clad in the yellow safety vests France requires motorists to carry, are the most visible and extreme example of a backlash against taxes intended to save the world from a carbon-induced climate disaster. But they are far from unique in their opposition. Under President Trump, the United States has vowed to quit the Paris Agreement, and the country's deteriorating relationship with China has become a potential roadblock to global progress. [Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Sign up here.] In Canada, a meeting this week between the country's premiers and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was preceded by vocal opposition from the leaders of Ontario and Saskatchewan over plans to impose a federal carbon tax in their provinces. And as the world's environment ministers meet this month in Poland for follow-up talks on the Paris climate accord, many of the signatories — Canada included — remain far off-course on the goals of the agreement. As part of my reporting  on the carbon challenges ahead for Mr. Trudeau, I went to Saskatchewan, the epicenter of carbon tax opposition in Canada. During our meeting in Saskatchewan's legislative building, Scott Moe, the premier, repeatedly emphasized that despite his opposition to carbon pricing, the province isn't avoiding climate action. While the federal government and many environmentalists don't think its efforts are sufficient, no one is criticizing steps like replacing coal energy with natural gas, wind and solar power. Saskatchewan will also require companies that spew the most carbon to cut emissions by 5 to 15 percent. Mr. Moe is not a climate change denier. But he is flatly dismissive of the large body of work by economists showing that carbon pricing is an effective tool. ""I don't think it's fair to say, in any way, that it does work,"" he told me. Several of the ranchers and farmers I met, as well as some in southeastern Saskatchewan's energy industry, went further, wondering aloud whether Canada should do anything at all. They argued that any action from a country that accounts for about 1.6 percent of global emissions verges on the symbolic when China produces about 30 percent of the world's carbon dioxide. That case, however, ignores that China has already reached its carbon reduction commitment for 2020, a target many experts believe that Canada won't hit by the deadline. Andrew Scheer, the federal Conservative leader, has become as focused on eliminating carbon pricing as Mr. Trudeau has on introducing it. And while Canada is unlikely to see anything like the ""yellow vest"" violence of France, it's highly likely that the debate over carbon pricing will figure prominently in next year's federal vote.

Op-Ed,2018-12-08,"On Friday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the special counsel, Robert Mueller, delivered a potentially devastating one-two punch against President Trump. Coming late in the day, they made for bracing end-of-the-week reading.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/opinion/trump-collusion-cohen-manafort.html,862," On Friday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the special counsel, Robert Mueller, delivered a potentially devastating one-two punch against President Trump. Coming late in the day, they made for bracing end-of-the-week reading. Calling on the court to impose a sentence of substantial imprisonment against Michael Cohen, the president's former personal attorney, prosecutors in the Southern District of New York stated that Mr. Trump, the Trump Organization and the campaign were all directly involved in an illegal scheme to silence two women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Prosecutors wrote that payments made by Mr. Cohen and other actions were taken ""with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election"" and pursued ""in coordination with and at the direction of Individual 1"" — that is, Mr. Trump. The Trump Organization's reimbursements to Mr. Cohen for payments were fraudulently disguised as legal fees — and, according to the memo, were approved by senior executives at the organization. The New York prosecutors also disclosed that they are investigating additional unspecified matters involving Mr. Cohen and, presumably, the Trump Organization. In light of these disclosures, the likelihood that the company and the Trump campaign face charges is now high.  Although President Trump may avoid a similar fate because the Justice Department is unlikely to indict a sitting president, he could be named as an unindicted co-conspirator, as was President Richard Nixon, or charged if he leaves office before the statute of limitations runs out (most likely in 2022). In crediting Mr. Cohen with providing ""substantial and significant efforts"" to assist the investigation, Mr. Mueller's separate sentencing memo details new evidence of collusion with Russia, including a previously unreported phone conversation in November 2015 between Mr. Cohen and an unnamed Russian who claimed to be a ""trusted person"" in Moscow. The Russian explained to Mr. Cohen how the Russian government could provide the Trump campaign with ""political synergy"" and ""synergy on a government level,"" and offered to set up a meeting between Mr. Trump, then a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.  This newly disclosed conversation directly speaks to the question of collusion — the outreach was explicitly political and was focused on how each side would gain from a potential partnership. Mr. Mueller also notes that Mr. Cohen provided his team with additional information relevant to the ""core"" of the special counsel investigation.  The special counsel focuses on Mr. Cohen's contacts with people connected to the White House in 2017 and 2018, possibly further implicating the president and others in his orbit in conspiracy to obstruct justice or to suborn perjury. Mr. Mueller specifically mentions that Mr. Cohen provided invaluable insight into the ""preparing and circulating"" of his testimony to Congress — and if others, including the president, knew about the false testimony or encouraged it in any way, they would be at substantial legal risk. Mr. Trump's legal woes do not end there. The special counsel also advanced the president's potential exposure under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for activities relating to a potential Trump Tower Moscow. Mr. Mueller noted that the Moscow project was a lucrative business opportunity that actively sought Russian government approval, and that the unnamed Russian told Mr. Cohen that there was ""no bigger warranty in any project than the consent"" of Mr. Putin.  If recent reports that Mr. Cohen floated the idea of giving Mr. Putin a $50 million luxury apartment in a future Trump Tower Moscow prove true, both the president and his company could face substantial jeopardy. In a second blow to the president, on Friday prosecutors also disclosed a list of false statements that Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, allegedly made to federal investigators in breach of the cooperation agreement he entered into following his conviction for financial fraud and subsequent guilty plea to criminal conspiracy. Some of the lies that the special counsel spells out in the redacted memorandum appear to implicate the president and those close to him in possible collusion and obstruction crimes. Notably, Mr. Manafort is accused of lying to the special counsel regarding his contacts with the Trump administration.  We don't know the content of those contacts, but considering public statements about potential pardons, it is not hard to imagine they could implicate the president and others in a conspiracy to obstruct justice or witness tampering if, for example, they suggested a potential pardon if Mr. Manafort protected the president.  Contrary to the president's claim that all of this ""totally clears"" him, the danger to Mr. Trump, his business and his campaign has compounded significantly. For all these reasons, the president is unlikely to have a restful, tweet-free weekend — or a calm 2019, for that matter.

At an open mic, it could be a few boxes of pizza.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/neediest-cases/taking-college-one-meal-at-a-time.html,862," At a dorm movie night, he might find sandwiches. At an open mic, it could be a few boxes of pizza. Other Cornell students might see free food at campus events as a bonus. But for Samuel Issiah Williams, it is often dinner. Mr. Williams, 22, is a Cornell senior majoring in information science. He arrived on campus this semester facing rising tuition costs, unexpected health insurance fees and thousands of dollars in loans. Rather than add to his mounting debt, he decided to forgo a meal plan — thousands of dollars for the year — and instead make do with canned goods and freebies around campus. ""This is what I have to do to save money,"" he said last month at his parents' home in Jamaica, Queens. ""That's how it's going to be."" Through Children's Aid, one of the eight agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Mr. Williams got help for the fall semester, receiving $652.85 from the fund for meals and textbooks. He hopes to stay steadily nourished until May, when he graduates and plans to get a job in web design. Born in the tropical South American country of Guyana, Mr. Williams still has not quite gotten used to the snow on Cornell's campus in Ithaca, N.Y. He grew up in Guyana's capital, Georgetown, where mango, guava and cashew trees grew in his backyard. His parents made and sold hats from a vendor's stand downtown, but they wanted better economic and educational opportunities for their five children. With his family, Mr. Williams immigrated to the United States in 2008 in the midst of the recession. Settling down in Brooklyn, they joined other family members in a two-bedroom apartment that now housed 13. Mr. Williams slept next to his cousin on a bottom bunk, while his two brothers shared the top. ""We slept fine,"" he said. ""It wasn't something we thought about that much."" Still, those early years in the United States were difficult for the Williams family. In their second Brooklyn apartment, they contended with difficult neighbors, and one night, Mr. Williams's father was mugged and had to stay home for a week tending to his injuries. ""We didn't feel safe there,"" Mr. Williams said. ""That was the worst experience."" While his parents worked low-wage service jobs in the city, they instilled in their children a tireless academic work ethic. Mr. Williams became a standout student at Benjamin Banneker Academy, excelling particularly in math and English. He tutored math after school, earned scholarships to help pay for college and graduated on the honor roll. Several prestigious colleges accepted him, but ""I had to look at the financial aid package to determine if I would be able to go or not,"" he said. The initial package that Cornell offered in 2015 seemed like a dream come true: The university covered all first-year costs except for a student contribution fee. Tuition costs rose each year, though, and so did the contribution fees for Mr. Williams and his parents. A $350 student health fee, which caused an uproar on campus, was also put into effect. And a policy change required over 2,000 students, including Mr. Williams, to spend about $2,800 on the school's health insurance this year. His application for a waiver, relying on his mother's insurance plan, was denied. (Cornell has changed the policy to allow more students to waive the school plan for the next calendar year.) So Mr. Williams turned to loans and money from his parents to stay afloat. He also works at a laboratory on campus, where he cleans up after experiments — but he has little time to earn additional money, given the coursework for his five classes this semester. After class, he cooks simple meals for himself. His favorite childhood foods — like Guyanese cook-up rice — are too challenging and expensive to make, so he often relies on pasta, canned beans and chicken tenders. He watches a GroupMe message channel on campus that points students to free food and shows up to those events. ""I always find a way,"" he said. Mr. Williams says that he does not often talk about his financial struggles with his classmates. But hunger is a pervasive problem across college campuses, affecting millions of students, according to a survey released this year by Temple University and the Wisconsin HOPE Lab. Of the 43,000 students at 66 colleges surveyed, 36 percent had trouble getting enough to eat on a daily basis. For Mr. Williams, his student loans are a constant source of anxiety. ""In the back of my mind, I'm always telling myself, 'Once you graduate, all this money's going to accumulate. You're going to be in debt,'"" he said. After graduation, Mr. Williams plans to earn an internship or job in front-end software or web design. He is interested in designing apps and also has aspirations to publish his poetry and short stories. His ultimate goal is to be his own boss, so that he does not have to rely on anyone except for himself. ""At some point in my life, I hope to be self-employed,"" he said. ""I can't imagine myself working for someone else my entire life."" Donations to the Neediest Cases may be made online, or with a check or over the phone."
News,2018-12-08,Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is not shy about sharing his taste for chocolate milk.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/us/trump-school-lunch-usda.html,806," Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is not shy about sharing his taste for chocolate milk. ""I wouldn't be as big as I am today without chocolate milk,"" Mr. Perdue told reporters in May 2017, while discussing his plan to relax Obama-era school lunch rules. It was one of his first days on the job. This week, the United States Department of Agriculture announced its final plans to lower nutrition standards for grains, flavored milks and sodium in school cafeterias that were part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and that Michelle Obama, the former first lady, had advocated. The changes, all of which will go into effect by July, apply to school meals that qualify for at least some federal reimbursement. They may seem relatively minor on paper, but like many Trump administration moves to reverse Obama-era policies, they come with some controversy. First, the grains: The Obama-era rules required that schools must serve entirely ""whole grain-rich"" foods, meaning that the product — whether it is pizza, pasta or hamburger buns — must contain at least 50 percent whole grains. Under the new rules, only half of the grain products on the cafeteria's weekly menu must be whole grain-rich. Theoretically, that means schools could serve all whole grain-rich food three days a week and food made with refined grains the other two days. The Trump administration asserts in the new rules that administrators have struggled to find food products that meet these standards while also pleasing students. Schools have been able to request exemptions from the rules if they demonstrate financial hardship, and the government has said the most popular requests have been for regional staples like grits in the South and tortillas in the Southwest. But the current administration asserted that the exemptions process was not sustainable and that some schools found it too burdensome. Not all food service administrators have problems with the current rules. Ann Cooper, the food service director for Boulder Valley Schools, in Colorado, said the district served only whole grain-rich foods and never received complaints. It is hard for many students to even tell when foods like tortillas are made with some whole grain flour, said Ms. Cooper, who is also the president of the Chef Ann Foundation, which provides grants to help schools serve healthier food. ""It's not like in the 1960s when whole grain was like eating a hockey puck,"" she said. ""Do we really need more white bread in our schools?"" As for the milk, the Trump administration is allowing schools to serve low-fat flavored milks, rather than just the nonfat version. This change was already in place for this school year, but Thursday's announcement made it permanent. The rationale, according to the new rules, is to make sure children keep up their milk consumption. ""The kids told me that the flavored milk, which was limited to nonfat, was not as tasty as they would like,"" Mr. Perdue said at the May 2017 news conference. To back up the rule change, the Agriculture Department cited its own study concluding that milk consumption per person had decreased from 2000 to 2016, though the data is not specific to children. Miguel Villarreal, director of food and nutritional services for the Novato Unified School District in Northern California, said the district had chosen not to serve flavored milk at its schools at all because of the sugar content. ""It's like giving them a can of soda,"" he said. Mr. Villarreal said when flavored milk was removed from the menu, milk consumption did drop temporarily until students became accustomed to the unflavored version. ""If I can educate the kids to drink nonflavored milk, then we're doing a service for those kids,"" he said. The Trump administration's new sodium rules are less polarizing. Schools will still have to reduce sodium in lunches, but they will not be required to do so as aggressively. The School Nutrition Association, an advocacy organization that represents school-food professionals, cheered the new regulations in a news release on Thursday, praising the Trump administration for its flexibility with the standards. The group counts many of the country's largest food companies among its backers. Karen Perry Stillerman, a senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said it was unclear why the Trump administration would backtrack when schools were in good standing with the nutritional goals. A 2016 news release from the U.S.D.A. said that more than 99 percent of schools in the country reported that they were meeting the Obama-era standards. Ms. Stillerman said she would prefer that the government offer extra help to schools that were not meeting the nutritional requirements rather than lowering the standards across the country. ""It seems like a small thing,"" she said. ""But the behavioral research shows you have to offer nutritious food to kids over and over and be consistent."""

The Rev. Ross Lang, a Presbyterian minister, officiated, with Msgr. John J. Carroll taking part in a ceremony that incorporated both Presbyterian and Catholic wedding traditions. The bride, 35, works in the investor relations department at Bain Capital in New York. She graduated from New England College in Henniker, N.H. She is a daughter of Cyndi Webb of Mountain Lakes, and the late Bill Webb. The bride's father was a Major League Baseball television sports director for both Fox Sports and New York Mets telecasts on SNY. He directed 17 World Series, 18 All-Star Games and many other significant sports events, including the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. He also won dozens of Emmy Awards as part of various broadcast teams throughout his career, and seven individual Emmys. In 2016, he was elected to the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. Mr. McCarthy, who is 40 and works in Billings, Mont., is an assistant United States attorney for the District of Montana. He graduated from Notre Dame, from which he also received a law degree. He is a son of Carolyn S. McCarthy and G. Daniel McCarthy of Scottsdale, Ariz. The groom's father retired as a partner in Gibbons, a law firm in Newark. He was previously general counsel of the Hewlett-Packard Financial Services Company in Murray Hill, N.J. Ms. Webb and Mr. McCarthy first met in March 2017 during a ski trip in Big Sky, Mont. ""There was just something so captivating about him,"" Ms. Webb said. ""He was super-funny and charismatic, and a gentleman in an old-school kind of way, which reminded me of my dad."" Two weeks after they met, Mr. McCarthy went on a business trip to Columbia, S.C., and arranged to meet Ms. Webb for a long weekend in Charleston, about two hours away. ""She was smart and beautiful and someone who made me laugh so easily,"" said Mr. McCarthy, who grew up in Chatham, N.J. ""Though I felt she was completely out of my league, I thought 'Well, let me at least give this thing a shot.'"" After exploring Charleston together, they had dinner at a local bistro and decided to continue seeing each other despite the fact that they were living on opposite sides of the country, she in Boston and he in Billings. ""Talking with her was so easy, it was as if she was someone I had known my whole life,"" Mr. McCarthy said. ""We also have a lot in common given the fact that we grew up not far from each other in New Jersey."" Ms. Webb said she is looking forward to the day when she and Mr. McCarthy can eliminate the distance between them. ""It's been about two years since we've been going back and forth to see each other,"" she said, ""but I'm anxious to begin living with Brendan and starting a family together."""
News,2018-12-08,"This article was reported and written in collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit journalism organization.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/health/medical-journals-conflicts-of-interest.html,2001," This article was reported and written in collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit journalism organization. One is dean of Yale's medical school. Another is the director of a cancer center in Texas. A third is the next president of the most prominent society of cancer doctors. These leading medical figures are among dozens of doctors who have failed in recent years to report their financial relationships with pharmaceutical and health care companies when their studies are published in medical journals, according to a review by The New York Times and ProPublica and data from other recent research. Dr. Howard A. ""Skip"" Burris III, the president-elect of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, for instance, declared that he had no conflicts of interest in more than 50 journal articles in recent years, including in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. However, drug companies have paid his employer nearly $114,000 for consulting and speaking, and nearly $8 million for his research during the period for which disclosure was required. His omissions extended to the Journal of Clinical Oncology, which is published by the group he will lead. In addition to the widespread lapses by doctors, the review by The Times and ProPublica found that journals themselves often gave confusing advice and did not routinely vet disclosures by researchers, although many relationships could have been easily detected on a federal database. Medical journals, which are the main conduit for communicating the latest scientific discoveries to the public, often have an interdependent relationship with the researchers who publish in their pages. Reporting a study in a leading journal can heighten their profile — not to mention that of the drug or other product being tested. And journals enhance their cachet by publishing exclusive, breakthrough studies by acclaimed researchers. In all, the reporting system still appears to have many of the same flaws that the Institute of Medicine identified nearly a decade ago when it recommended fundamental changes in how conflicts of interest are reported. Those have yet to happen. A review by The New York Times and ProPublica found that dozens of doctors have failed to disclose significant conflicts of interests in their journal papers. ""The system is broken,"" said Dr. Mehraneh Dorna Jafari, an assistant professor of surgery at the University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine. She and her colleagues  published a study in August that found that, of the 100 doctors who received the most compensation from device makers in 2015, conflicts were disclosed in only 37 percent of the articles published in the next year. ""The journals aren't checking and the rules are different for every single thing."" Calls for transparency stem from concerns that researchers' ties to the health and drug industries increase the odds they will, consciously or not, skew results to favor the companies with whom they do business. Studies have found that industry-sponsored research tends to be more positive than research financed by other sources. And that in turn can sway which treatments become available to patients. There is no indication that the research done by Dr. Burris and the other doctors with incomplete disclosures was manipulated or falsified. Journal editors say they are introducing changes that will better standardize disclosures and reduce errors. But some have also argued that since most researchers follow the rules, stringent new requirements would be costly and unnecessary. The issue has gained traction since September, when Dr. José Baselga, who was the chief medical officer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, resigned after The Times and ProPublica reported that he had not revealed his industry ties in dozens of journal articles. [Read more about doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering and their financial relationships with companies.] Dr. Burris, president of clinical operations and chief medical officer at the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, referred questions about the payments to his employer. It defended him, saying the payments were made to the institution, although The New England Journal of Medicine requires disclosure of all such payments. Other prominent researchers who have submitted erroneous disclosures include Dr. Robert J. Alpern, the dean of the Yale School of Medicine, who failed to disclose in a 2017 journal article about an experimental treatment developed by Tricida that he served on that company's board of directors and owned its stock. Tricida, which is developing therapies for chronic kidney disease, had financed the clinical trial that was the subject of the article. Dr. Alpern said in an email that he initially believed that his disclosure — that he had been a consultant for Tricida — was adequate. However, ""because of concerns recently raised about disclosures,"" he said he notified the publication, The Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, in October that he also served on Tricida's board and had stock holdings in the company. The journal initially told Dr. Alpern that his disclosure was sufficient. But after The Times and ProPublica contacted the publication in November, it said it would correct the article. ""The failure to disclose this information at the time of peer review is a violation of our policy,"" Dr. Rajnish Mehrotra, the journal's editor in chief, said in an email. He later said that an additional inquiry had revealed that all 12 of the article's authors had submitted incomplete disclosures, and that the journal planned to refer the matter to the ethics committee of the American Society of Nephrology. Dr. Mehrotra also said that the journal had decided to conduct an audit of some recent articles to evaluate the broader issue. Dr. Carlos L. Arteaga, the director of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center in Dallas, said he had ""nothing to disclose"" as an author of a 2016 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine of the breast cancer drug Kisqali, made by Novartis. But Dr. Arteaga had received more than $50,000 from drug companies in the three-year disclosure period, including more than $14,000 from Novartis. In an email, Dr. Arteaga described the omission as an ""inexcusable oversight and error on my part,"" and subsequently submitted a correction. Dr. Jeffrey R. Botkin, an associate vice president for research at the University of Utah, recently argued in JAMA, a leading medical journal, that researchers should face misconduct charges when they do not disclose their relationships with interested companies. ""They really are falsifying the information that others rely on to assess that research,"" he said. ""Money is a very powerful influencer, and people's opinions become subtly biased by that financial relationship."" But Dr. Howard C. Bauchner, the editor in chief of JAMA, said that verifying each author's disclosures would not be worth the time or effort. ""The vast majority of authors are honest and do want to fulfill their obligations to tell readers and editors what their conflicts of interest could be,"" he said in an interview. As the debate continues, an influential group, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, is considering a policy that would refer researchers who commit major disclosure errors to their institutions for possible charges of research misconduct. Concerns about the influence of drug companies on medical research have persisted for decades. Senator Estes Kefauver held hearings on the issue in 1959, and there was another surge of concern in the 2000s after a series of scandals in which prominent doctors failed to reveal their industry relationships. Medical journals and professional societies strengthened their requirements. The drug industry restricted how it compensates doctors, prohibiting gifts like tickets to sporting events or luxury trips — although evidence of kickbacks and corruption continues to surface in criminal prosecutions. And a 2010 federal law required pharmaceutical and device makers to publicly report their payments to physicians. Despite these changes, the system for disclosing conflicts remains fragmented and weakly enforced. Medical journals and professional societies have a variety of guidelines about what types of relationships must be reported, often leaving it up to the researcher to decide what is relevant. There are few repercussions — beyond a correction — for those who fail to follow the rules. For example, the American Association for Cancer Research has warned authors that they face a three-year ban if they are found to have omitted a potential conflict. But the group's policy on conflicts of interest contains no mention of such a penalty, and it said no author had ever been barred. Dr. Baselga's failure to disclose his industry relationships extended to the association's journal, Cancer Discovery, for which he serves as one of two editors in chief. The association said it is investigating Dr. Baselga's actions. Most authors do seem to disclose their ties to corporate interests. About two-thirds of the authors on the Kisqali study, for example, reported relationships with companies, including Novartis. But the researchers who did not included Dr. Arteaga, Dr. Burris and Dr. Denise A. Yardley, a senior investigator who works with Dr. Burris at Sarah Cannon. The Tennessee-based research center received more than $105,000 in fees for consulting, speaking and other services on Dr. Yardley's behalf in the three-year period in which she declared no conflicts. The Sarah Cannon institute said it switched over a year ago to a ""universal disclosure"" practice promoted by ASCO, the cancer group that Dr. Burris will lead. That requires doctors to disclose all payments, including those made to their institutions. ""We believe we adhere to the highest ethical standards in the industry by not allowing personal compensation to be paid to our leadership physicians,"" the center said. ASCO said it would post corrections to Dr. Burris's disclosures in The Journal of Clinical Oncology for the past four years. The group said that in the fall of 2017 — as Dr. Burris was seeking a leadership role in the organization — it began working with him to disclose all his company relationships, including indirect payments. Dr. Burris will become president in June 2019. ""Disclosure systems and processes in medicine are not perfect yet, and neither are ASCO's,"" the group said in an email. Dr. Burris, Dr. Yardley and Dr. Arteaga submitted updated disclosures to The New England Journal of Medicine, which posted them on Thursday. Dr. Burris's updated disclosure listed relationships with 30 companies, including that he provided expert testimony for Novartis. Other studies recently published by the New England Journal of Medicine also omitted disclosures, including one on a 2018 study on a treatment for sickle cell disease and another on the recently approved cancer drug Vitravki, to be sold by Bayer and Loxo Oncology. Jennifer Zeis, a spokeswoman for the journal, said that it was contacting those studies' authors, and that it now asked researchers to certify that they had checked their disclosures against the federal database. Some institutions have pushed back, arguing that the journals' inconsistent rules make it difficult for even well-meaning researchers to do the right thing. In a letter last month To the New England Journal of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering objected to the treatment of one of its top researchers, Dr. Jedd Wolchok. When he tried to correct his disclosures, the journal shifted its position, from saying its editors were satisfied with his disclosures to saying he had failed to comply with the rules, the center said in citing communications with the journal. Dr. Wolchok, a pioneer in cancer immunotherapy, ultimately corrected 13 articles and letters to the editor. To clarify reporting requirements, several publications are attempting only now to do what the Institute of Medicine recommended in 2009. The New England Journal is testing a new system in partnership with the Association of American Medical Colleges that would act as a central repository for reporting financial relationships. This year, JAMA began requiring authors to confirm multiple times that they had nothing to disclose. ASCO has a centralized system for reporting conflicts to all of its journals and speaker presentations. Dr. Bernard Lo, the chairman of the 2009 Institute of Medicine panel, said journals have only begun to confront some of the systemic flaws. ""They're certainly not out in front trying to be trailblazers, let me just say it that way,"" he said. ""The fact that it hasn't been done means that nobody has it on their priority list."""

Op-Ed,2018-12-08,"You’d agree, wouldn’t you, that Consideration No. 1 in choosing a Democratic nominee in 2020 is making sure that he or she is the person best positioned to defeat Donald Trump? That nothing else comes close?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/opinion/sunday/biden-2020-dont-run.html,1241," You'd agree, wouldn't you, that Consideration No. 1 in choosing a Democratic nominee in 2020 is making sure that he or she is the person best positioned to defeat Donald Trump? That nothing else comes close? Then what would you say if I told you that we should put our chips on a man who failed miserably at two previous campaigns for the nomination, the first one all the way back in 1988, a year before Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was born? And that when he applied the lessons from that debacle to his second bid two decades later, he did no better, placing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, getting fewer than 1 percent of the state's delegates and folding his tent before even the New Hampshire primary? And that he spent nearly 45 years in Washington, a proper noun that's a dirty word in presidential politics? And that his record includes laws and episodes that are reviled — rightly — by the female and black voters so integral to the Democratic Party? And that, on Election Day, he would be 77, which is 31 years older than Bill Clinton was in 1992, 30 years older than Barack Obama was in 2008 and a complete contradiction of the party's success over the last half-century with relatively youthful candidates? You'd tell me that I was of unsound mind. Well, Joe Biden's boosters are. Right now there's a swell of talk about, and interest in, a Biden candidacy. Last Monday he told an audience in Montana that none of the other Democrats eyeing the White House were as qualified as he is, and it sounded like the beginnings of a stump speech. A terrible stump speech at that. If what Biden took away from the 2016 election was that qualifications rule the day, I'd urge him to ask Hillary Clinton how consoling her impeccable credentials are and then to educate me on the gold-plated wonders of Trump's C.V. A national poll two weeks ago showed that Biden was far ahead of other Democrats in a hypothetical primary field, winning the favor of 25 percent of respondents in comparison with 15 percent for Bernie Sanders, 13 for Hillary Clinton, 9 for Beto O'Rourke and under 5 each for Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris. But that's name recognition multiplied by nostalgia. And nostalgia is a risky currency and an odd fit for a party that last claimed the White House with a mantra of hope and change. An article about Biden that The Atlantic published on Thursday said that ""people keep coming up to him everywhere he goes"" to profess their longing and love. It quoted one 89-year-old woman who told Biden: ""If you promise to run, I'll promise to stay alive long enough to vote for you."" She clearly admires him very much. I do, too. He's an admirable person. How I wish that mattered more in terms of the outcome of a presidential election than it obviously does. He pressed on with public service long after he could have cashed in. His devotion to his family is palpable; his strength through its tragedies, extraordinary. He's informed, he's affable and he's real. But is he the best bet? The difference between four and eight years of Trump could be everything; this is a time for ruthlessly unemotional calculation. Show me persuasive evidence that the president's most fearsome adversary is an avocado and I'll whip up the corresponding paraphernalia: Make America Guac Again. And you know what? By the time 2020 rolls around, perhaps an avocado could beat Trump. We await Robert Mueller's report while being reminded daily of how staggeringly thorough his inquiry has been. We could be on the cusp of a recession. Even amid strong economic indicators, voters issued a clear repudiation of Trump in the midterm elections, as the Democrats picked up at least 40 House seats.  But we should plan for a worst-case scenario — for a Trump who's wounded but not critically or who has managed to hit some kind of herky-jerky homestretch stride. We should be cleareyed about each Democratic contender's shortcomings and vulnerabilities. Biden, who followed 36 years as a senator from Delaware with eight as Obama's vice president, has many. His record is one of them. There's prodigious accomplishment there but also trouble: his stern treatment of Anita Hill when she appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which he was chairman; his role as an ambassador for the financial services industry in Delaware; his key part in the passage of crime bills that ended up punishing African-Americans disproportionately. None of that jibes with his party's current priorities and mood. The very scope of that record isn't ideal. ""It would be so nice, after Hillary, to have someone without years and years of votes and baggage,"" one Democratic strategist told me. Biden's long history, she added, ""is a treasure trove for any opponent."" Then there's Biden's famous propensity for cringe-inducing gaffes. Maybe those would be less noticeable or relevant than before, given the nature and nuttiness of Trump's expectorations. But maybe they'd muffle the substance of his message. Between his verbal fumbling, his attempts to recover from it and all the shiny, meaningless objects that Trump gets journalists to chase, a Biden-Trump matchup could turn into a total circus, and who flourishes in that kind of habitat? Trump. He can out-clown Bozo and the specter in ""It"" combined. While Biden, at 76, is only four years older than Trump, Democrats have had more luck over recent decades with presidential candidates younger than their Republican opponents. ""In the last century, the party has never won with a non-incumbent who was older than 52,"" Thor Hogan, who teaches politics at Earlham College, wrote in The Washington Post recently. That ""makes perfect sense,"" Hogan added. ""Democrats are the party of progress, of hope and of change."" They're already straining that brand with their trio of top leaders in the House: Nancy Pelosi, 78; Steny Hoyer, 79; and Jim Clyburn, 78. They're going to plump up the septuagenarian society further with their 2020 nominee? ""It would be tragic for Democrats to squander an obvious chance at an age and health and vigor and generational contrast to Trump,"" another Democratic strategist said. That's a contrast plenty of local Democratic operatives want. On the same day that Biden trumpeted his qualifications in Montana, The Wall Street Journal reported that it had surveyed the Democratic chairmen and chairwomen of all 99 counties in Iowa; that 76 responded; and that while there was no consensus on the issues or positions that a 2020 nominee should emphasize, 43 of these leaders indicated a preference for ""a young candidate"" and ""a fresh face."" As that latter phrase suggests, Biden's problem isn't just age. A candidate can be old in years and relatively new to presidential politics (Elizabeth Warren, 69; Mike Bloomberg, 76) or old in years and the champion of new directions (Bernie Sanders, 77). Neither of those descriptions applies to Biden. His party can't get enough of the word ""progressive,"" but he's regressive, symbolizing a step back to an administration past. Don't get me wrong: That's infinitely preferable to the indecent present. But it's a questionable campaign slogan. He has said that he'll decide in the next month or two whether to run — whether he's willing to spend that much time away from his grandchildren. For their sake, I hope he stays on the sidelines. For our sake, too. I invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter. You can follow me on Twitter (@FrankBruni). "

",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/opinion/sunday/paul-manafort-lies.html,1097," Maybe Paul Manafort simply has more chutzpah than the rest of us. Here's a man convicted of financial fraud, facing further criminal prosecution for the lies he's accused of telling, who makes a deal to protect himself and proceeds, according to a memo sent to a federal judge on Friday, to lie to the prosecutors. Accused of lying, he offers as evidence in his defense … what appear to be more lies. There are no good reasons to believe him, and yet he seems to brashly lie nevertheless.  When we look at photos of Mr. Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, coming and going from court, he tends to be smiling, the proud, bold deceiver. When we see pictures of Mr. Trump's disgraced former lawyer Michael Cohen, by contrast, we see the glum, shamefaced confessor of the truth. But perhaps chutzpah does not entirely explain Mr. Manafort's dishonesty. When considering the virtue of truthfulness and its opposite, mendaciousness, Aristotle identified two common kinds of lying characters: the boaster and the flatterer. The boaster, he said, ""claims more than he has"" and is ""a contemptible sort of fellow"" but ""seems futile rather than bad."" The vanity of the boaster is easily spotted, and consequently he tends to harm no one other than himself. He is at best a kind of amusing buffoon; at worst, an annoyance. It seems to me this is one helpful way to think about a case like Mr. Manafort's. The notorious $15,000 ostrich jacket, the desperate living beyond his means, the ostentatiousness — these all very predictably go with the pretense of the boaster. Why would Mr. Manafort lie, even to Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor? At least one reason would be that he's showing off. There is something of the flatterer, too, in Mr. Manafort. The flatterer does to another what the boaster does to himself. With his lies, he tries to convince the one he flatters that the flattered is better than he is in reality. The flatterer affects this simulation, of course, because he seeks to gain some advantage for himself by pleasing the flattered. For this reason I suspect that Mr. Mueller and his team have heard as much praise from Paul Manafort as Donald Trump must have, back when they were still palling around. Aristotle's famous point about virtue and vice is that both are habits that one cultivates. A case like Mr. Manafort's, by these lights, is more a cause for pity than for anger, and is easy to make sense of: Why would Mr. Manafort continue to dissimulate, even when it clearly runs counter to his own interests? Well, because that's what he's always done and always does. He doesn't exactly intend to mislead; it's just what comes naturally. Even if Mr. Manafort is consciously, deliberately lying, he's foolish to do it and he's doing a bad job of it. Of course, he may well have a Machiavellian rationale in his head. ""Those best at playing the fox have done better than the others,"" Machiavelli wrote, speaking of the powerful. ""But you have to know how to disguise your slyness, how to pretend one thing and cover up another."" There are many more such arguments in defense of the necessity of lying for people who want to control the rest of us, and indeed this view agrees with what most of us believe about politicians in particular and power player types in general. Even Machiavelli, however, insisted that one must avoid lying too much, because people will stop believing you, and your lies will no longer work. Before we get carried away feeling superior to Mr. Manafort, we should admit we are all experts in deception. Politeness and other forms of social expediency prevent us from telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth every day. Evolutionary psychologists teach us that lies, self-deception and hypocrisy are essential to ordinary psychological well-being and the survival of the human species. We bluff our way through a lot of life.  So we might do well to think of Mr. Manafort as a kind of outlier or cautionary tale, an extreme example of a weakness we all share, rather than as a case of exceptional vice in the midst of our more ordinary virtue. Although many of us would like to think of Mr. Manafort as a scheming, calculating, coldblooded Prince of Lies, it's probably the case that he has told so many different stories over the course of a long career as a liar that at this point he longer quite knows what the truth is. As Nietzsche taught us, we tend to deceive ourselves about when, how and why we lie, and even about the act of lying itself.  Why? At least in part because lies are more effective when we don't know that we are lying. ""There must be self-deception in order to produce a great effect,"" Nietzsche wrote. If this is true, unfortunately for Mr. Manafort — and, one worries, for our president — one can become so confused about the distinction between truth and falsity that one can no longer really tell the difference. We might actually prefer that Mr. Manafort be a straightforward liar, because the unmindful liar is more dangerous, both to himself and to others. As Mr. Dryden admonishes T.E. Lawrence in ""Lawrence of Arabia"": ""If we've been telling lies, you've been telling half-lies. A man who tells lies, like me, merely hides the truth. But a man who tells half-lies has forgotten where he put it."" I think, in short, that we can learn from the pitiable case of Paul Manafort. The truth requires courage rather than cowardice. For us ordinary human beings, the right thing to do is most often the difficult thing to do, and this is especially so when it comes to knowing and speaking the truth. It's almost always easier, lazier, more convenient to boast, to flatter, to lie, to fail to interrogate yourself about why you believe what you do. But we've seen where these habits led Mr. Manafort, over the course of his life, and none of us want to join him there. And what about Mr. Manafort? Like most liars, he's probably feeling lonely, with only his secrets to comfort him. But if I'm right, and he no longer really knows the difference between truth and lie, he's lost even his secrets.

So for guidance he called an old friend in Bladenboro, L. McCrae Dowless Jr., a low-level local official with a criminal record who nonetheless had once been feted as ""guru of elections"" in Bladen County. Mr. Dowless soon had the sealed ballots in his hands and was off to the post office to mail them, Mr. Thompson said. Mr. Thompson, who works in the maintenance department at a DuPont plant, said in an interview he was grateful. But the act was apparently illegal in North Carolina, where, except in limited circumstances, it is a felony to collect another person's absentee ballot. In this rural region near the state's southern border, where candidates are often intimately known as neighbors, friends or enemies, Mr. Dowless ran a do-it-all vote facilitating business that was part of the community fabric. While cash-driven voter turnout efforts are a cottage industry in campaign seasons, Mr. Dowless's operation appeared to run like a family business that crossed lines laid out in election law. Dozens of interviews and an examination of thousands of pages of documents portray Mr. Dowless, a former car salesman, as a local political opportunist who was quick to seek ballots, collect them or offer rides to the polls. He employed a network of part-time helpers, some of them his own relatives, who, lured by promises of swift cash payments, would fan out across southeastern North Carolina in get-out-the-vote efforts for whichever candidate happened to be footing that year's bill. But that network operated with little oversight and accountability, critics say, and now Mr. Dowless has drawn national scrutiny amid a sprawling electoral fraud investigation that could result in a rare redo in a race for Congress. Investigators are examining accounts of Mr. Dowless and people connected to his operation collecting absentee ballots directly from residents. Word of this apparent practice has stirred fears that those ballots were reported — or not reported — in ways that helped the Republican nominee, Mark Harris, to prevail by just 905 votes last month. The state's election board has declined to certify Mr. Harris as the winner in the Ninth Congressional District, and is expected to hold an evidentiary hearing this month. On Friday, the state identified Mr. Dowless as a ""person of interest"" in its investigation. The scandal has been a setback for Mr. Harris, a pastor-turned-aspiring lawmaker whose campaign strategists hired Mr. Dowless for a get-out-the vote drive. And it has been an embarrassment for leaders of the Republican Party, who have spent years fretting that electoral fraud could come from undocumented immigrants. Now they are grappling with the possibility that it may have come from one of their own. But over the years, Democrats and Republicans alike in North Carolina courted Mr. Dowless, who, over almost 15 years, went from being a registered Democrat to unaffiliated to Democrat to unaffiliated to Republican. They fraternized with him, and hired him to work his magic in service of boosting their vote tallies. They did so even though local news reports going back to at least 2010 noted his criminal record, which included felony convictions for perjury and fraud. And they did so despite longstanding rumors that his get-out-the-vote tactics were unsavory at the least, and perhaps illegal. ""I only knew of him that he was crooked, as far as elections are concerned, and he had a way of doing it, and avoided prosecution and that kind of thing,"" said Ben Snyder, the chairman of the Bladen County Democratic Party, who said he did not meet Mr. Dowless in person until 2016. Dallas Woodhouse, the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, said he had heard ""a lot of chatter"" about voter turnout operations over the years in Bladen County but paid it little mind because prosecutors never brought cases. ""Nothing sort of ever happened,"" he said, ""so I think you assume that there's a whole lot of noise."" In Bladen County this year, Mr. Harris won 61 percent of the accepted absentee ballots, even though registered Republicans accounted for only 19 percent of the ballots submitted. Both the state elections board and the United States House of Representatives, which Democrats will control beginning in January, could force a new election in North Carolina. On Wednesday night, Mr. Dowless opened his door with a cigarette between his knuckles as a holiday light machine projected a whirling, speckled glow onto his modest house. In the side yard, a campaign sign for Mr. Harris rested in the grass. Mr. Dowless said he could not talk, given the controversy. ""I don't mean to be rude,"" he said. On Friday, he again declined to be interviewed but this time recited a phone number for a lawyer, who did not respond to a message. Local residents said Mr. Dowless — who is also a soil and water conservation district supervisor — was busy but available. ""If you need help he's going to help you out,"" said Barry Hester, 64, a retired construction worker who went to high school with Mr. Dowless. ""Like people who aren't so fortunate. If they need a ride, they'll call McCrae.'' Politicians and voters said Mr. Dowless depended on cash and a short paper trail. ""Everything was verbal,"" said Pete Givens, who briefly hired Mr. Dowless for a Charlotte City Council campaign last year. The Dowless operation also relied on workers like Ginger Eason, who told WSOC, a Charlotte television station, that Mr. Dowless paid her $75 to $100 a week to go door to door this year to encourage people to vote for Mr. Harris and a candidate for sheriff. She also said she picked up completed absentee ballots and brought them to Mr. Dowless, but was not sure what he did with them. ""I don't know nothing what happened after I dropped them off,"" she said. Kirby Wright, 47, and his mother, Doris Lee Hammonds, 77, recall that a women they recognized as Ms. Eason came to their home one night to pick up their absentee ballots. The pair had thick envelopes containing their absentee ballots but never filled them out. When Ms. Eason came by, she said she needed them. ""I told her I was going to throw it away,"" Mr. Wright said in an interview. ""It was blank. She said, 'No, I've got to pick up all the empty ballots.'"" Ms. Eason could not be reached for comment. Mr. Wright said he isn't sure what happened to the ballot designated for his mother, who is bedridden. It might have been thrown in the trash, he said. But state records show Ms. Hammonds cast an absentee ballot by mail. Ms. Hammonds, also interviewed, said she never filled it out or signed the absentee ballot at all. Ms. Eason told the Charlotte television station that she never discarded any ballots. But a large number of unreturned absentee ballots in Bladen County, as well as adjacent Robeson County, prompted concerns among elections officials, campaign strategists and independent researchers that Mr. Dowless's network may have engaged in wider fraud. So do the accounts of some voters. At Village Oaks, an apartment complex in Bladenboro, several residents said they had seen a truck at the complex with a Harris campaign placard at the same time that groups of three or four women would appear to collect ballots or encourage people to request absentee ballots during election season. ""They were around, saying they would help people cast absentee ballots,"" said Barbie Silvas, who mailed in a ballot this year. ""They said, 'I'm here for McCrae to help people to vote.'"" Mr. Dowless appeared in the news in the early 1990s after he was accused of taking out, and collecting on, a life insurance policy on an employee who had just died, backdating it and forging a signature. He ultimately spent about six months in prison, according to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety. Less than two decades later, he was one of a handful of get-out-the-vote experts who wielded significant influence in Bladen County, a struggling rural area where one in four people live below the poverty line. Records show that beginning in 2009, at least seven Democratic and Republican candidates paid him for work. In 2010, Mr. Dowless worked for a Democratic candidate for district attorney. A local television station at that time named Mr. Dowless as one of ""a few heavy hitters in the Bladen County get-out-the-vote arena."" Part of the local political culture, the station reported, involved political operatives distributing sample ballots for which they had sold spots to the highest-bidding candidates. The Republican candidate, Jonathan M. David, eventually won the election. He criticized the pay-to-play tactics, which he said ""lets a small group of people who don't have the best interest of the community at heart, but their own financial interest at stake, to dictate who becomes important leaders in their community."" That same year produced a political landmark for Bladen County, which elected a Democrat as its first black sheriff. The racial backlash — the county was then 56 percent white and 35 percent black — was palpable, recalled Patsy Sheppard, now a vice chairwoman of the local Democratic Party. She recalled hearing her fellow whites say, ""We need a white sheriff."" When a white challenger, James A. McVicker, emerged in 2014, Mr. Dowless was able to earn several thousand dollars in cash helping to get him elected by running a 20-worker absentee ballot operation. According to records in a lawsuit, Mr. Dowless was paid $5,800 in cash by Jeffrey Smith, the owner of a video gambling parlor, who was worried that the incumbent sheriff would raid the business. Mr. McVicker, a Republican, won — and Mr. Smith's business was raided anyway. His company filed a lawsuit against the new sheriff and noted that Mr. McVicker had won the election by almost 350 votes. Mr. Smith's lawyers implied in a court filing that without ""Mr. Dowless' efforts"" on absentee ballots, Mr. McVicker would not have won. In 2014, state records show, Mr. Dowless opened a consulting business with Jens L. Lutz, a local Democratic activist. Mr. Lutz, one of two Democrats on Bladen County's four-member elections board, said Friday that he only went into business with Mr. Dowless as a kind of sleuthing operation to root out the unethical tactics he thought Mr. Dowless employed. ""I knew there was some suspicion and I was doing it to solidify any suspicion of any wrongdoing,"" Mr. Lutz said, but added that he found it difficult to learn many of Mr. Dowless's methods. (After The New York Times questioned Mr. Lutz on Friday about his dealings with Mr. Dowless, Mr. Lutz resigned from the elections board.) Meanwhile, word had spread to neighboring Robeson County that Mr. Dowless had a formula for delivering victories. Mickey Meekins heard the word, and decided to call Mr. Dowless when decided to run for county commissioner in 2014. But after paying Mr. Dowless $20,000, Mr. Meekins rapidly became disenchanted. ""They actually didn't get no vote,"" said Mr. Meekins, who lost, adding that he assumed Mr. Dowless used sloppy or suspect tactics. In January 2016, the consulting firm he founded with Mr. Lutz dissolved, but Mr. Dowless continued his own work. One client was Todd Johnson, a Republican who, along with Mr. Harris, wanted to unseat Robert M. Pittenger, the incumbent congressman in the Ninth District. Mr. Johnson, who lives near Charlotte, a city almost three hours from Bladen County's seat, finished last in the primary race, but dominated in Bladen. Of 226 absentee-by-mail votes in the county, Mr. Johnson received 221. Mr. Pittenger recalled that he, too, could have hired Mr. Dowless. The men met, the congressman said, but Mr. Pittenger ""quickly ended the meeting over personal concerns with his proposal."" ""We didn't talk long enough for me to gather detailed information,"" Mr. Pittenger said. ""I just knew I didn't want to be involved with him."" In April, just ahead of this year's Republican primary, Herman Dunn, Bladen County's former chief deputy sheriff, saw Mr. Dowless at a polling place. Mr. Dunn wrote in an affidavit that Mr. Dowless told him he was ""doing absentee"" work for both Mr. McVicker, the sheriff, and Mr. Harris. ""You know I don't take checks,"" Mr. Dowless said, according to Mr. Dunn, who had worked for the sheriff Mr. McVicker defeated. ""They have to pay me cash."" According to Mr. Dunn, Mr. Dowless also boasted that he had more than 80 people under his command in Mr. Harris's race. (That figure could not be independently corroborated. Red Dome Group, the consulting firm that contracted with Mr. Dowless on behalf of Mr. Harris's campaign, did not respond to requests for comment.) As the state's investigation into potential fraud continues, people like Jeneva Legions wonder about their voting experiences. Ms. Legions, 30, who lives in the Village Oaks apartments, said she'd had her absentee ballot for a day or two when several women came to her door. One of the women said, 'Are you Jeneva? I've come to get your ballot,'"" Ms. Legions said. When Ms. Legions told them she had not voted yet, one of the women told her she should sign the ballot and fill in her Social Security number. The women left, Ms. Legions said. Not long afterward, one of the women returned. ""I gave it to her,"" Ms. Legions said in a telephone interview. ""I thought she worked for the county. I thought she was one of the voting people coming to get my ballot."" Ms. Legions said she had not sealed the envelope when she gave it to the woman. Her ballot, records show, was never returned to elections officials."
