Editorial,2018-11-05,"One happy reality of the 2018 campaign for New Yorkers is that they are guaranteed to make history on Tuesday: They will elect the state’s first black attorney general, either Letitia James, a Democrat, or Keith Wofford, a Republican.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/opinion/letitia-james-new-york-attorney-general.html,967," One happy reality of the 2018 campaign for New Yorkers is that they are guaranteed to make history on Tuesday: They will elect the state's first black attorney general, either Letitia James, a Democrat, or Keith Wofford, a Republican. New York has reason to be proud of this choice. Mr. Wofford grew up in Buffalo, the son of a father who worked as an autoworker and a mother who worked in retail. He got his law degree at Harvard, and he is now a co-managing partner at the corporate law firm Ropes & Gray, where he focuses on bankruptcy. Ms. James's parents fled a life of sharecropping in the South. She was raised in Brooklyn, attending public schools and, later, Howard University. She is a former prosecutor, City Council member and, for the past five years, the city's public advocate. Each candidate is appealing — and also disconcerting. For someone who has been in politics for years, Ms. James can be surprisingly ill at ease and defensive, didactic rather than persuasive, prone to plumping her record. She has tilted at windmills as public advocate, filing suits to address problems at the public housing authority that had already been fixed, for example. Mr. Wofford has promised to prosecute the corruption that has plagued Albany, including within the administration of Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But he seems unenthusiastic about challenging financial impropriety on Wall Street, an important focus for the office in recent years, and he appears less willing than Ms. James to challenge the policy excesses of President Trump, whom he supports. The Trump administration has abandoned the federal government's regulatory role, enacting policies on the environment, immigration and reproductive rights that hurt New Yorkers, and the president himself has scorned the rule of law. The state needs an attorney general who embraces the full responsibilities of the office. Ms. James has frequently said that she has worked for the powerless while Mr. Wofford has worked for the powerful. It's an easy political slogan. It's also true. And since Ms. James has pledged to use the office's powers vigorously, we endorse her for attorney general. She has a lengthy record of defending New Yorkers from special interests, beginning with her earliest work as an attorney for the Legal Aid Society. From 1999 to 2001, she led the state attorney general's Brooklyn office under Eliot Spitzer, enforcing environmental laws and investigating predatory lenders. In 2003, Ms. James was elected to the City Council, where she waged a vocal campaign against Bloomberg administration development policies she said were pricing out low and moderate-income New Yorkers. She also challenged the Bloomberg administration on the policing policy known as stop and frisk. As public advocate since 2014, she has sometimes been overzealous in her use of lawsuits to address what she sees as inequities in government. Still, her efforts have aimed at using the true power of her office — the bully pulpit — for good, especially when it comes to tenants' rights and the needs of vulnerable children. In the Democratic primary, we picked Zephyr Teachout over Ms. James. Ms. Teachout is an evangelist for ethics, and rooting out corruption is a central challenge for the next state attorney general. In her primary campaign, Ms. James presented herself as part of Mr. Cuomo's team and accepted his fund-raising, acts that raised doubts about her independence.  But Ms. James has promised to push for a law that would allow her to pursue prosecutions without first getting approval from the governor and the Legislature. This would be important if the office is to be truly independent in fighting corruption. She has also wisely said she would ask the highly experienced and capable Barbara Underwood to stay with the office. Ms. Underwood has been acting attorney general since Eric Schneiderman resigned after he was accused of abusing women he dated.  Ms. James has said that as state attorney general she would aggressively enforce environmental laws to protect the state's waterways, and would be equally vigorous in prosecuting wage theft and abuses by landlords. Some questioned her commitment to fighting financial crimes after she said she would not wear the label ""Sheriff of Wall Street"" that had been applied to Mr. Spitzer. But she has vowed to continue the office's use of the state's Martin Act, a nearly 100-year-old law that gives the attorney general broad powers to investigate and prosecute financial fraud. Mr. Wofford thinks Democratic attorneys general have used this law to generate headlines by obtaining attention-grabbing monetary settlements, rather than prosecuting serious crimes. But with Washington rolling back enforcement on many fronts, the Martin Act remains a crucial tool for the attorney general. Then there's President Trump. Mr. Wofford promises that his support for Mr. Trump would not keep him from aggressively pursuing legal action against the president if need be. He has pledged to continue the attorney general's lawsuit to block the administration from asking people who fill out the census whether they are citizens. He said it was worth looking into accusations raised by a New York Times investigation that Mr. Trump evaded millions of dollars of taxes before he became president. But Mr. Wofford said the attorney general's lawsuit against the president and his family over alleged misuse of their foundation was not worth the office's time. Yes, there are many demands on the office, but the questions about whether the Trump Foundation abused its nonprofit status to enrich the Trump family and help Mr. Trump's campaign are not frivolous. The office of attorney general has the authority to serve as a backstop if, as Mr. Trump has suggested, he fires Special Counsel Robert Mueller or pardons aides who might testify against him in the criminal investigation. If Mr. Trump took either step, we're confident that Ms. James would pursue the proper state action. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."

Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/briefing/us-elections-iran-saudi-arabia.html,1381," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning.  Here's the latest: U.S. midterms are nigh, Iranian sanctions are back and chefs look for inspiration in the Amazon. • Closing arguments in the U.S. election. Tumultuous 2018 midterm campaigns barreled through their final weekend and toward Election Day on Tuesday. The most prominent campaigners are on opposite sides of a vast political divide. President Trump has been crisscrossing the country to deliver fear-based messages on immigration and other issues. Former President Barack Obama has been assailing him in a surprisingly sharp, systematic way. Our live polling has many races too close to call, but there's a consensus in both parties that Democrats could take control of the House — while the outlook for the Senate is unclear. We have an overview of the election and scenes from around the U.S. And The Times Magazine looks at an issue shadowing the country: the rise of white nationalism and domestic terrorism, which has flummoxed law enforcement. Far-right groups are thriving online and have been emboldened since Mr. Trump took office. _____ • Sanctions have returned.  By the time you read this briefing, the United States will have reimposed severe economic sanctions on Iran and financial penalties for those who continue to import Iranian goods. Above, Iranian rials at a currency exchange shop in Basra, Iraq. The reinstated sanctions threaten to widen a rift between the U.S. and its European allies, who have criticized President Trump for abandoning the landmark 2015 Iranian nuclear deal. But the U.S. undercut its own sanctions by granting six-month waivers to eight countries — including India, South Korea, Japan and China, among the world's largest importers of Iranian oil. The E.U. did not receive an exemption. Separately, Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin, has been lobbying Washington to save his companies from Trump administration sanctions. His efforts may prove successful. _____ • In Germany, one of the longest dry spells on record has left part of the Rhine, above, at record-low levels for months, causing havoc for many European businesses. Around 80 percent of the cargo transported by ship in Germany travels the Rhine, which many freighters have had to stop plying. Gas stations reliant on the river for fuel delivery from the Netherlands have run dry, and a German chemical plant that uses the Rhine's water had to trim back production. Europeans are bracing for further instability, with one researcher predicting that because of a warming climate, ""the extremes are going to happen more often."" Separately, an environmental group has found new evidence that rogue factories in China are behind the resurgence of the banned gas CFC-11, which destroys the ozone layer and contributes to global warming. _____ • Paradise or ""Death Island""? The Thai island of Koh Tao, above, is popular with Western tourists. But at least nine European visitors have died or disappeared there since 2014, and a rape allegation by a 19-year-old British woman has raised new questions about how the police handle serious crimes against tourists. The police said they had found no evidence to support the rape allegation and arrested 12 people who had posted about it on Facebook. • McKinsey, Booz Allen Hamilton and Boston Consulting have all continued work with Saudi Arabia even as investors distance themselves after the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Above, a Saudi investment conference in Riyadh last month. • Since President Trump took office, there has been a sharp decline in financial penalties against banks and big companies accused of malpractice, a Times investigation found. • Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, bought back nearly $1 billion of its own stock during its blockbuster third quarter. • Apple's decision to limit disclosures — including how many iPhones, iPads and Macs it sells each quarter — and its disappointing forecast for fourth-quarter sales dragged down its stock. • Coming this week: BMW will publish its third-quarter earnings, and E.U. foreign ministers will meet to discuss trade relations with the U.S. and how to modernize the World Trade Organization. •  Here's a snapshot of global markets. • The London police are investigating accusations that some members of Britain's opposition Labour Party posted anti-Semitic threats online.

Mary Keitany of Kenya won the women's race for the fourth time, finishing in 2:22:48. In the wheelchair division, Daniel Romanchuk of the U.S. upset the defending men's champion, Marcel Hug of Switzerland, by one second in 1:36:21. Manuela Schar of Switzerland defended her title in the women's race in 1:50:27. • Novak Djokovic lost to Karen Khachanov of Russia in the final of the Paris Masters tennis tournament, ending a 22-match winning streak. • In memoriam: Judith Kazantzis, 78, the British feminist poet and activist. She once said she ""began to write to remedy the despair of a young housebound mother."" Stickers can be surprisingly motivating, even for adults. At least that's the idea behind the ""I Voted"" stickers handed out at polling stations in the U.S. — that they'll encourage voters to turn out, and inspire those who see them to vote themselves. (Election Day is Tuesday.) The stickers first appeared in the 1980s, offered by businesses, unions and civic groups. State and local governments began making their own. While some states keep it simple, others take the opportunity to express their identities. Some stickers, like Alabama's, Ohio's and Tennessee's, incorporate the shape of the state. Georgia's use the state's famous peach, while California's is in 13 languages. Alaskans who voted early this year got stickers with cartoon versions of state animals. Louisiana's stickers, which feature the Cajun artist George Rodrigue's iconic ""Blue Dog,"" have appeared on eBay. New York City has its own subway-themed sticker. Other cities are following Chicago's lead and offering wristbands instead. The stickers have also gone online. Instagram has ""I Voted"" and ""Yo Voté"" emblems, along with a ""We Voted"" story on Election Day that gathers posts by a user's friends. Do they actually make a difference? One study found that in 2010, Facebook's ""I Voted"" button drove 340,000 Americans to the polls. But either way, you still get a sticker.

News,2018-11-05,"Spiders like Ralph Waldo Emerson’s face. They have built a sprawling, spreading web in his left eye.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/nyregion/hall-of-fame-bronx-sculptures.html,1319," Spiders like Ralph Waldo Emerson's face. They have built a sprawling, spreading web in his left eye. That is not the only problem at something called the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, which a preservation-minded group is putting on its annual list of ""at-risk landscapes."" The group, the Cultural Landscape Foundation, says ""water damage, pollutants and the effects of weathering"" have taken a toll on the century-old structure, on the campus of what is now Bronx Community College. Perhaps it is surprising that there is even a hall of fame in the Bronx. There is a reason: The campus was built by New York University as the country was sailing toward the 20th century. It was a time of big ideas and big ideals. The Hall of Fame for Great Americans was created to celebrate those who had thought them or had held them dear, and to do so in a singularly American way. To get into the Hall, someone had to be elected. But the Hall's last election was held in 1970s. The busts of the four people chosen were, as far as anyone knows, never commissioned. The Hall of Fame, which is more of a semicircle than a hall, is an open-air gallery of statues of important Americans — or, at least, Americans who were considered important when they were chosen. And so Abraham Lincoln is across from Thomas Jefferson, which is just around a corner from George Washington. Booker T. Washington is four over from Susan B. Anthony, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wrote ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" the novel that stirred the abolitionist movement nationwide, is close by. Two were evicted last year. The statues of Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee were taken down after the clashes in Charlottesville, Va., fomented by white nationalists opposed to the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue there. The Hall of Fame's Lee had stood next to its Ulysses S. Grant for decades. Others are head-scratchers that would challenge a ""Jeopardy!"" contestant. Sylvanus Thayer? William Thomas Green Morton? Edwin Booth? Still others were the work of artists who were themselves famous. The Emerson was signed by Daniel Chester French, better known for the huge, seated Lincoln statue in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. The Lincoln in the Hall of Fame was the work of Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The Saint-Gaudens is a few steps back. Yes, there is a Saint-Gaudens in the Hall of Fame, because he was once that well known. Among many other works, Saint-Gaudens did the gleaming statue of Gen. William T. Sherman in Grand Army Plaza, at the Fifth Avenue end of Central Park. The Hall of Fame has genius inventors and generals and tunesmiths, as well as Walt Whitman, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Sidney Lanier. The Wright Brothers, Wilbur and Orville, are across from Thomas A. Edison and one over from the pioneering peanut researcher George Washington Carver, who is next to Thomas Paine. Common sense would suggest that there was no other place to put Paine, the colonial-era patriot who wrote the anti-British pamphlet ""Common Sense."" For generations, the Hall drew tourists ""like an urban Mount Rushmore,"" as well as national news coverage about who was voted in. But when Michael T. Kaufman wrote those words in The New York Times 25 years ago, he added that the Hall had ""outlived its glory, its proverbial 15 minutes."" Today, safe to say, many of the millions of annual visitors to New York — and even many New Yorkers themselves — have never heard of the place. If the Hall once reflected who's who, it has become a snapshot of who was who. Charles A. Birnbaum, the executive director of the Cultural Landscape Foundation, called the Hall a tribute to ""the changing nature of fame itself."" ""That's one of the reasons it has to endure,"" he said. ""That conversation is still going on."" The Hall is all about national identity, he added, and is ""incredibly relevant, given the national debate we're having about national greatness, national identity, how broad is that, how deep is that."" ""This was one of the touchstones of defining what American identity was."" So, the Hall was a product of a different America, in a different city, on a different campus. N.Y.U., in financial trouble in the 1970s, packed up and left, consolidating its operations around Washington Square. New York State helped out by arranging for the City University of New York to buy the campus for $62 million and turn it over to Bronx Community College, a far different kind of institution. Minorities make up 96 percent of the students at Bronx Community, according to the website Community College Review, and the majority is Hispanic. But the Hall is short on minorities and women. The faces on the statues do not show it, but the Hall has more problems than Emerson's eye. The masonry is cracked in places and crumbling in others, and, as the foundation put it, ""Many statues have deep stains from biological contaminants."" That is a delicate way of referring to bird droppings. The foundation also warns that runoff from copper in the roof has discolored the bronze tablets below the statues. The template for the tablets was the work of Louis Comfort Tiffany, the Art Nouveau genius who was the first designated design director of the jewelry store his father had started. The foundation said the cost of repairs has been estimated at $12 million, too high a price for Bronx Community College. The most urgent work would cost $1.2 million, the foundation said. ""These repairs are beyond a public college's ability to afford,"" said Richard F. Ginsberg, an interim assistant vice president of Bronx Community, adding that less than 10 percent of the college's budget goes toward capital projects, a category that includes equipment for the classrooms, as well as utilities and maintenance. Mr. Ginsberg said Bronx Community has a foundation that hopes to raise money to preserve the Hall. The architect Samuel G. White, who is involved in efforts to evaluate and renovate the library adjacent to the Hall, said the Hall of Fame was ""an afterthought"" — and, speaking of afterthoughts, this is probably the moment to note that his great-grandfather designed the Hall, the library and the rest of the campus for N.Y.U. His great-grandfather was Stanford White, who was famous as an architect and infamous for an affair with a woman who later married a jealous industrialist named Harry K. Thaw. Thaw shot him to death in a building White had designed, Madison Square Garden. As for the Hall, Mr. White said the original plan called for a semicircular museum behind the library — ""a 19th-century cabinet of curiosities, with paintings and Indian arrowheads and a giant piece of coral they still have."" But the curved structure lacked something, he said, and his great-grandfather designed a colonnade on top of what was to be the museum. ""Somebody had to come up with a use for it, and they created the Hall of Fame,"" Mr. White said. It predated the other halls of fame. As Mr. White said, ""The one in Cooperstown wasn't created until the '30s."" Mr. White's real passion is not the Hall, but the library it surrounds. The library, largely empty since N.Y.U.'s departure, needs $44 million in work, Mr. Ginsberg said, citing the same analysis that provided the repair estimate for the Hall. Now, about Sylvanus Thayer. He was an early superintendent of the United States Military Academy whom American Heritage magazine described as ""the man who made West Point."" William Thomas Green Morton? He was a 19th-century dentist whom the Hall credits with being the first to use ether as a general anesthetic, in 1846. And Edwin Booth was an actor and a 19th-century celebrity whose younger brother, John Wilkes Booth, was Lincoln's assassin. In the Hall of Fame, the Booth is just steps from the Lincoln."
News,2018-11-05,"MONT-SAINT-GUIBERT, Belgium — The migrants while away their days in Brussels at Maximilian Park, near the busy Gare du Nord, playing soccer on the durable artificial grass, checking their smartphones, dodging the police and trying to find a way to Britain.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/world/europe/belgium-migrants-volunteers.html,1220," MONT-SAINT-GUIBERT, Belgium — The migrants while away their days in Brussels at Maximilian Park, near the busy Gare du Nord, playing soccer on the durable artificial grass, checking their smartphones, dodging the police and trying to find a way to Britain. Roxane Hauzeur, a designer for a fashion house, began volunteering to help them a year ago, working with a new organization that provides housing and other assistance for the migrants, most of them from Africa and seeking asylum. She found herself swept away, transported. Ms. Hauzeur started bringing food, then giving rides, but soon she was playing host to up to five people a night in her small Brussels apartment. The experience has transformed her, she said. ""It was like a tsunami in my life,"" she said. ""You come and meet these people and you realize they're just like you."" The latest refugee crisis, which peaked in 2015, brought hundreds of thousands of migrants to Europe. And though the numbers have dropped considerably, many in Belgium, as elsewhere in Europe, see the migrants, often young and male, as a threat. Ms. Hauzeur and her fellow volunteers at Citizen's Platform for the Support of Refugees, have a different view. ""I feel ashamed of my country,"" she said. ""I heard so many times that Europe is the land of human rights, but it's not true."" Citizen's Platform was the idea of Mehdi Kassou, a 35-year-old Belgian of Moroccan ancestry who left his job with a Korean company to found the group. Roughly 7,000 Belgians volunteer there to help migrants and asylum seekers. When Mr. Kassou walks through the park, he is greeted like a rock star. He gets warm hellos, fist bumps and conversation in French and the various Arabic dialects he is trying to learn. The migrants who come to Belgium see it as their best way to slip into Britain. But they face a variety of legal complications. Under the current rules of the European Union, migrants are supposed to register and seek asylum where they first land. But hoping to move onward, they don't want to register in Belgium, or having already been registered where they landed, in Italy, Greece or Spain, they don't want to be sent back. And they have more basic needs. ""We now house about 650 people a night,"" Mr. Kassou said, 300 in a building the group got permission to use last December, serviced by some 15 employees. The rest are housed by volunteers. Mr. Kassou urges those most likely to qualify for political asylum to apply in Belgium; those who are rejected often appeal. The government estimates that only a few thousand illegal migrants are here now, and that just a few hundred roam Maximilian Park. Officially, the number of asylum seekers in Belgium in 2017 was 19,688, down from 44,760 in 2015. Asylum is granted to fewer than half of those who apply, Mr. Kassou said, but more easily to those from Syria, Eritrea and other areas torn by violence. Jails and detention centers are full, and the government is exploring renting a 300-bed prison boat from the Dutch. Some volunteers say the experience of meeting the migrants, and feeding and helping house them, has altered their own lives. Ms. Hauzeur's grandmother is from Congo; her father is half-Congolese and came to Belgium at the age of 4. Both are proud of her for her volunteer work, she said, ""even if my grandmother is jealous that I know more now about Ethiopia and Sudan than the Congo."" Another volunteer, Anne-Catherine de Neve, 45; her husband, Yves Hallet, 46; and their three children take in four to six migrants a night, five or six nights a week. One recent night, at their modest home here about 40 minutes' drive southeast of Maximilian Park, they sat down with their migrant guests to a dinner of chicken and rice. ""I want to fight against all the fascism we're seeing,"" Ms. de Neve said as she cooked. ""It's a fight for social rights, and it's quite a fight for Belgium, for Europe, for all countries."" Ms. de Neve read about the migrants in the park in the news and started volunteering a year ago. She takes in the migrants in part, she said, to educate her children. ""Now they hear, they see, and they understand something, but I think they'll have a better understanding later."" At first, she said, her oldest son, Robin, now 16, wanted to have nothing to do with the migrants. Then one day, she said, ""he called me in the park and asked: 'How many tonight? I'll make up the beds.'"" Ms. de Neve has learned something about herself, too. ""Before I would tell myself I wasn't racist,"" she said. ""It's easy to tell yourself that. Being around these migrants in my house I learned a lot about them, and about my own views."" Her husband said he had been nervous at first, even afraid. ""I worried about my children and hid my laptop,"" he recalled. No longer. ""We've lost maybe 20 euros and some headphones,"" Mr. de Neve said of the past year. ""They are very good people."" He prefers not to name his employer, but said, ""We decided that if we do nothing, then we will be responsible for what happens."" Charity has, however, created a financial strain. It has been hard for the couple to pay school fees for their own children. So they collect extra and unused food from shops and restaurants to help with the 28 or so dinners they provide every week. ""We're completely out of money,"" Ms. de Neve said, laughing. ""We'll figure it out later."" One of her guests on a recent night was a Libyan migrant named Maamar Isneebir, who is known as Omar. Now 18, Mr. Isneebir left his home in Khoms, a coastal city east of Tripoli, a year ago. He claims that when he was 11, he fought against the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. ""There is no safety now,"" he said. ""There are militias, there is ISIS."" There is also little work. Mr. Isneebir spent three days at sea, terrified, before reaching Italy, where he was registered. He then made his way to Nice, then Paris, and then to Germany for eight months. The Germans told him to return to France, and when the police came to arrest him, he said, he jumped from a window and made his way to Belgium five months ago. He had hoped to go to Britain, but now says he'd like to stay. ""It's unbelievable to have someone open their house to someone they don't know,"" Mr. Isneebir said in Arabic, translated by Mr. Kassou, who noted quietly that Libyans have only a 20 percent chance of getting political asylum here. ""They treat me like their own child."" Also at the de Neve home that night was Said Adam, 18. He comes from Darfur, and has been in Belgium nearly 10 months, he said. When Mr. Adam came to Italy by boat, he said, ""I didn't know where Belgium is."" Now, he, too, hopes to stay — though he still seems a little lost. Ms. de Neve has few illusions about how much she can do for her guests. ""I cannot help them, really,"" she said simply. ""The rules are made for them to lose."""
News,2018-11-05,The chief executive of the SoftBank Group of Japan denounced the killing of a prominent dissident in a Saudi consulate in Turkey — but said he would not cut ties with the Saudi Arabian government.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/business/softbank-son-saudi-arabia-khashoggi.html,800," The chief executive of the SoftBank Group of Japan denounced the killing of a prominent dissident in a Saudi consulate in Turkey — but said he would not cut ties with the Saudi Arabian government. The remarks by the SoftBank chief, Masayoshi Son, on Monday were his first public comments on the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who entered the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and never emerged. Turkey has said Mr. Khashoggi was beaten and tortured before being beheaded and dismembered. But Mr. Son's comments also highlight a basic fact: Despite the outrage directed at Saudi Arabia over the killing, big companies are unwilling to cut off the kingdom as a lucrative client. More than a dozen business leaders — from Mr. Son to Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase to Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber — canceled plans to attend a major Saudi business conference last month, in what was meant as a rebuke to the Saudi government. (Mr. Dimon later said that while his firm ""couldn't be seen in any way condoning"" any Saudi officials' involvement in Mr. Khashoggi's death, he acknowledged that pulling out of the gathering accomplished ""nothing."") Few companies seriously contemplated severing their contracts with Saudi clients, however. At The New York Times's DealBook conference last week, Laurence D. Fink of the investment management giant BlackRock said that it was a ""hard decision"" to withdraw from the Saudi conference. But he unapologetically defended keeping the Saudi government as a client, saying that doing business there was ""not something I'm ashamed of."" At issue are the billions of dollars that Saudi Arabia has spread around the corporate world. The country has pledged to buy nearly $110 billion worth of arms from the United States, though so far it has spent only a fraction of that. Business from Saudi Arabia constitutes at least 15 percent of the revenue of BAE Systems, the British defense contractor. And consulting firms have courted the Saudi government for years, earning hundreds of millions in fees — to the point that the country's planning ministry has been nicknamed the ""Ministry of McKinsey."" For SoftBank in particular, Saudi Arabia is a crucial part of its future. The company, a Japanese internet, energy and financial conglomerate, has increasingly staked its future on its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund. The biggest technology investment firm in the world, the Vision Fund owns stakes in Uber, the co-working space provider WeWork and more. The success of the Vision Fund has bolstered its parent's earnings. SoftBank on Monday reported a second-quarter profit of 526.4 billion yen, or $4.6 billion, up fivefold from the same time a year ago, thanks to the Vision Fund's sale of its stake in the Indian e-commerce company Flipkart to Walmart. Mr. Son said on Monday that he predicted the Vision Fund to propel even more growth at SoftBank. ""Next year, we will far exceed the scale we are seeing this year and maybe a scale that Japanese economy has never experienced before,"" he told analysts. But none of the Vision Fund's success would have been possible without the Saudis, who pledged $45 billion toward the fund. The country's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who led the investment in the Vision Fund — and who is suspected of being involved in Mr. Khashoggi's death — told Bloomberg News last month that, without his country, ""there will be no SoftBank Vision Fund."" Indeed, Mr. Son hopes to raise another Vision Fund, and it would be unclear whether that is possible without the Saudis' backing. Mr. Son said on Monday that he had raised his concerns about Mr. Khashoggi's killing with Prince Mohammed and other senior Saudi officials, asking for ""further clarity on this tragic case."" ""They said they are taking this very seriously,"" Mr. Son said. But he made it clear that he would not abandon his business interests in Saudi Arabia. ""We want to see those responsible held accountable,"" Mr. Son said during a news conference at his company's earnings presentation in Tokyo. ""At the same time, we have also accepted responsibility to the people of Saudi Arabia, an obligation we take quite seriously to help them manage their financial resources and diversify their economy."" ""As horrible as this event was, we cannot turn our backs on the Saudi people, as we work to help them in their continued efforts to reform and modernize their society,"" he said. Mr. Son said companies have not refused to accept money from his fund because of Mr. Khashoggi's killing. He said ""there are complicated issues"" in the relationships between the United States and Saudi Arabia as well as between Japan and Saudi Arabia. He added that ""as a businessman, I believe I should not be involved in the political side of such a case."""

For the rest of the list, click here.) FREDERICK DOUGLASS Prophet of Freedom By David W. Blight Illustrated. 888 pp. Simon & Schuster. $37.50. The alchemy that transformed an unknown fugitive slave named Frederick Douglass into one of the most celebrated orators and political theorists in the world finished its work with astonishing speed. Douglass was just 20 years old when, on Sept. 3, 1838, he dressed up as a sailor and stole out of Baltimore carrying borrowed freedom documents. He and his wife — a free black Marylander who had aided the escape — fled to New Bedford, Mass., where Douglass was recruited to the abolitionist movement while honing his oratory at a local church. As the historian David W. Blight shows in his cinematic and deeply engaging ""Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom,"" white abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison were smitten with Douglass, instantly recognizing the value of a recruit just out of chains whose eloquence refuted the claim that Negroes were inferior and who could condemn slavery as immoral by drawing on America's founding documents as well as his own bitter experience under the lash. It could not have been lost on the dapper, self-regarding Douglass that men and women swooned over him, describing him in terms that bordered on erotic. Garrison himself went starry-eyed, declaring that God had authored the young man's soul ""but a little lower than the angels."" Enraptured by the young orator in 1841, a white New England newspaper editor wrote: ""As this Douglass stood there in manly attitude, with erect form, and glistening eye and deep-toned voice, telling us that he had been secretly devising means to effect his release, we could not help thinking of Spartacus, the Gladiator."" The activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton saw him a year later at Boston's Faneuil Hall and spoke for many white women when she wrote: ""He stood there like an African prince, conscious of his dignity and power, grand in his physical proportions, majestic in his wrath, as with keen wit, satire and indignation he portrayed the bitterness of slavery."" Douglass became a marathon traveler for the abolitionist cause at a time when moving about the country by train was punishing in itself. Racist conductors worsened the ordeal by exiling him to ""mean, dirty and uncomfortable"" Negro cars or ejected him from the train altogether. Adoring crowds at some stops alternated with mobs like the one in Indiana that cried ""kill the nigger"" while beating Douglass unconscious and breaking his right hand. The itinerant orator was just seven years out of chains — and already the equivalent of a modern-day rock star — when the first of his three memoirs, ""Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave,"" made him the most well-known Negro on the globe. [ What America owes Frederick Douglass: Read David W. Blight's Op-Ed essay. ] Dependent upon abolitionist charity for his family's daily bread, Douglass nonetheless chafed under a stifling Garrisonian orthodoxy that required adherents to embrace pacifism and abstain from politics. He charted a course away from all that by starting his own newspaper and openly embracing as household saints blood-drenched figures like the slave-rebellion leader Nat Turner and the white revolutionary John Brown, both of whom he classed with the founders. His fledgling newspaper, The North Star, served as the school where he sharpened his grasp of politics and developed a penetrating style as an editorialist. By the time Abraham Lincoln was elected in 1860, Douglass understood full well that slavery could be purged from the United States only with blood — as his friend John Brown had put it on the way to the gallows — and launched blistering attacks on those who sought to compromise with the institution rather than obliterate it. Douglass thought comparatively little of Lincoln at first — describing him as ""honest"" but without claim to ""any literary culture beyond the circle of his practical duties"" — and breathed fire when Lincoln used the first-ever presidential meeting with African-Americans to promote a racist plan for colonizing Negroes outside of the country. As the Civil War raged toward conclusion, Douglass attacked Lincoln for vacillating on black rights in the South. Wounded, the president summoned him to the White House and sought his help with the war effort. By this point, the man who had slipped out of Baltimore with borrowed freedom papers was poised to play a central role in America's postwar transformation. The novelist William Burroughs once complained about autobiographers who conceal their lives in print, quipping that the Paul Bowles memoir ""Without Stopping"" would have been better titled ""Without Telling."" Blight makes a similar case against Douglass, who shrouded his domestic life in secrecy even as he wrote and rewrote his personal story in three widely read autobiographies that totaled more than 1,200 pages. ""Douglass invited us into his life over and over,"" Blight writes, ""and it is a rich literary and historical feast to read the music of Douglass's words. But as he sits majestically at the head of the table, it is as if he slips out of the room right when we so wish to know more — anything — about his more private thoughts, motivations and memories of the many conflicts in his personal life."" Douglass cultivated the fiction that he was ""self-made"" and had sprung fully formed from his own forehead. Blight dismantles this pretense in a tour de force of storytelling and analysis, showing that the young orator-to-be had benefited from a great deal of mentorship and good fortune. Viewed through this lens, the fabled escape from slavery takes on different contours. The slave master's decision not to sell the rebellious young Fred into a living death in the Deep South — and instead to consign him to the custody of a brother in Baltimore — can be credibly seen as an act of familial grace by a slave owner toward a half-white member of his extended family. Among those in the free black community of Baltimore who embraced Fred and propelled him toward freedom was his wife-to-be, the housekeeper Anna Murray. Blight draws on new archival material and insights gleaned from a lifetime in the company of his subject to shed light on the orator's complex relationship with his wife, Anna, and the two white women who came between the couple within the walls of the Douglass family home in Rochester. The great man's vocation as a wandering oracle was possible because Anna, who bore five children (only four lived to adulthood), ran the household with a sure hand, hosting fugitive slaves, far-flung relatives and others who turned up at the front door in need. Anna, whom Blight describes as ""largely illiterate,"" could be of little help with her husband's journalism. For that, the charismatic orator called up the British abolitionist Julia Griffiths, who put aside her life and moved in 1849 to be with him in Rochester and to get The North Star off the ground. She enabled Douglass to survive personally and professionally, managing and raising money for the newspaper and for the food that came across the Douglass family table. She helped ""to polish a raw genius into a gem and, for a time, managed his emotional health as well as his bank accounts."" Together with her sister, Eliza, Griffiths relieved the Douglasses of an enormous financial burden by purchasing the mortgage of the family home. White Rochester was scandalized when Griffiths moved into the Douglass home, an arrangement that spawned rumors of a romantic link between patron and orator. It is alleged that she moved out when Anna ""ordered it."" That Griffiths loved Douglass is clear on the face of things, but any claim that the two carried on a sexual relationship right under Anna's nose seems far-fetched. The eccentric German intellectual Ottilie Assing was another matter. She wandered into the Douglasses' lives in 1856, seeking permission to translate his second autobiography, ""My Bondage and My Freedom,"" into German. She remained in the family orbit for nearly three decades, serving as confidante and interlocutor — and lover. Douglass frequented her rooms in Hoboken, N.J., where the participants of her salon lionized him, validating his rise from slavery into the thinking classes. Assing shielded him when he was on the run from conspiracy charges in connection with John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, when he came within a hairbreadth of being captured and marched to the gallows with his revolutionary friend. That Assing was obsessed with the famous orator would have been readily apparent to Anna during the interloper's frequent intrusion on the family home, where she lived for months at a time. We know nothing of Anna's feelings on the matter — but the triangle of Frederick, Anna and the love-struck Ottilie comes through like the plot of an Edith Wharton novel. At different points, Assing referred to Anna as a ""veritable beast"" who kept her from her beloved Frederick, and as the ""border state"" that prevented her from advancing toward her heart's true goal. As Blight writes, ""Although Assing sipped tea occasionally with Mrs. Douglass, she held Anna in utter contempt, disrespecting her lack of education and even at times privately denigrating her role as homemaker."" The amorous German lingered in Douglass's circle year after year, waiting in vain for the divorce that would allow her to ""walk tall as the rightful 'Mrs. Douglass.'"" By the time Anna died in 1882, Assing was bitterly aware that the aging orator intended to marry Helen Pitts, a well-educated white woman in her 40s, who worked for Douglass in the recorder of deeds office in Washington. The nearly 66-year-old Douglass held the plan secret even from his children, with whom he also worked daily, and who seem to have learned of the marriage from press inquiries. He failed to notify his faithful British friend Julia, who received the news secondhand from friends in Rochester. Gracious as usual, she wished the newlyweds well and hoped that the union would give him ""true happiness"" in the evening of his days. Later that year, Assing killed herself in a Paris park — drinking potassium cyanide — leaving her beloved a tidy sum in her will."

The company had come to Los Angeles to dance in the Olympic Arts Festival, and my parents volunteered to host a post-performance dinner in our backyard. I recall about 200 people — family friends, Olympic officials and maybe 25 dancers — eating curry (is that right?) off paper plates. But that's not what this is about. No, this is about the ballerino — my word for him — I met and what he represented to a lonely gay kid in Southern California in 1984, a kid who had never before met another gay person. Earlier that evening, I had seen the dancer turn, leap and smile onstage, expressing through the mute language of ballet who he was. Something about his movement told me he was gay, and I felt he was dancing not only for himself but for me. Onstage, the ballerino wore brown tights that showed the trunks of his thighs, and everything else. Now he was in loose linen pants with a drawstring belt and an open collar that exposed the rod of his clavicle. He said hello. I could barely speak. He might have said, ""Lovely party,"" but that was it, he was on his way. The isolation of my queer youth was about to return. Out of nowhere, I told him he was my favorite ballet dancer in the world. He seemed startled, and a little embarrassed, but he came to understand what I was trying to say: ""If you need someone to talk to, you can write me, care of the Ballet."" The next day, I rode my bike to the library and looked up the address in Winnipeg and sent a letter trying to express something about myself I had never expressed before. Two months later, he wrote back, apologizing: He'd been on tour. Although time has devoured that sheet of paper, I still remember the gentle message embedded in his words: One day, you too will find yourself. On a muggy afternoon in Harlem, Preston Chamblee, 23, a member of New York City Ballet since 2015, says to me, ""I hope to be part of a generation that can change the boundaries of what ballet can do, a generation that says we're going to represent everyone, not just the stories that have been told before."" We're looking at a Facebook video of Chamblee and his fellow company member Taylor Stanley, 27, in a romantic pas de deux in the choreographer Lauren Lovette's ""Not Our Fate."" The ballet depicts a love story between two men of color not as subtext but as central narrative. When it premiered last fall at New York's David H. Koch Theater, it sent a jolt of relevance through an art form that often feels mired in another era. It's a thrilling duet, both men in white T-shirts and black pants moving toward and away from each other, embracing and rejecting and succumbing to desire and love. Rather than putting a man into a woman's role, Lovette choreographed the piece for two men; the audience can see the dancers negotiating their positions, just as queer couples negotiate theirs. (I showed the clip to a gay friend, who said, ""That basically sums up my relationship with my boyfriend."") Men have danced together before in ballet, typically in expressions of friendship or rivalry, such as the death duet between Tybalt and Mercutio in ""Romeo and Juliet,"" first choreographed in Czechoslovakia by Ivo Vana Psota in 1938. We've seen choreographers invert genders, often casting men as Cinderella's evil stepsisters for a laugh. Yet Chamblee had never performed a pas de deux explicitly depicting two men in love. Shortly after ""Not Our Fate"" premiered, Justin Peck, City Ballet's resident choreographer, further challenged ballet's gender norms when he adapted the woman's role in the pas de deux at the heart of his 2017 ""The Times Are Racing,"" pairing Stanley with Daniel Applebaum, a 32-year-old gay soloist with the company. If you didn't know much about classical ballet, you might think it's an obvious home for queer artists and narratives, but it's more complicated than that: Ballet, of course, has always had gay dancers and choreographers and homoeroticism, but it's an artistic discipline shaped by tradition. The canon is small; the institutions are formal and steeped in history; and the masters who cast the principal male roles — Romeo, Don Quixote, Prince Siegfried in ""Swan Lake"" — sometimes select dancers who embody the conventional male hero, onstage and off. To have a public queer identity, or to be perceived as too effeminate, can still affect a dancer's ability to land these lead roles. It's one of ballet's ironies — the outside world has long viewed the male dancer as the antithesis of conventional masculinity, yet the culture inside ballet can still be somewhat bro-y. (A recent lawsuit by a female dancer against City Ballet, three of its former male principals and a financial donor, who were accused of sharing sexually explicit images of female dancers, cites the company's ""fraternity-like atmosphere,"" which City Ballet denies.) This is one reason ""Not Our Fate"" means so much to Chamblee. For the first time, he says, ""I really got to be absolutely nobody but myself onstage."" Chamblee is part of a new generation of dancers who are collapsing the boundaries between queerness and maleness in ballet by challenging its, and the culture's, preconceived ideas of masculinity. They use social media, especially Instagram, to express themselves creatively and corporeally, building an audience much larger than what a company alone can bring them. Their work onstage and online rejects the idea that a male dancer must store his queerness in his locker. They see no contradiction in the serious artist who dances on ballet's largest stages and also posts videos of himself, say, dancing on a treadmill in platform heels. In doing so, these dancers are taking some of the starch out of ballet. Last June, London's Royal Ballet hung the rainbow flag outside its historic home for the first time. For Marcelino Sambé, 24, a soloist at the company, ""it tells everyone it's an open institution. Come on in.""  13 Photos View Slide Show › There's a hashtag for everything on Instagram; when you type #gayballet, you will come across men in tights and training shorts, and eventually you might find James Whiteside, most likely bare-chested with a large scratch tattooed on his ribs. Whiteside, 34, is a principal dancer with New York's American Ballet Theater and, since joining the company in 2012, one of its major stars; critics applaud his power and energy and the depth he brings to his characters. For the choreographer Lar Lubovitch's 2015 production of ""Othello,"" Whiteside didn't want to waste the opportunity of working with a gay collaborator — his Iago was infused with what he calls ""queer rage."" This month, at New York's Joyce Theater, Whiteside opened the celebrated choreographer Arthur Pita's new ballet, ""The Tenant,"" based on Roland Topor's 1964 French novel and Roman Polanski's film adaptation of the same name, which questions ideas of identity and gender. ""My personality was maybe something that ABT hadn't encountered before,"" Whiteside says. ""I would come in 'yaass kween'-ing everyone and doing drag queen walks, and that could have been so easily misconstrued as not taking the work seriously."" But Whiteside takes his work very seriously because he doesn't want to, as he puts it, go back. Back to his late teens in South Boston when people regularly threw rocks at him and called him the F-word on his way to and from Boston Ballet. ""I found myself a target anywhere I went,"" he says. Like anyone who's danced through fire and come out burnished, Whiteside can now laugh at his past and turn it into a personal statement and meta joke on Instagram. In one post, he's flexing his biceps while wearing a pink bandanna, a black tutu and a tank top that says ""Milk's Gym"" (Milk is the drag name of his boyfriend, Daniel Donigan, who appeared on two seasons of ""RuPaul's Drag Race""). Whiteside's caption: ""Masc femme butch kween horse peasant monarch wealthy broke realness."" Then a shrugging-guy emoji. What he hears most from his 171,000 Instagram followers is that he looks like he's having fun. And he is. Dancing with ABT has been his dream since he was a boy, when he attended a gala and visited the principals' red-velvet hallway backstage. He loves ballet and wants others to fall in love with it, too, and he hopes his feed will bring more people into the theater. But it bugs him that so much of ballet Instagram — his own at times, too — is ""dancer thirst trap."" The twerking and the tights and the belts are a misleading representation of the work, the almost inhuman physical effort behind a dancer doing splits in the air. ""No one's going to understand what we really do from Instagram, where everything has a smile on it and a cigarette in its mouth,"" he says. ""Ballet is one of the most physically demanding things in the world, but you have to seem like you're just taking a whiz."" Whiteside has a point. But like any protagonist, he can't see himself as we do. Before social media, ballet on video — think of those tame PBS broadcasts — appealed to a specialized audience. One reason is its perspective: The cameras, way up in the auditorium, show ballet from a limited point of view. But on Instagram, the close-up angles, taped ankles, the veins and arteries flooded with blood, give us ballet as the dancer experiences it. Rather than removing the magic of a darkened theater, this intimacy brings us closer to the my-God-how-does-the-human-body-do-that awe that ballet inspires. In one post, we see Whiteside's backside, naked but for the straps of a well-worn dance belt. But this isn't just a thirst trap. It's a hard, strangely shaped, almost gnarled piece of flesh. The caption — ""Dancer butt"" — tells us we're looking at decades of sacrifice knotted up in muscle and skin. It shows us the feat behind the art, reminding us that the foundation of dance is physical strength — a quality associated with traditional masculinity. Whiteside is an athlete-artist restless with ideas and energy, and Instagram gives him a space arguably bigger than a company's stage to experiment with what it now means to be a great dancer. Harper Watters, 26, is many things: acclaimed Houston Ballet soloist; son of two former college professors; host of a backstage chat show called ""The Pre Show"" on his YouTube channel; a black gay man from New Hampshire now living in Texas; a lean, inventive artist who dances with the freedom that comes from knowing who you are; a devourer of pop culture. On his website, he calls himself the Wendy Williams of ballet. When I talk to him, he elaborates: ""If Wendy Williams and Beyoncé had a love child who they put in ballet, it would 100 percent be me."" In one episode of ""The Pre Show,"" filmed behind the scenes of a performance of ""Swan Lake"" in Minneapolis, he and his fellow dancer Hayden Stark sit at the mirror applying their characters' makeup while talking about college, sex, queer persecution in Russia and facial hair. In many ways, this could be a live-stream of two young gay men getting ready for a night out at the bars, but over the course of the 16.5-minute segment, the dancers transform into their ballet roles. Dressed as a swan hunter, Watters talks to the camera in a butch tone and says he and Stark are about to go out and do ""boy things"" like seducing women and fighting, but then they laugh and return to their natural voices — distinctly, unapologetically gay — and clarify, ""a different kind of boy thing."" If ballet feels remote to many, especially younger people, this type of access and authenticity connects the medium to today's cultural currents. Watters says he's influenced as much by classical ballet as by reality television, including ""America's Next Top Model"" and ""RuPaul's Drag Race."" He's faced some backlash online about how he ""represents"" the Houston Ballet, which he joined as an apprentice in 2011, but that criticism seems out of step with what the word ""representation"" now means in our culture. ""The Pre Show"" is ostensibly about a dancer preparing for his roles, but its subtext is stereotypes — an artist owning, defying and subverting them as part of the process of becoming himself. Two years ago, before his promotion to demisoloist, a director taught Watters an important lesson: Ballet isn't really about how high your legs can go or how many turns you can do, but what you're trying to say about yourself and the world. Every step has to have intention. As a ballet student in Sweden, the dancer Pontus Lidberg, 41, had a hypermasculine, almost cartoonish notion of what a ballerino should be — the guy who pulls up to the theater on a motorcycle, muscles his way through ""Quixote"" and caps off the evening with a ballerina. This was the dominant narrative in the 1990s, when only a few male dancers were openly gay. He sees it as part of the aftermath of the AIDS epidemic that killed so many artists, including, in 1993, ballet's global celebrity, Rudolf Nureyev, who cracked the door to his closet but never fully emerged from it. ""I had no role models,"" Lidberg says. ""I had to create that myself."" Lidberg has since become a leading choreographer around the world, developing works for companies such as City Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet. In his latest piece, ""Siren,"" performed in October at the Joyce, he flips the genders in Homer's ""Odyssey."" Ulysses is a woman, and the sirens — the original temptations — are men. Its central theme is that existential desire to connect. Like the dancers he mentors, Lidberg is part of a cohort of choreographers (some of whom are straight) expanding ballet by telling new stories, which includes Peck, Lovette and Joshua Beamish, whose 2015 piece ""Burrow"" depicts the arc of a relationship between two men, set to the music of the 20th-century Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Last year, the Russian choreographer Yuri Possokhov's ballet for Moscow's Bolshoi Theater, based on the life of Nureyev, was postponed two days before its world premiere. The authorities arrested its director on suspicion of embezzling government funds, although many suspect the ballet's frankness about its subject's sexuality might have been the real issue. ""Nureyev"" opened five months later. (Possokhov declined to comment for this story.) Watching ballet is ultimately ephemeral — ""an experience that can never be relived,"" Lidberg says. So, too, is the body, especially the dancer's. ""Aging is very real, and for the dancer, it happens very quickly."" Rather than lamenting this, he embraces it, filming his work and releasing it on social media. In his 2007 ballet film, ""The Rain,"" he dances a pas de deux with a close male friend in a downpour to Doris Day's ""Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps"" (1965). ""My identity as a gay man has many layers,"" Lidberg adds. He also tries to convey something he rarely sees in ballet — not just sexuality, but companionship and tenderness between men. In other words, love. ""I am a ballerina,"" says Chase Johnsey. ""That's what I've done my whole career."" Johnsey, 33, danced principal female roles en pointe for more than a decade with Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, the all-male ballet comedy, but he left the company at the end of last year, after he began to identify as gender fluid. Johnsey, who uses male pronouns, says he and others felt harassed because ""we don't live up to some masculine ideal of what a gay man is."" (Trockadero says Johnsey's claims were investigated and no evidence to support them was found.) Growing up in what he calls ""the swamps of Florida,"" Johnsey remembers watching the ballerinas in class and wanting nothing more than to dance like them. An essential part of queerness is fluidity — between identities, expectations, definitions and that word no one likes, labels. And what is dance if not fluid — in motion, in music, in the blend between physical and artistic? Ballet is most powerful when it is most fluid. So, too, is the dancer, when he, or she, or they, moves fluidly. A dancer must move between roles — now Romeo, now a prince, now a ruby — just as a queer person moves between roles, finding comfort and creativity in that movement. But classical ballet isn't fluid. It's rigid with custom and stiff with history. ""You have all these people who love the way it's been for 200 years,"" Johnsey says. Johnsey made history this past June by dancing in the female corps in ""The Sleeping Beauty"" with English National Ballet. His dream now: to play the lead, Odette, in a major company's production of ""Swan Lake,"" not as female but as gender fluid, which he defines as identifying as male in some contexts and female in others. He sees the artistic potential of bringing this to a character who transforms from swan to human and back. ""If art reflects the state of the world, then I'm in the right place at the right time,"" he says. It would seem that way: Lukas Dhont's movie ""Girl,"" about a 15-year-old transgender ballerina, is Belgium's much-lauded entry for the upcoming Academy Awards. And a revival of Matthew Bourne's now-legendary 1995 ""Swan Lake,"" which features all-male swans, will open next month in London. But since the final curtain at the London Coliseum, Johnsey's phone hasn't rung. He now mentors young transgender and gender-nonconforming dancers. ""I'll probably never dance leading roles again,"" he says, ""but I don't care because there are so many kids out there who contact me on Instagram who think they don't have a fighting chance. I can give them that."" Every dancer I spoke with has a story of how their art touched someone in unexpected ways, just as the ballerino from Winnipeg gave me something I could carry far into my future. Art is nothing if it does not connect, and these dancers are connecting with people who might previously have thought ballet could not, or would not, speak for them. Whiteside tells me about a letter he received from a woman who thinks her young son is gay. The boy loves to dance, the mother writes, and wants to be like Whiteside when he grows up. His classmates make fun of him for loving ballet, but the mother is proud of her son for staying resolute; seeing Whiteside become successful gives her hope as a parent. ""I wrote her back and said that was me — headstrong little effeminate gay kid,"" Whiteside says. He keeps the letter in his locker with his tights and his shoes, and when he thinks of it, he marvels: ""You have no idea what you're doing, and then someone's a little more O.K. because of what you did.""

Here's what you need to know: President Trump and candidates around the country spent the weekend making their final pitches to voters before Tuesday's midterm elections. Here's the latest. While Mr. Trump is not on the ballot, many view the elections as an opportunity to assess his leadership, and the results will affect the remainder of his term. • News analysis: Dozens of House races are exceptionally close, recent polls by The Times and Siena College show. As a result, modest shifts among undecided voters or a slightly higher turnout could yield significantly different outcomes. Democrats would have to flip 23 Republican-held seats to gain control of the chamber. • The Tip Sheet: Our daily analysis of the elections looks at where things stand. • In Georgia: Brian Kemp, the secretary of state and the Republican nominee for governor, said that Democrats were under investigation for allegedly trying to hack the state's voter registration files. Democrats called the inquiry a political stunt. As President Trump and his allies waged a fear-based campaign to drive Republican voters to the polls, far-right communities online have seen their once-fringe views given prominent support. ""I've seen white supremacists and extremists talk about these anti-Semitic and racist ideas for years,"" said Oren Segal, the director of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. ""But it was always in the corner. Now, you don't know where the mainstream starts and the fringe ends."" • Tracing a meme: In less than two weeks, the phrase ""jobs not mobs"" moved from the right-wing internet onto some of the most prominent political stages in the country. • Election misinformation: Two months ago, The Times asked readers to send in examples of election-related misinformation. Here's how they responded. • From the Magazine: White supremacists and other far-right extremists have killed far more people since Sept. 11, 2001, than any other category of domestic extremists. But U.S. counterterrorism strategy has ignored the rising danger. Oleg Deripaska has spent two decades trying to buy respect in the West. London has welcomed him; Washington hasn't, really. Suspected by the U.S. of having ties to organized crime, Mr. Deripaska is on a list of Russians who faced sanctions from the Trump administration as punishment for Russian interference in the 2016 election. • Coming decision: The administration is nearing a deadline next month for a final ruling on sanctions against Mr. Deripaska's companies. There are signs that he could escape them entirely. Brent Taylor, the mayor of North Ogden, Utah, told his constituents in January that he would go to Afghanistan to train an Afghan commando battalion. It was his fourth deployment. Major Taylor, 39, was killed on Saturday, apparently by one of the people he was there to help. He leaves behind a wife and seven children. His body is scheduled to arrive at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware this evening. • The Afghan war: Major Taylor's death was a reminder that there's no end in sight for the 17-year conflict. • After another strong jobs report, our chief economics correspondent looked at how the financial lives of the middle class have changed in the past two years. It's a mixed picture. • President Xi Jinping of China kicked off a major trade show in Shanghai today intended to show the country's appetite for foreign goods. Notably absent were the leaders of Britain, Germany, Japan and South Korea, and the U.S. didn't send an official delegation at all. • American sanctions on Iranian oil resumed this morning. It's one of the headlines to watch this week. • More than 250 antiquarian book dealers in 24 countries are pulling over a million books off an Amazon-owned site for a week after the site abruptly banned sellers from several nations. • U.S. stocks were down on Friday. Here's a snapshot of global markets today. Tips for a more fulfilling life. • Parents shouldn't spank their children, the American Academy of Pediatrics said today. It's the group's most strongly worded warning against corporal punishment. • Create a holiday table setting that avoids clichés. • Recipe of the day: Pack a lunch of farro salad with beets, their greens and feta. • Shabbat services across the U.S., the first since a gunman killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, drew people of all faiths. • A gunman with a history of misogyny and racism killed two women and injured five other people at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, Fla. He then killed himself. • The Los Angeles Rams lost their first game of the season, to the New Orleans Saints. Here are the highlights from Week 9 in the N.F.L. • A British man who spent five months at sea is believed to be the first person to swim around Britain. • ""The Walking Dead"" had an end-of-series feel in its latest episode. We spoke to Andrew Lincoln about it. (Spoilers, obviously.) • ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" overcame lackluster reviews to earn about $50 million and the top spot at the domestic box office. • A marathon in photographs The New York City Marathon on Sunday involved 50,000 runners, 12,000 volunteers and hundreds of thousands of spectators. Here's what it looked like. Mary Keitany of Kenya won the women's race for the fourth time, finishing in 2 hours 22 minutes 48 seconds. Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia won the men's race for the first time, in 2:05:59. • In memoriam Roy Hargrove, a virtuoso trumpeter, became a symbol of jazz's youthful renewal in the early 1990s, and established himself as one of the most respected musicians of his generation. He was 49. • Dancers, and shoes, of color Some ballet performers paint or dye shoes to match their skin color. But they soon might not have to. • Quotation of the day ""Hey, we're in politics. What did people think they were going to, a tea party?"" — Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader, on how she responds to members of her party who say they won't support her for speaker if Democrats win a majority of seats on Tuesday. • The Times, in other words Here's an image of today's front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. • What we're reading Jenna Wortham, a writer for The Times, recommends this piece from Guernica: ""What does it feel like when everything familiar disappears? This short story is technically science fiction, but it feels unnervingly close to reality."" Stickers can be surprisingly motivating, even for adults. That's the idea behind the ""I Voted"" stickers handed out at polling stations — that they'll encourage voters to turn out, and inspire those who see them to vote themselves. The stickers first appeared in the 1980s, offered by businesses, unions and civic groups. State and local governments began making their own. While some states keep them simple, others express their identities. Some stickers, like Alabama's, Ohio's and Tennessee's, incorporate the shape of the state. Georgia's include  a peach, while California's is in 13 languages. Alaskans who voted early this year got stickers with cartoon versions of state animals. Louisiana's stickers, which feature the Cajun artist George Rodrigue's ""Blue Dog,"" have appeared on eBay. New York City has a subway-themed sticker. Other cities are following Chicago's lead and offering wristbands instead. The stickers have also transformed online. Instagram has ""I Voted"" and ""Yo Voté"" emblems, along with a ""We Voted"" story on Election Day that gathers posts by a user's friends. Do they actually make a difference? One study found that in 2010, Facebook's ""I Voted"" button drove 340,000 Americans to the polls. Either way, you still get a sticker.

Op-Ed,2018-11-05,"The grass-roots organizers delivering petitions to San Francisco City Hall in the spring of 2016 wore their message on their chests: “The People vs. Big Soda.” Six months later, The People won; voters overwhelmingly passed a penny-per-ounce tax on sugary drinks, designed to combat rising rates of diabetes and obesity.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/opinion/california-ballot-initiatives-direct-democracy.html,1353," The grass-roots organizers delivering petitions to San Francisco City Hall in the spring of 2016 wore their message on their chests: ""The People vs. Big Soda."" Six months later, The People won; voters overwhelmingly passed a penny-per-ounce tax on sugary drinks, designed to combat rising rates of diabetes and obesity. For years, California state legislators had killed attempts to tax sugary beverages, beholden to an industry that donated millions to political campaigns. The success of the San Francisco soda tax, along with similar ballot measures in three other Bay Area cities, energized a national movement and spurred new drives to tax soda in municipalities around California. The campaigns drew on the legacy and spirit of Hiram Johnson, the governor who championed direct democracy and led California to adopt the initiative, referendum and recall. Just as Governor Johnson had delivered in 1911 on his promise to give people tools to break free from the monopoly of the Southern Pacific Railroad, a century later the people would circumvent the State Legislature by taking their fight against the soda industry directly to the voters. Then the soda industry fought back — using Hiram Johnson's favorite weapon. Early this year, the beverage industry spent more than $7 million gathering enough signatures to put an initiative on the ballot that would require a two-thirds vote to pass any local tax. Such a change would wreak havoc with municipal finances, and the specter gave the industry leverage to get what it really wanted: In June, the initiative was withdrawn, in exchange for a state law that bars local governments from imposing any new soda taxes through 2030. The high-stakes trade was the latest escalation in California's initiative-industrial complex, in which wealth and stealth often subvert the goals of Hiram Johnson's reforms. With enough money, almost anything can get on the California ballot. Over the last century, particularly the last four decades, initiatives have shaped nearly every facet of life in California. Ballot propositions, which can be amended only by another popular vote, have determined how property taxes are levied, the fate of bilingual education and even the size of chickens' cages (and thus the price of eggs). When Hiram Johnson took office, amid rampant corruption, the Southern Pacific Railroad held so much power it was known as the fourth branch of government. ""While I do not by any means believe the initiative, the referendum and the recall are the panacea for all our political ills,"" Governor Johnson said in his 1911 inaugural address, ""they do give to the electorate the power of action when desired, and they do place in the hands of the people the means by which they may protect themselves."" Today, those tools are expertly wielded by the moneyed interests whose power they were designed to counteract. California is one of 24 states that allow voters to initiate laws through the petition process. A proposed law can be placed on the ballot with signatures equal to 5 percent of the total gubernatorial vote in the last election; a constitutional amendment requires 8 percent. In 1912, measures qualified with 30,857 signatures; by the 21st century, the number topped half a million. In the early decades, only a handful of initiatives reached the ballot. By the 1930s, the nation's first political consultants, Clem Whitaker and Leone Baxter, began to carve out a niche business, handling 65 initiative campaigns over 15 years.  Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Baxter, and the political-consultant industry they spawned, fueled a rapid growth in initiatives by the 1970s. Paid signature gatherers driven by financial incentive rather than moral conviction replaced volunteers who had once circulated petitions for their causes. The initiative ""is very rapidly becoming a tool of the special interests,"" Jerry Brown, then the secretary of state, testified at a 1972 state hearing where signature gatherers detailed a range of deceptive practices. The last initiative that got on the ballot through the effort of volunteers was a 1990 measure to protect mountain lions. Since then, petition gatherers wielding multiple clipboards have become ubiquitous at shopping malls, outside retail stores and at farmers' markets. They are paid per signature, rates that fluctuate as high as $6 per name, depending on how many initiatives are in circulation, how soon the petitions must be turned in and how difficult the sell. Signature gatherers who handle multiple initiatives have an incentive to push the ones that pay the most. The bidding wars and campaign high jinks can be fierce. They have included attempts to sabotage petitions by flooding them with false or duplicate names. As governor, Mr. Brown has vetoed several recent attempts to amend the process, principally by outlawing a fee-per-signature payment. While he acknowledged the propensity for manipulation, he argued that the per-signature system remains the cheapest. ""Eliminating this option will drive up the cost of circulating ballot measures, thereby further favoring the wealthiest interests,"" he wrote in a veto message. Mr. Brown has had more experience with initiatives than most. In his first campaign for governor in 1974, he piggybacked on a popular initiative he had crafted, the Political Reform Act, which established a commission to to regulate campaign finances, lobbying and ethics. Four years later, he was caught in the swirl of Proposition 13, the tax cut measure that remains the most far-reaching initiative in modern times. Like most elected officials, Mr. Brown opposed Prop 13, but then embraced it enthusiastically when it passed. Since his return to the governor's office in 2011, he has mastered the art of using initiatives to further his priorities. He devised and campaigned for measures that raised taxes, created a rainy-day fund and made major changes to the criminal-justice system. He has also amassed funds to fight off attempts to undo policies or hamper his objectives, learning from the experience of Prop 13, when such tactics were not yet in vogue. He has helped fend off ballot challenges to criminal-justice reforms and efforts to block his plans for high-speed rail. This year, he has helped fight a proposition on the November ballot that would repeal a recently enacted gas tax that funds highway repairs. Such campaigns are costly, in part because there are no limits on contributions. This November, in addition to the gas tax, voters will decide measures that affect issues including rent control, bonds for water projects and homeless housing, the size of cages for farm animals and the future of daylight saving time. As of the end of October, the amount raised to pass or defeat the 11 propositions was almost $368 million, about five times the amount raised by this year's two gubernatorial candidates. Figures in millions, as of Saturday.

By The New York Times | Source: Ballotpedia Even as voters sort through the barrage of advertising, several initiatives have already been approved to circulate petitions for signatures in an effort to qualify for the 2020 ballot. One of them involves a familiar subject: the soda tax. The last-minute deal to pull the beverage-industry-backed initiative off the ballot in exchange for the moratorium on local taxes was enabled by a 2014 law, intended to facilitate compromise. The use of the initiative in this case infuriated many, even those who voted for the deal because they saw no alternative. Assemblyman Jim Wood, a Northern California dentist, called it ""extortion."" But in the spirit of Hiram Johnson, they have not given up. Soon, signature gatherers will be wielding petitions to qualify the ""California Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Tax Initiative"" for the 2020 ballot.

News,2018-11-06,Wanted: Twelve people who can take four months off work and who don’t mind sitting in judgment of a man said to be the most notorious criminal of the 21st century. Payment: About $40 a day.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/nyregion/el-chapo-trial-jury.html,718," Wanted: Twelve people who can take four months off work and who don't mind sitting in judgment of a man said to be the most notorious criminal of the 21st century. Payment: About $40 a day. Picking a jury is always hard, but it is even more so when the defendant on trial is Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the former head of the Sinaloa drug cartel, a man accused of trafficking drugs by the ton and of having a hand in at least 30 murders. Mr. Guzman — known to the world as El Chapo — is such a fearsome figure that earlier this year, the judge in the case ruled that the jury would remain anonymous and would be escorted for their safety to and from the court each day by United States Marshals. [Read more about the unusual security measures being employed at the trial.] Still, as jury selection started Monday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, it was largely smooth sailing as the potential jurors seemed to evince little fear of the man who sat across from them, silent but watchful, in a navy blue suit and a crisp white shirt that was open to his sternum. Amid questions about their views on marijuana, their feelings about law enforcement and their fluency in Spanish, only one said that she was afraid of Mr. Guzman. Another admitted that the words ""El Chapo"" mostly made him think about a bagel sandwich served by a deli near his workplace that was named for the defendant. A third spent most of his time as he was questioned talking about his job as a Michael Jackson impersonator. Many of the jurors said they recognized Mr. Guzman's name and had at least heard that he was an international kingpin who had famously escaped from two Mexican prisons. Of the 46 people questioned on Monday by Judge Brian M. Cogan, 17 were dismissed, most of them because they said they could not be fair to Mr. Guzman or because the long trial would cause a financial hardship. Security was exceedingly tight. The courthouse was guarded by marshals, local court officers, a bomb-sniffing dog and a heavily armed tactical team of New York City police officers. Precautions like these apparently unnerved one potential juror, who admitted that the prospect of deciding Mr. Guzman's fate made her feel ""unsafe."" ""What scares me is I read that his family will come after jurors and their families,"" the woman said. She added that she knew that Mr. Guzman had two sons who were still at large. When a defense lawyer asked her if that made her nervous, she admitted that it did. Several prospective jurors said they were familiar with Mr. Guzman from the Netflix series ""El Chapo"" or had seen his page on Wikipedia, but they seemed largely unaware that he had been charged almost a decade ago with running a criminal enterprise that smuggled cocaine and heroin into the United States from Mexico in a rotating fleet of cars, trucks, yachts, planes and submarines. Mr. Guzman also stands accused of protecting his empire by murdering — or ordering the deaths of — dozens of people. [Read about some of the cooperating witnesses expected to testify.] Opening arguments are scheduled to begin next Tuesday, assuming a jury has been picked. Prosecutors are expected to offer up the epic tale of Mr. Guzman's rise from a teenage marijuana farmer to a ruthless kingpin who bribed officials in Mexico and often toted a gold-plated assault rifle. The jury will also likely hear about his two daring jailbreaks — one, at least according to lore, while hidden in a laundry cart and the other through a mile-long tunnel his associates dug into the shower of his cell. But the sobering facts at the heart of the case did not preclude jury selection from veering at times into the absurd. There was, after all, the juror who noted that his local deli had a sandwich called the ""El Chapo."" William Purpura, one of Mr. Guzman's lawyers, wanted to explore this coincidence, asking what precisely the sandwich was made of. It was, as it turned out, a bagel with cream cheese, capers and lox, the man explained. ""I don't know why it's called the 'El Chapo,'"" he said, ""but it's delicious."""
News,2018-11-06,"President Trump is wrong to equate the Democrats’ positions on immigration with open borders. Although they largely oppose his border wall, his calls to limit legal immigration and his family separation policy, Democratic lawmakers support border security measures.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/us/politics/fact-check-trump-rally-ohio-indiana-missouri.html,954," What Trump Said ""Donnelly also supports open borders."" — At a campaign rally on Monday in Fort Wayne, Ind. President Trump is wrong to equate the Democrats' positions on immigration with open borders. Although they largely oppose his border wall, his calls to limit legal immigration and his family separation policy, Democratic lawmakers support border security measures. Mr. Trump is even more wrong when he accuses Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, of supporting open borders, as Mr. Donnelly has often sided with Republicans and the White House on immigration. In February, Mr. Donnelly voted for a hard-line immigration bill supported by the White House that included funding for Mr. Trump's wall, and he also voted to defund so-called sanctuary cities. (Those legislative efforts failed.) Mr. Donnelly said in August that progressive calls to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency were ""a terrible idea,"" and said that ""it's important that we have strong, and safe, and secure borders, and ICE is a part of that."" In 2016, Mr. Donnelly voted for ""Kate's Law,"" which seeks harsher penalties on immigrants who re-enter the United States illegally after being deported. Mr. Trump often vows to secure its passage on the campaign trail.  NumbersUSA, a group that supports restricting immigration, gave Mr. Donnelly a ""C"" for his positions in recent years — tied with or higher than the grades for 10 Republican senators and all but one Democratic senator. What Trump Said ""He also had a big scandal — spent nearly $250 million of federal money to renovate a headquarters agency that the government doesn't even own, to lease, and more than twice what the entire building was worth, and the escalators or the elevators, I hear, cost — they're the most expensive elevators in the history of the world."" — At a campaign rally on Monday in Cleveland Richard Cordray, the Democratic candidate for governor in Ohio, was the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until last year. The bureau has been repeatedly criticized for a pricey renovation of its headquarters since 2014, but Mr. Trump's cost estimate is overstated. He is also wrong that the government does not own the building, and it is implausible that it houses ""the most expensive elevators in the history of the world."" The Treasury Department announced the location of the consumer bureau's headquarters in February 2011, before it was in operation, and noted that ""major building renovations were needed to make more efficient use of the space and to update the building to meet current energy and environmental standards,"" according to a 2015 inspector general report. While the consumer bureau is indeed leasing the space, the building is owned by a different federal agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. About $145 million was obligated for renovations, though the inspector general reported at the time that the project could potentially cost about $207 million over all. The report said those ""costs appear reasonable."" A 2017 construction progress report obtained by The Daily Caller shows that $124 million had been spent at that point, when 80 percent of the construction had been completed. The bureau moved into the building late last year, and Ken Sweet, a journalist at The Associated Press, reported this year that the bureau's office costs topped $240 million. But that figure includes rent as well as the renovations, Mr. Sweet said in an email. While ""the cost ballooned under Cordray's watch,"" Mr. Sweet said, Mr. Trump's statement is ""exaggerated.""  As for the elevators, Mr. Trump gave a specific estimate at a previous campaign stop in Ohio: $50 million, which would be a substantial part of the total cost of the renovation. Neither the 2017 progress report nor the 2015 inspector general report mentions elevators, and it is unclear where Mr. Trump got the figure from. But for context, a 1,070-foot glass elevator in China cost $20 million and an elevator set inside an aquarium in Berlin cost $17.4 million, according to Architectural Digest. Other Claims Mr. Trump also repeated numerous claims The New York Times has previously fact-checked:  He falsely claimed Democrats want to ""take away your health care."" (Democrats have consistently supported efforts to expand health care coverage.)  He falsely claimed Democrats support ""open borders."" (Democrats support border security measures.) He accused Democrats of inviting ""caravan after caravan."" (There is no evidence that Democrats are behind the migrant caravan.) He misleadingly claimed ""we've already started"" to build his promised border wall. (Construction has not begun.) He falsely said ""Medicare for all"" proposals would ""obliterate Medicare for seniors."" (The proposals expand coverage and benefits.) He claimed illegal immigration costs the country over $100 billion a year. (The figure comes from an anti-immigration group that has been heavily criticized by other researchers for methodological flaws.) He claimed lawmakers were unable to pass the Veterans Choice program for ""44 years."" (He enacted a bill making changes to the program, which was created in 2014.) He falsely claimed terminally ill patients could not gain access to experimental drugs before he signed a ""Right to Try"" law. (A similar federal program has existed since the 1970s.) He misleadingly claimed to have saved $1.1 billion on the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. (This figure conflates the cost of a temporary location with the cost of building a new permanent embassy.) He falsely claimed to have passed the largest tax cuts in American history. (Several others were larger.) He claimed Republicans would always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. (Republican legislation and actions by the Trump administration have undermined those protections.) He claimed association health plans, which his administration approved in June, will be ""frankly better insurance"" than those offered under the Affordable Care Act. (The association plans do not have to offer coverage of ""essential health benefits"" like maternity care, mental health care and prescription drugs.)"
News,2018-11-06,The gig economy has created economic opportunities for millions of people. Uber and Lyft have empowered everyday drivers to become paid chauffeurs. Airbnb has made homeowners hoteliers. And TaskRabbit has opened new markets for handymen and other laborers.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/business/dealbook/gig-economy-equity-sec-rule-701-uber-airbnb.html,918," The gig economy has created economic opportunities for millions of people. Uber and Lyft have empowered everyday drivers to become paid chauffeurs. Airbnb has made homeowners hoteliers. And TaskRabbit has opened new markets for handymen and other laborers. But much of the wealth created by these companies is not passed along to workers through conventional wages, but to a small number of insiders who own stock. Uber is eyeing an initial public offering that would value the company at $120 billion. Airbnb was valued at $31 billion last year. Lyft was recently valued at $15 billion. TaskRabbit was bought by Ikea last year for an undisclosed amount. In each case, employees and investors reap the vast majority of those profits, while the gig economy workers — arguably the ones creating much of the value for these companies — can't partake in those winnings. That's because they are contractors, not regular employees, and federal securities law restricts private companies from issuing shares to such workers. That may soon change. Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission requested public comments on potential updates to the laws that govern who can receive stock in private companies. Among the possible modifications to the law — known as Rule 701 — is a change that could have far-reaching implications for how gig economy workers are compensated. In considering a change, the S.E.C. is tacitly acknowledging that for all the value gig economy companies are creating, they are also, in some ways, contributing to the stark income inequality that is roiling society. Though contractors provide much of the labor for these tech companies, the S.E.C. noted that gig economy workers were not traditional employees who enjoyed conventional benefits and wages. ""Individuals participating in these arrangements do not enter into traditional employment relationships, and thus may not be 'employees' eligible to receive securities,"" the S.E.C. wrote, going on to ask whether nonemployees should also be eligible to receive stock. Companies were supportive of the idea. Uber, Airbnb and Postmates, a food-delivery start-up, all chimed in, saying they would welcome the change. ""Providing equity would allow partners to share in the growth of the company, which could lead to enhanced earning and saving opportunities for the partner and for the generations ahead,"" Uber's head of federal affairs, Danielle Burr, said in a letter to the S.E.C. Rob Chesnut, Airbnb general counsel, echoed the sentiments in his comments to the S.E.C. ""As a sharing economy marketplace, Airbnb succeeds when these hosts succeed,"" he wrote. ""We believe that enabling private companies to grant hosts and other sharing economy participants equity in the company from an earlier stage would further align incentives between such companies and their sharing economy participants to the benefit of both."" And Postmates said it hoped it could grant equity to its contractors. ""While we are proud that our fleet earns significantly higher than minimum wage across jurisdictions, we are also committed to the long term upward mobility of our Postmates,"" company executives wrote, using company jargon for its gig workers. Even gig workers chimed in. ""Permitting Uber contractors to own stock in the firm would be another measure which would allow a large group of people on the lower economic rung of society to make significant strides toward the greater wealth and financial security enjoyed by the middle class,"" wrote Brian Sament, who identified himself as an ""UberEats delivery guy."" Yet even if gig economy workers did have access to equity, there is no guarantee that it would solve their financial woes. Though it's not clear if such equity grants would replace or reduce wages, labor experts say that relying on private company stock is risky, especially for workers lacking financial security. ""Equity is not wages, it's risky,"" said Louis Hyman, a professor at Cornell University and author of ""Temp,"" a recent book on the labor market. ""For people who need to have a steady paycheck, this is not the answer."" Should the S.E.C. move ahead with such a plan, there are plenty of details still to be sorted out, including the tax treatment of such equity grants. If gig economy workers receive private company stock without any way to sell it, they could be liable for taxes on those gains, without having any easy way to pay those taxes. The S.E.C. could also need to modify other rules that stipulate that if companies distribute stock to more than 2,000 people who are not employees, such as accredited investors, they need to adhere to more rigorous public reporting requirements. And in one of the rare instances when a company tried to do something similar, it failed spectacularly. Juno, an Uber competitor, offered its drivers restricted stock units that were supposed to convert into lucrative equity. But when Juno was sold to another company, Gett, last year, the program was scrapped, and the equity was virtually worthless. And even before that happened, Juno was considering whether its program might have to be voided because of scrutiny from the S.E.C. Despite the inherent risks in such an arrangement, it's a fair bet that most gig economy workers would jump at the chance to get even a sliver of equity in a company like Uber or Airbnb. ""It's said that 'the greatest social program is a job,'"" Mr. Sament wrote the S.E.C. ""But a job or contractor position with stock benefits would help hundreds of thousands of people to do more than just tread water financially. We may be able to achieve some measure of security."""
News,2018-11-06,How to create more diverse workplaces and how to use artificial intelligence ethically are among the more challenging dilemmas facing business and government.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/business/dealbook/the-commonality-of-ai-and-diversity.html,1457," How to create more diverse workplaces and how to use artificial intelligence ethically are among the more challenging dilemmas facing business and government. While the issues may appear to have little in common besides their complexity, they do overlap. Recently, for example, according to news reports Amazon abandoned a hiring tool that used artificial intelligence because it favored men. These topics were the subject of two separate task forces that met at last week's DealBook conference. Each task force, composed of about a dozen experts and industry leaders, met for an hour, emerging with some specific guidelines and focus areas that were shared with the conference and could be taken back to companies and other organizations for discussion. Companies must be aware of and recognize that algorithms are not neutral, but created by humans with biases and beliefs and make every effort to eliminate those biases.  It is far too easy to assume that technology has an objectivity that humans don't. But the reality is that ""artificial intelligence and machine learning and algorithms in general are designed by none other than us — people,"" said Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. ""A.I. takes input data and races off to make inference and decision making about the world at lightening pace,"" he said, and those inferences will include unacknowledged biases unless people are willing to recognize them and invest the time and money to weed them out. Frida Polli, co-founder and chief executive of Pymetrics, which uses A.I. to recruit employees for companies, showed how biases could arise and how they could be diminished. Algorithms used in A.I. are created using training data sets. If a training data has an overrepresentation of any gender or ethnicity, the features that distinguish that group may be overweighted. To confront the problem, she said her company tested an algorithm on a reference group of people of different genders and ethnicities to check for bias. If there's an imbalance in the test run — far more men, for example, or whites are predicted to be good hires rather than women or other races — then ""we can look at de-weighting features,"" she said, that alter the algorithm. Technology companies can and should help the government — and the military in particular — develop and use artificial intelligence, but it must be done thoughtfully and carefully.  One of the first issues to arise in the task force was Microsoft's decision announced last month to bid on a $10 billion cloud computing contract for the Pentagon. This was after Google dropped out of the bid and told the military it would not provide A.I. products to build more accurate drones or compete with China in creating weaponry. ""The debate is ongoing about when and how to share technology with the government and specifically should companies share digital technology with the military,"" said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of business development at Microsoft. Most of the task force agreed that partnerships between technology companies and government on A.I. could be beneficial, but Serkan Piantino, founder and chief executive of Spell, a company that builds tools for those building A.I. technology, said there should be limits. ""Automating the process to use lethal force is something I wouldn't be comfortable doing, given how little we know with what is going on with A.I. algorithms,"" he said. A.I. requires transparency within the companies building and using it and with the public.  Having company employees debate and speak out on potentially controversial issues involving A.I. — such as at Microsoft — is one form of transparency. Dennis Crowley, co-founder and executive chairman of Foursquare, said his company had internal discussions when making business decisions that might have ethical implications. ""Sometimes we have the opportunity to create more evil than good, and we need to talk about that,"" he said. One example, he said, was whether his company would work with fast-food chains that wanted to target those using cannabis dispensaries where it was legal. It hadn't been done before. ""This was right on the edge, so we went to the ethics committee,"" Mr. Crowley said. In the end, ""we decided to do the campaign. It was legal and clever and a good use of technology around a category where we don't see a lot of advertising."" Cordell Schachter, the chief technology officer for the New York City Transportation Department, noted that transparency would be crucial with those creating the city's future transportation technology, which would be driven by A.I. ""We want to see the data — and not cherry-picked data — before it goes on the streets,"" he said. Companies should set targets and goals, along with incentives, as a way to foster a more diverse staff, but they shouldn't be used in a vacuum.  ""Aspirational goals are important, but "" it's just not enough,"" said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer for Goldman Sachs. ""It's not enough to say you want to get the world or your company to 50-50 — there needs to be transparency around that."" That means what specifically is the goal, and what is the company doing to achieve that goal — ""both good and bad,"" she said. ""There is a growing body of evidence that suggests cognitive diversity contributes to better decision making at the board level,"" said Cyrus Taraporevala, president and chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. ""Studies show that diverse boards pay more attention to risk management and are less susceptible to cronyism and group think."" But there's a danger that goals become items to be checked rather than real change. Damien Hooper-Campbell, chief diversity officer at eBay, said that while setting goals and targets for diversity was important — and backing it up with real costs, such as bonus deductions, if the goals aren't met — you also have to ""meet a company where it is."" If a company has just begun to focus on diversifying its work force, it needs to be educated on how to do it over time, he said. ""People talk about how businesses measure widgets and productivity, so they can measure this, too. But there's a big difference between widgets and human beings."" Federal policies and legislation can play a role in promoting diversity in the workplace.  Developing laws and policy to create diversity is not always a popular idea, but some say they believe that there are areas where government can help. John Hope Bryant, founder and chairman of Operation HOPE, a community organization, said there was a need for a federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships. When the effort is aimed at women and people of color, ""you should get double credit for that double reach."" A federal policy to encourage paid family leave would also play a crucial role in promoting diversity, said Sallie Krawcheck, chief executive and co-founder of Ellevest, a digital financial adviser for women. Federal policy could also help ensure that the information companies report on the makeup of their work forces and the compensation are truly transparent. For example, in Britain, many public-, private- and voluntary-sector companies are required to disclose average pay for men and women, including bonuses. In the United States, said Lauren Taylor Wolfe, managing partner of Impactive Capital, ""a lot of companies decide what they disclose and what not to disclose. If it's not done by level, it's not real transparency."" To be truly diverse and inclusive, a company must change its culture — and that has to come from the top down.  ""You can have policy and tactics, but if the culture is not ready to receive it, it will be an organ reject,"" said Thasunda Duckett, the chief executive of consumer banking at JPMorgan Chase. Or as Ms. Taylor Wolfe noted, ""companies get what they celebrate, and if they celebrate diversity, they'll get it."" No one expects cultural change to happen quickly, but one of the important elements, Ms. Duckett said, is that bosses need to ""manage to the difference."" Don't manage everyone the same and expect the same results. After all, parents don't expect each child to be the same — they parent differently depending on a child's personality, strengths and weaknesses, she said. Managers have to do the same. She also noted that diversity was not the same as inclusion and companies must be aware of that. ""Diversity,"" she said, ""is being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance."" Finally, change may seem glacially slow, but Mr. Hooper-Campbell said people shouldn't be surprised. ""It wasn't but 100 years ago that I couldn't go to school with some of the people in this room."""

But again, we love our son, and it is heartbreaking to realize we are essentially leaving him nothing tangible. What is the ethical thing for us to do? Name Withheld I am sorry to hear about your son. Knowing that his mistreatment of you and others is a result of an addiction he has not learned to manage can't make his behavior any less painful to experience. It explains, but it doesn't excuse. And your reasoning is sound: He would probably spend any money you leave him on doing himself further harm. It's true that the allocations in a will have an expressive aspect as well as a material one, but your love for your son would be conveyed by the consideration you are showing in setting up a trust. We should respect the autonomy of others. Yet addiction is effectively a disease of autonomy. Treating addicts who are not in recovery as if they can make reasonable decisions is a mistake. Better to ensure that the money will be used for his genuine welfare. I am an adjunct instructor at a small art school I will call College A. Because of the financial instability of this position, several of my colleagues and I also teach for a different school online, College B.  Throughout my time working for College B, I've been asked to rewrite and develop course content for its online curriculum, a great source of revenue. To develop this content, I have used my expertise from teaching previous classes, but I have always been careful to change the course so that the students have a unique experience; I believe it is my ethical obligation to create new content if I am being paid to do so. Also, the students we teach at both schools will essentially be one another's competition upon graduation, so it is important to me that each school show distinct projects. It has never been explicitly stated by either school, but I assume that they do not want me taking content I have developed from one college and selling it to another. Several weeks ago, I was grading final portfolios for the students in College B and noticed that their projects looked extremely similar to work I have seen from students in College A. When I looked, I saw that the professor for the class for College B was the same professor who teaches the course at College A. It appears that my colleague developed the curriculum for one college, and instead of developing something new, self-plagiarized and sold duplicate content. My colleague's employment at both colleges precedes mine, so I am not sure which college the colleague originally created the content for and which college received the plagiarized content. To me, there are several ethical issues here: First, self-plagiarism or plagiarism is grounds for expelling a student; I suspect this would also be true for teachers. Second, it is my understanding that what is created for one school belongs to the school, so this is copyright infringement. Third, tuition for each of the schools is different, but students are getting the same product at two different prices. Fourth, when they apply for jobs, students are competing with what they believe is a portfolio of unique projects, but they are not. When we homogenize the curriculum of education for this degree, we lose the diversity of thought that comes from new pedagogical experiences. Finally, online education in my industry is growing, and my colleague seems to be the first one in the door developing course content for all the schools; I suspect this will continue if the colleague is not stopped. What is my ethical obligation here? I have a good rapport with both of my bosses, but if I were to report my colleague, it would be obvious it was me. I have been paid in the past to fix and refine courses that this colleague developed for the online curriculum for College B, content that was also self-plagiarized and raises questions about quality too. If I were to report this colleague, I would potentially be securing additional employment for myself to rewrite the courses, which could be viewed as self-serving. What's a prof to do? Name Withheld It isn't easy to keep clear about issues of intellectual property, as your letter shows. Generally speaking, when teachers at one institution join the faculty of another, whether as a visitor or as a permanent member, they are free to use a curriculum that they have developed, unless the first institution has acquired copyright to it. One college hires a Milton scholar from another college, and the syllabus of the Milton seminar she has developed over the years comes with her. Nobody sees this as a problem. And given that there are some terrific and widely used textbooks, plenty of students study the same curriculum at different institutions. Indeed, the whole idea of self-plagiarism is distinctly unhelpful. Certainly, there can be issues of property and of contract here. If you create an intellectual product, it may be wrong to sell it to someone because you've already sold it to someone else or because you otherwise agreed not to do so — or simply because there's a settled expectation that you won't. (It's perhaps worth noting that this problem wouldn't have arisen if your colleague were afforded a position that was properly paid and that, in consequence, discouraged him from teaching elsewhere.) But scholars routinely rework their essays or lectures into books, and we call that process road-testing, not self-plagiarism. We shouldn't even speak of self-plagiarism when students submit the same work in different classes: The sin here doesn't involve intellectual theft; it involves dishonesty and sometimes laziness. But there's a set of serious questions that you're pointing to. As large-scale online education develops, with less and less interaction between students and teachers, the value of a course is going to depend mostly on the materials associated with it and the instructional tools that guide students through those materials. People developing materials for these courses will be selling them once, producing copyrighted material that will often belong to the course provider. Legal issues of defining what counts as breaching the copyright will naturally arise. In such a world, if two online courses created by the same person look very similar, valid legal complaints may arise. Still, it strikes me that the risk of intellectual homogenization here is easily overstated. This might be a concern if one professor or course truly dominated a field, which is unlikely, and even at art school, the same assignment is likely to produce widely different responses. And students might be better off using a great curriculum that is also used at a variety of other institutions than a lousy curriculum created just for them."

What started as a few unpleasant aches soon became debilitating pain throughout her body. A heavy fatigue settled into her bones: Holding scissors or sweeping the floor became too much. She slept fitfully; her memory flagged. Frustrated by many symptoms and few answers, she grew anxious and depressed. Our medical team, after a battery of unrevealing tests, settled on a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Tears welled in her eyes as I explained the diagnosis, and I worried I'd been too brusque. But these were tears of relief, she said, not because the symptoms had ceased, but because she finally had an answer, a name for her pain. Those who suffer without a clear understanding of its cause experience a unique form of torment. There is great power in diagnosis: It can be comforting, terrifying, and sometimes, even healing. There's evidence, for example, that patients who receive a new diagnosis of fibromyalgia — for which there is limited treatment — may have fewer symptoms, be more satisfied with their health, and possibly incur lower costs. But fibromyalgia wasn't a recognized diagnosis 30 years ago. Nor were many other now-common diagnoses that have only recently been recognized and treated as medical conditions. Since the 1980s, there's been rapid expansion in the number and complexity of medical diagnoses — a trend known as ""medicalization."" A recent study found that the cost of 12 newly medicalized conditions — things like irritable bowel syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, low testosterone, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — now approaches $80 billion a year, or about 4 percent of total health care spending. That's about as much as we spend on heart disease or cancer, and more than we spend on public health initiatives. Our ever-expanding armamentarium of diagnoses no doubt offers comfort, attention and a path to treatment for many previously undiagnosed — and undiagnosable — patients. But we may also be medicalizing much of normal human behavior — labeling the healthy as diseased, and exposing them to undue risk of stigma, testing and treatment. Trouble sleeping is now insomnia. Shyness is social phobia. Grief is depression. Infidelity is sex addiction. It's not that these diseases don't exist — the spectrum of human behavior is broad, and the extremes do represent real pathology — but we may be drawing lines in the wrong places, with negative health and financial consequences. A central problem is that medicalized diagnoses often come with medicalized treatments: Our penchant for pills outstrips even our desire for diagnosis. Since the 1990s, the number of office visits for sleep problems has doubled, and diagnoses of insomnia have increased sevenfold. But prescriptions for sleep medications have increased more than 30 times. This is perhaps most concerning for children. About 12 percent of children in America now carry a diagnosis of A.D.H.D, and there was a 40-fold increase in childhood bipolar disorder diagnoses between 1994 and 2003. Five times as many children are now prescribed psychostimulant and antipsychotic medications as were in the 1980s. Today, a quarter of children and teenagers take prescription drugs regularly, and seven percent of older adolescents and young adults report abusing opioids — most of whom were initially prescribed them by a doctor. With millions of Americans taking risky medications for questionable diagnoses, have we medicalized everyday life? There's no shortage of factors that have gotten us here. The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, has taken an active, sometimes dubious, role in defining and promoting new diagnoses, through direct-to-consumer advertising and physician outreach efforts. Often overlooked, however, are how the psychologies of doctors and patients contribute. Clinical encounters that don't end with a definitive diagnosis — a clear acknowledgment of the enemy — are inherently unsatisfying. Doctors, through their training and mandate, are motivated to package a constellation of symptoms into something that can be understood, named and treated. At the same time, we have both a growing arsenal of medications to fix patients' problems and a steadily shrinking number of minutes in which to do so. Not surprisingly, the path of least resistance becomes labeling and prescribing instead of exploring and managing. Patients are motivated by the understandable desire to name and ease their suffering — and today, many more patients have that opportunity. But it also means that much of normal human experience is treated with prescriptions instead of patience. This is perhaps not surprising. We increasingly have easy solutions at our fingertips: Dial-up modems have given way to broadband; stores are being replaced by Amazon drones; courtship is now Tinder. Is it wrong for patients to expect quick fixes from medicine? An important step forward may be putting more emphasis on nonprescription remedies. For many medicalized conditions, lifestyle changes are often just as effective as medications, if not more so (and don't come with side effects). Patients and doctors should also regularly revisit whether a given diagnosis still applies over time. Many patients diagnosed with depression, asthma, acid reflux or insomnia may not meet criteria for these conditions when reassessed, but they often continue taking medications even after symptoms have resolved. More fundamentally, we need to reconsider where the upper and lower bounds of diagnosis should be. Many experts believe the pendulum has swung too far, such that much of normal human behavior now falls within treatment thresholds. This reassessment is particularly important because those with mild or borderline symptoms may be less likely to benefit from treatment than those with more severe symptoms. Diagnosis is complicated. It can be a path to acceptance and treatment, or a road to risk and stigma. More diagnoses mean more patients can heal but also that more might suffer. Figuring out who will be helped — and who will harmed — might be the most important diagnosis we make. Dhruv Khullar, M.D., M.P.P.

News,2018-11-06,"[See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors’ races, and read our analysis.]",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/politics/patriotism-midterms-trump.html,1985," [See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors' races, and read our analysis.] DES MOINES — President Trump has spent his 21 months in office labeling his critics as unpatriotic. N.F.L. players who kneel during the national anthem possibly ""shouldn't be in the country,"" he has said. Journalists who write unflattering stories are ""enemies of the people."" Democratic lawmakers who did not clap for his State of the Union address were ""treasonous."" And yet, for Bridget Carberry Montgomery, a Democrat in Iowa, this is a time when she has never felt more patriotic. Ms. Montgomery, a 43-year-old mother of four, had never gotten involved in politics before this fall, when she led a group that met Sunday nights at a sports bar, with children in tow, to write postcards urging Iowans to turn out to vote. ""I love my country and I want it to be the very best version of itself,"" she said. She added, ""I feel emboldened in my patriotism."" As the nation goes to the polls in what is widely seen as a referendum on the president's conduct, policies and character, both his supporters and his opponents are expressing sharply contrasting views on issues like immigration, guns and the courts. But increasingly they differ on something more fundamental: what it means to be patriotic and how to express that politically. Here in the middle of the country, where three of Iowa's four House races are competitive, and where Mr. Trump first rewrote the rules of patriotism by attacking a war hero and ex-P.O.W., Senator John McCain, it is clear that Republicans and Democrats part ways over the meaning of duty, respect and love of country. For Republicans and Mr. Trump, who was joined for his final rallies by the singer Lee Greenwood, who performed his anthem ""God Bless the USA,"" patriotism in politics often means conspicuous displays of respect for the traditional expressions of America — the flag, the military, the Pledge of Allegiance. Denise Bubeck, a Republican in Grimes, Iowa, works for an advocacy group that promotes ""family values"" such as heterosexual marriage and opposition to abortion. For her, standing to show respect for the flag is nonnegotiable. When she sees athletes kneeling in protest of police brutality during the anthem, she thinks of a grandfather who was killed in the battle of Iwo Jima. ""People actually shed blood for the freedoms we have,"" she said. ""We need to show respect for this country."" But, particularly in this election season, many Democrats described their vote as a different form of patriotism, an urgent effort to protect and reclaim American democracy. That view tries to redefine a subject Democrats in the past have often ceded, politically, to Republicans. Democrats see a president who has sought to use the Justice Department against his political enemies, to undo constitutional protections including freedom of speech and birthright citizenship, and who has dangerous authoritarian tendencies. They are furious at the Republican majorities in Congress for not exercising their responsibility to hold Mr. Trump accountable. Democrats ""are rallying around a rhetoric of 'you've got to go out and do this to save the country' — that voting is going to be a patriotic act, that there are norms being violated and institutions corrupted,"" said Kevin M. Kruse, a historian at Princeton University. Some conservative intellectuals think Democrats' efforts to seize a patriotic mantle is fundamentally flawed. They argue that progressive politics is built on grievances about racism, sexism and other alleged sins of America. Support for President Trump can be explained in part as a patriotic backlash to the left's ongoing critique of America, said Shelby Steele, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. ""Trump is president today because the left got drunk on its sanctimony, on its moral superiority, and actually put down these people, and in many cases quite unfairly,"" Mr. Steele said. ""And so the explosive support for this guy from nowhere is those people who felt overlooked and excluded from this new vision of America, this new liberal innocence. They want to be — they believe — that they're really proud Americans, and their patriotism is built on American self-esteem."" A defining moment this campaign season was when Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic Senate candidate in Texas, responded to a question about N.F.L. players who kneel during the national anthem to protest police killings of blacks. ""I can think of nothing more American,"" Mr. O'Rourke said of the protests, in a speech that went viral. The next day, the president told supporters in West Virginia, ""You're proud of our country, you're proud of our history, and unlike the N.F.L., you always honor and cherish our great American flag."" Democrats and Republicans are divided over the acceptability of dissent as a component of patriotism. Kristen Anderson, a 34-year-old new mother who lives in Des Moines, sees protests very differently. She invoked the definition of patriotism written by James Baldwin: ""I love America more than any other country in the world and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually."" Ms. Anderson, who works for a financial company, said her vote for the Democratic challenger in a tight race in Iowa's Third Congressional District was a vote to flip the House majority, and put a check on the president. ""I think anyone who's paying any attention should be worried about democracy,"" she said. She said her own family was directly threatened. As a lesbian, she said the constitutional protection of her marriage felt vulnerable with Mr. Trump's Supreme Court picks. Her spouse, a Latina immigrant, has a green card. ""But with this administration's antagonism toward immigrants, especially those of Latino descent, and in a homosexual partnership — I can't trust this administration to honor precedents or laws,"" Ms. Anderson said. Like nearly everything in the Trump era, Americans' divisions over patriotism have become more partisan, polls suggest. Gallup, which since 2001 has asked people how proud they are as Americans, found this year that 74 percent of Republicans are extremely proud, but since Mr. Trump's election, the share of Democrats who are extremely proud to be American has plummeted to 32 percent. A YouGov survey this year found majorities of Democrats said a person can be patriotic who criticizes American leaders to foreigners, disobeys a law believed to be immoral or refuses to serve in a war believed unjust. Far fewer Republicans agreed that such dissents were compatible with patriotism. Brian Myers, a Republican small business owner in Madrid, Iowa, who did not vote for Mr. Trump (he wrote in Bobby Jindal, the former governor of Louisiana), said he was troubled by polls showing a drop in Democrats' pride in America. ""So often now I see people characterize the American flag as an offensive item,"" he said. ""'It's a symbol of racism and bigotry.' I just find that appalling."" Tyler Higgs, 32, a school psychologist who lives in Clive, Iowa, rejected the conservative critique that as a progressive he hates America. Mr. Higgs founded a local chapter of Indivisible, a grass-roots network on the left. ""Why are we knocking on doors, why are we going to legislative forums and writing letters to our legislators if we hate our country?"" he said. ""All these things they say are liberal outrage — that's patriotism."" Mr. Higgs called the midterms ""insanely important,"" listing ways he thought Mr. Trump was a threat to democracy: undermining the electoral process, attacking the independent press and ""stoking white supremacists in our society."" Many Republicans view this fear as overblown, even paranoid. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Iowa's senior Republican, said Democrats should relax, and that the Constitution's separation of powers remains intact. He recalled his first election to the House in 1974, shortly after Richard Nixon resigned, when there was wild talk about a military coup. But the Republic survived. ""As long as you've got the Constitution's checks and balances, what these Democrats are saying about the threat from Trump has no basis,"" Mr. Grassley said. Republicans for years owned the upper hand on patriotism as a political issue. The advantage dated at least to the Vietnam era, when some on the left equated the flag and the military with shameful symbols of American power. In the 1980s, Republicans mastered using the flag as a wedge issue in the culture wars. They later attacked President Barack Obama for going on what they called an ""apology tour"" of foreign countries and an insufficient embrace of ""American exceptionalism."" This year, however, with American prestige in the world suffering under Mr. Trump, Democrats have seen an opportunity and sought to rewrite the patriotism script. They nominated a slew of military veterans in Republican-held House districts. Many are women with tours of combat or the service academies on their résumés. The candidates include Amy McGrath in Kentucky, Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Elaine Luria in Virginia. Abigail Spanberger, running in Virginia, is a former C.I.A. antiterrorism officer. Jean Ludwig, 75, a retired financial adviser, has been knocking on doors for Republican candidates in Carroll, Iowa, including for Gov. Kim Reynolds and Representative Steve King. ""I wish there was more I could do,"" she said. In her view, a factual assessment of the Trump presidency would conclude that he has done an excellent job, but Democrats, who ""are more controlled by emotions,"" she said, have been unwilling to see it. ""They don't talk to anybody, just to each other: 'I hate the president, don't you?"" She said she particularly dislikes the news media telling her what to think rather than, in her view, reporting things straight. When Mr. Trump called himself a ""nationalist,"" much of the coverage was critical because of the historical association of the term with white supremacy; Ms. Ludwig called that media bias. ""Nationalism is a perfectly fine thing. It just means we're going to look out for the United States first,"" she said. Not far from Ms. Ludwig's home county, Emily Alberhasky hears something much more sinister in the president calling himself a nationalist. For her, it is the opposite of patriotism. ""He is giving voice and power to the racist underbelly of this country,"" said Ms. Alberhasky, 40, a mother of five from Ankeny, Iowa. ""When President Trump speaks about the caravan or any of the hundreds of thousands trying to get asylum or find safety in our country, and he speaks about them the way we have heard other groups, including Jews, be talked about in history, it gives me chills to the bone."" ""The association with the word nationalism is not one of democracy and acceptance,"" she said. ""It has a very heavy tone of judgment and supremacy to it."" She said the Trump administration has caused her fear and sleepless nights. ""Am I proud to be an American?"" she said. ""I don't think I can say I am right now. I feel really disappointed in close to half of this country. I feel embarrassed and ashamed that this is our current situation."" She added: ""But I'm really proud of more than half of our country and I feel very patriotic that I want this country to get back to, or maybe self-actualize up to, a place of being who we truly are, which is a very diverse, very eclectic, beautiful mix of all kinds of people."" Ms. Alberhasky had never been involved with politics before this year. She spent the days leading to Tuesday working 12-hour shifts in a campaign office, mobilizing volunteers to get out votes for Democrats. Dr. William J. Barber II, the North Carolina pastor and champion of liberal causes who lead protests known as Moral Mondays at the State Capitol, said the idea of eternally seeking to improve America is enshrined in some of the nation's most patriotic texts. He cited ""America, the Beautiful"" and its lyrics: ""America! America! God mend thine every flaw."""
Op-Ed,2018-11-06,"Gail Collins: Bret, can you remember any other Election Day that was ever like this? With the whole nation so crazy nervous-excited about congressional races? I do not believe in other years I had intense conversations with neighbors about who was going to win the Indiana Senate race.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/opinion/midterms-elections-predictions.html,1781," Gail Collins: Bret, can you remember any other Election Day that was ever like this? With the whole nation so crazy nervous-excited about congressional races? I do not believe in other years I had intense conversations with neighbors about who was going to win the Indiana Senate race. Bret Stephens: The only thing that's remotely comparable in my memory, Gail, were the 1994 midterms, when Republicans regained control of the House after 40 years in the minority. One reason that election is worth mentioning is that it probably did more to strengthen Bill Clinton's presidency, after a chaotic first two years, than it did to weaken it. It gave Clinton a useful political foil in the person of Republican speaker Newt Gingrich, and it forced him to compromise on politically popular legislation, like welfare reform. My point, to those of us who want to ensure that Donald Trump is a one-term president, is to be careful what we wish for. Whatever happens on Tuesday isn't going to decide what happens in 2020. Or am I missing the forest for the trees here? Gail: Depends which forest you're meandering in. If, as most people presume, the Democrats take the House but Republicans keep the Senate, we'll see some interesting investigations into the president. I do sorta dream at night of seeing all those tax returns. But you're right that Trump will try to turn Nancy Pelosi into the new version of immigrant caravans. The Republicans have made her into their all-purpose target already, even when she hasn't actually had the power to do anything to thwart them. I don't think we've ever really talked about Pelosi. If you were the Democrats, would you replace her or would any new Democratic speaker become the same kind of whipping person? Bret: Pelosi personifies the Democratic Party a lot of people love to hate: wealthy coastal liberals who have been in office forever and cannot imagine why anyone who voted for Trump did so for reasons other than bigotry or imbecility. If she becomes speaker again, Democrats will be materially damaging their chances of defeating Trump in two years. Please, someone else, like Ohio's Tim Ryan or Massachusetts' Seth Moulton: Someone who can help win back the millions of voters who went for Barack Obama in 2008 and Trump eight years later. About those investigations: Yes, they might be very interesting. But I tend to doubt we'll learn anything from them that we won't eventually find out from Robert Mueller, and whatever he produces will have greater credibility for not being partisan. Also, investigating the past is probably not what's going to decide the election. Democrats need to put forward an agenda, work with the Trump administration on things like immigration reform and an infrastructure bill, and appeal to a wider cross-section of Americans. The question of Trump's tax returns is mostly a distraction from that goal. Gail: Yes, of course, you're right about the agenda. But the evil side of me really, really wants those tax returns. Bret: My evil side wants to outlaw New England sports franchises and zap people who walk too slowly on Manhattan sidewalks as they stare at their smartphones. Gail: On the Pelosi front, I do think the Democrats need new faces. But she deserves a little bit of a run first — I hate the idea of just caving into the Republicans' demonization of her. Have we discussed the way all of Trump's regular Democratic targets — except with the perfunctory nod to Chuck Schumer — are women? Does anybody think his tirades about Maxine Waters aren't playing to the Republicans' worst strain of racism and sexism? I just got a generic fund-raising letter from Eric Trump's wife, Lara. (No idea why I'm on her list, but it's always interesting to hear what the president's daughter-in-law has to say … ) The message was to send in one last contribution because ""we can't let Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters run the people's House."" Maxine Waters is ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, for God's sake. There are a dozen Democrats way more powerful and influential than she is. Bret: Speaking of singling out minorities, one of Trump's signature election themes — both in this cycle and the last — is the vilification of Latin American migrants. It's not enough for him and other Republicans to campaign on historically low unemployment and a big jump in annual wage growth. He needs a bugaboo, and the images of the migrant caravan play into his base's biggest phobias. Did I mention that last week was the 80th anniversary of Orson Welles's ""The War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast, featuring an imaginary Martian invasion? Gail: O.K., I really do like that ""War of the Worlds"" comparison. They're coming! They're coming! Bret: The question is whether it will work. I'm hoping it won't. But my guess is that elections in the United States have now become base plays where the key is to get your people to the polls rather than win over undecided voters. It also doesn't help that Democrats have barely made an effort to offer their own ideas about the caravan. Health care isn't the only issue in the world. Gail: There's also the importance of stopping the Republican agenda. There are only a few things they're actually capable of passing legislation on — maybe Kindness to Kittens Week, although I'm not even sure that one would get past our pet-phobic president. But one is taxes. Tax reform is fine but all the Republicans can do is cut, which means slashing revenue, adding to the deficit and increasing pressure on important social programs. I realize we are not entirely in accord on this matter. Bret: Tax cuts, I like. Deficits, I don't mind (as long as there is robust economic growth). But I like the Republic even more, and I'd hate to see Trump's first two years in office vindicated with wins in both houses of Congress. So I'm prepared to forgo additional tax cuts in the hope, probably vain, that Democrats will be strategic stewards in the House and not give in to the stupid temptation of seeking Trump's impeachment or getting lost in endless committee investigations about whether Trump misled the I.R.S. 20 or 30 years ago. I'd also love to see the emergence of Democratic presidential contenders who aren't the same people now auditioning for the role. Gail: Which includes … pretty much everybody. Are you hoping for a governor who hasn't raised his or her hand? A former cabinet member who's been working in the library on a new book for the last two years? Tom Hanks? Everybody likes Tom Hanks. Bret: Well, I can think of one former Hollywood actor who turned out to be a great president, so I'm not ruling it out. And as much as Ronald Reagan was hated by progressives, he did a lot to unite the country, which is what we could use now. The hideous anti-Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh, and the resistance of many Pittsburgh residents to Trump even showing up, is another reminder that Trump can't fulfill even the most basic presidential duty of consoling a wounded nation. We need a Democrat who can address the fact that the United States is in a moral recession even in the midst of an economic boom. Gail: We may be down to Tom Hanks. Bret: Or Michelle Obama. Gail: But seriously, I keep thinking about how we got to Trump, and how Trump got to Trump. He was a guy with virtually no political principles or governmental ideas when he started out. And early on, when you asked him why he was so obsessed with a wall, or why he had apparently changed his mind on abortion and gun control, the answer would invariably be that the crowd went crazy over that. He's a total creation of the yelling crowds. Sure, he gets huge audiences, because they know he's going to tell them exactly what they want to hear. And when they roar their approval, it reinforces his determination to do whatever they scream loudest about. I guess the big question is how much the people who come out to howl at his rallies reflect the people who come out to vote. Bret: There's a side of me that thinks that Trump is a natural culmination for a country that has spent the past 60 years besotted with television, the past 50 with moral relativism, the past 40 with ostentation, the past 30 with the politics of sex, and the past 20 with the politics of fear. He seems to encapsulate all of it. Gail: Don't forget the internet. And Fox. Bret: But I also think that it's a mistake to treat him as pure product of the crowd. For all the Democratic talk that the economy blossomed under Obama, there were pockets of the recession that never went away for the eight years of his presidency. It showed up in the large number of discouraged workers, especially those in late middle age, and probably in the opioid crisis. And Trump found a way to speak to that part of the United States in a way that Hillary Clinton never did. The Democrat who can win will be able to do the same. Gail: I agree, and hoping for a Democrat who can speak to all the parts of the country. Or at least most. Speaking of — um, it was elections, right? Any particular one candidate you're dying to see win/get creamed? Bret: It probably isn't going to happen, but I'd love to see the Democratic candidate in Tennessee, Phil Bredesen, pull off an upset in his Senate race against Marsha Blackburn. He represents the kind of centrism the party could really use. I also like Rhode Island's Gina Raimondo, a pragmatic Democratic governor, and I'm happy to see Charlie Baker, the Republican governor of Massachusetts, having no trouble with his re-election bid. You can probably see where I am here: I tend to like red state Democrats and blue state Republicans, people who by temperament and necessity have to learn to get along with the other side. I think I know what you're thinking: The country is in crisis, a G.O.P. victory in the House would consolidate a reign of bigotry and ruin — and this guy wants everyone to have a lollipop and be nicer to their neighbors. But after the last couple of years, I think that would be achievement enough. Gail: Totally in favor of the lollipop. Putting in a Hail Mary that somehow the evil racist Steve King loses his seat in Iowa. And that we have another two years of arguing about tax cuts without the danger there will really be any. Happy voting, Bret. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."

Sign up here. As voters head to the polls, employees at Facebook and Twitter will be on high alert. Neither company wants a repeat of 2016, when Russian operatives used their platforms to influence voters. Both claim to be ready. Twitter now automatically detects suspicious activity, and has been working with the Department of Homeland Security. (""We are more prepared than we have ever been,"" Del Harvey, Twitter's head of trust and safety told the NYT.) On Monday, Facebook took down 115 accounts accused of spreading misinformation. While trolls reportedly say that it's harder to operate on Twitter these days, a recent study by researchers at Oxford University showed that the social network now features 5 percent more false content than in 2016. And new research from the Tow Center for Digital Journalism claims that Facebook is still rife with falsehoods. In other words: You're still likely to see misinformation today. Here's what to look for, and what to do if you spot it. Opinion: Is it time for online voting? Big companies are helping employees get to the polls today. That's partly because they're eager to demonstrate their civic responsibility — but also because they have a stake in the outcome. The S&P 500 has risen 28 percent since President Trump took office, aided by last year's tax cuts and continued improvement in the economy. (Though the biggest winners and losers among stocks have little direct link to Trump administration policy.) But what happens if there is a big Democratic victory? Analysts appear split on the effect on the stock market. Elsewhere, the WSJ points out that other business matters stand to be affected: Infrastructure spending would most likely gain favor in Congress, while defense and agriculture could face more roadblocks. Perhaps more than ever, Beijing is interested in how Americans vote. A strong showing by Democrats would weaken President Trump — which could be a boon for China, whose economy is beginning to suffer from American tariffs. More on that from the scholar Anson Au in the South China Morning Post: If the Republicans lose their majority in both upper and lower chambers, gone will be the days where Trump does anything he wants. There'll be less room for chest-thumping bravado and more need for rational policy making and diplomacy. Trump would have to change his approach to adopt a more moderate tone: where before he could command, he would have to negotiate — with other countries, and within his own. Labor Department data shows hiring is getting harder. In August, there were 114 job openings for every 100 unemployed workers, the most lopsided ratio on record. Economists expect figures published today to show that the gap has widened. (Plus: Janet Yellen, the former Fed chairwoman, says full employment would help improve equality.) Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain puts pressure on her euroskeptic ministers. She is expected to warn critics in her party that time is running out to cut a deal with the E.U. So much for one HQ2. Amazon is nearing a decision to open two hubs, one in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens and the other in the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb. That's a last-minute change to a yearlong search for the location of the company's biggest office outside Seattle. More from Karen Weise and J. David Goodman of the NYT on Amazon's reasoning: Picking multiple sites would allow it to tap into two pools of talented labor and perhaps avoid being blamed for all of the housing and traffic woes of dominating a single area. It could also give the company greater leverage in negotiating tax incentives, experts said. ""Even if the most obvious reasons appear to be about attracting more tech workers, the P.R. and government incentives benefits could help, too,"" said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the online jobs site. Amazon already has large operations in both areas, which both have plenty of tech talent. But the decision would mean that neither city could really claim to have a campus equal to the one in Seattle, as Amazon originally promised. More Amazon news: Some employees reportedly hope to confront Jeff Bezos about the company's law-enforcement work on Thursday. High-level talks between Washington and Beijing are being rekindled. First, President Trump held a ""long and very good conversation"" on trade with President Xi Jinping of China last week. Now, Reuters reports, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will hold talks with senior Chinese officials in Washington later this week. The Chinese vice president, Wang Qishan, said today that China was ready for discussions ""on issues of mutual concern"" that could lead to a deal ""acceptable to both sides."" He added that ""China and the U.S. will both gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation,"" echoing recent comments from Mr. Xi. But a note of caution: Mr. Trump said on Monday that ""if we can make the right deal, a deal that's fair, we'll do that. Otherwise we won't do it."" He and Mr. Xi are expected to meet at the G-20 summit meeting in Argentina this month. After intense criticism about the way Facebook was used to incite violence in Myanmar, the company commissioned an independent investigation. The final report, written by the San Francisco-based nonprofit Business for Social Responsibility, says, ""Facebook has become a means for those seeking to spread hate and cause harm, and posts have been linked to offline violence."" In a blog post, Facebook's product policy manager, Alex Warofka, reflected on the findings: ""The report concludes that, prior to this year, we weren't doing enough to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence. We agree that we can and should do more."" When 13 American venture capitalists and tech executives visited China in August, they found a lot to like in the country's tech scene. Not least of which was crazy work hours, with one investor exclaiming, ""We're so lazy in the U.S.!"" But Li Yuan of the NYT notes that these Silicon Valley emissaries also found much to worry about: Chinese technology executives, they found, were even more driven and more willing to do whatever it takes to win. But that comes with major trade-offs, and punishing work schedules are only the beginning. They found Chinese tech executives to be less reflective about the social impact and potential misuse of their technologies, a potentially worrisome quality in a country with loosely enforced privacy laws, strict government censorship and a powerful domestic surveillance apparatus. More: The Starbucks C.E.O. says he'll bring the coffee chain's innovations in China to the U.S. Bloomberg Businessweek took a close look at Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and how he has become the most prominent holder of that office in decades. Normally, the Commerce Department is short on policy influence, but Mr. Ross has made himself a loud advocate of President Trump's nationalistic trade policies. The magazine explains how he assumed a very visible role: When he tapped Ross in late 2016 for the position, the president-elect called him ""a killer"" and promised Ross would be a key adviser in the crusade to throw over the chessboard when it comes to America's trade relationships. ""Wilbur's at all the meetings,"" says Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council. ""All the meetings. He's been a big player in the Trump administration.""

Another was historically Democratic from the power of the railroad unions, then veered toward the Republicans. A third is liberal on its western side, conservative to the east, and locked in a battle over which side will prevail. Three of Washington State's 10 congressional districts are in play in Tuesday's election — all considered competitive by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report — and so all three are potentially crucial to Republicans in holding their majority in the House of Representatives, and to Democrats in their hopes of taking back the House. Two seats are held by Republican incumbents, while the third is an open seat being vacated by a Republican. Washington State as a whole leans left these days, from the dominance in population of the Seattle area — both senators are Democrats, as are six of the 10 House members. But the state's three in-play districts do not fit that pattern, or really any pattern. All are starkly different from one another in economics, demographics, history and in the pitches that the candidates are making to voters. [Follow live results for the House of Representatives and the Senate.] Here is a look at three key races that could be pivotal on Tuesday — though the results may not be known until the wee hours of Wednesday or later, given that ballots in the state's vote-by-mail election can be postmarked as late as Election Day itself. Railroads and a perfect climate for soft white winter wheat have shaped the huge Fifth District that stretches across Washington's east side from Canada to Oregon. Once, in another political era, Representative Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat and the former speaker of the House, dominated the district, but most of the current century has belonged to Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers. Ms. Rodgers, a Republican first elected in 2004, is the highest-ranking female Republican in the House, as chair of the Republican Conference, which articulates policies for the majority, and has mostly batted away challengers in recent elections like pesky flies. But the district, anchored by Spokane, Washington's second largest city after Seattle, has also been changing, becoming more urban and more politically and ethnically diverse. Some rural corners of the district have struggled, with about one in eight residents living below the poverty line, and some counties, in losing young people, have become among the fastest aging in the state. The power of the railroad unions that once backed politicians like Mr. Foley faded long ago. In the all-party primary election in August, Ms. Rodgers was jolted by a surprisingly narrow victory — about 4 percentage points — over Lisa Brown, a Democratic former state legislator and economics professor. As the top two finishers, they will face one another again on Tuesday. President Trump carried the district by 13 percentage points in 2016, while losing Washington as a whole, but his divisive brand of politics has not been considered helpful to Ms. Rodgers, making her district part of a huge swath of the nation — the entire Pacific Coast, much of the Northeast and large interior cities like Chicago and Minneapolis — where Republican lawmakers do not want to be seen with him. Early voting patterns suggest that both sides are energized, said Ben Stuckart, the Spokane City Council president, who supports Ms. Brown. ""The more solid D's are turning out high and the more solid R's are turning out high, which kind of goes to the hardening of divisions,"" he said. There's a history in the district of tossing out veteran politicians in favor of new blood. Mr. Foley famously lost his seat in the House in 1994 — the first sitting House speaker to lose his district since the mid-1800s. But the dynamic is different this time because both women have long political records — Ms. Brown in the state legislature, Ms. Rodgers in Congress — that can be bragged about, or attacked by the other side. Scanning a map, the Eighth District looks like it could be one of those gerrymandered snake districts, winding around to find certain kinds of voters. But the reality is that by winding through central Washington, the district captures much of the demographic drama that rolls through the Pacific Northwest in general. It has affluent Democratic-leaning voters from the techie eastern suburbs of Seattle, union workers from Boeing around the company's huge airplane factory in Renton, and conservative farmers and retirees to the east, many of whom have left the bigger coastal cities. As a measure of its divisions, the Eighth has a higher percentage of foreign-born residents than the state as a whole, many of them agricultural workers in the fruit industry, but also more rich people, with a higher percentage of households earning more than $200,000 than the state as a whole, according to the census. Dino Rossi, a Republican who was almost elected governor in 2004 in one of the closest elections in state history (Christine Gregoire, a Democrat, won by 129 votes then beat Mr. Rossi again, more handily, in a rematch four years later) is facing Kim Schrier, a pediatrician and first-time candidate who has made health care her issue. They are competing to succeed Dave Reichert, a Republican, who is retiring. The district, historically Republican in Congress but won by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, is seen by both parties as the most likely of the state's three competitive seats to flip. But with the margin of victory expected to be tight whoever wins, voters have been pummeled by weeks of advertising in what has become one of the most expensive House races in the nation, with more than $26 million raised by candidates and outside groups. A voter-registration drive this fall on the campus of Central Washington University in Ellensburg, one of the district's biggest towns, might make a difference in a close race, said Ellensburg's mayor, Bruce Tabb. Or not. College students are inconsistent voters, at best. ""I've talked to students who seem to be more engaged,"" said Mr. Tabb, who has a nonpartisan office and has not endorsed either candidate. ""But it's a very, very challenging thing, I think, to actually determine what that impact is going to be."" A key thing to know about the Third District is that a significant chunk of it is actually part of the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area. While Portland is in another state, on the south bank of the Columbia River, and is famously liberal, the northern bank suburbs in the Third District, in and around Vancouver, Wash., in Clark County, are traditionally conservative. But Portland's little brother suburb has been growing up. ""Clark County is the housing pressure release valve for the tri-county Portland region,"" said Thomas Kimpel, a senior analyst at the Washington State Office of Financial Management, which prepares demographic and economic research. Vancouver was the fourth fastest growing city in the state over the last decade, partly from Portlanders crossing the river to find cheaper housing, or perhaps for the taxes. (Washington has no income tax.) The economy of the district has also moved away from its old base of timber, agriculture and shipping toward a more Portland-like economy of tech and services. Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler — a Republican and a protégée of Ms. Rodgers in the Fifth District, for whom she worked as a legislative aide before running for office herself — is facing Carolyn Long, an associate professor of politics, philosophy and public affairs at Washington State University Vancouver. Ms. Beutler only beat Ms. Long by about 7 percentage points in the August primary. The 2016 presidential election map provides another clue to the shifting dynamics in Washington State. All the counties won by Mrs. Clinton except two were clustered in the state's northwest corner, in Seattle and its neighboring counties. One of two Clinton outliers was Whitman County in Ms. Rodger's district — home to Washington State University. The other was Clark County, in Ms. Beutler's district."
News,2018-11-07,"In a week when Europe’s top soccer executives have hunkered down amid a wave of unprecedented leaks, the leader of Spain’s league took the opportunity to go on the attack.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/sports/soccer/la-liga-football-leaks-tebas.html,946," In a week when Europe's top soccer executives have hunkered down amid a wave of unprecedented leaks, the leader of Spain's league took the opportunity to go on the attack. Emboldened by recent leaks of documents that implicate Manchester City and Paris St.-Germain in possible attempts to obscure their spending and establish cozy relationships with soccer regulators, the La Liga president, Javier Tebas, said in an interview that the two clubs — and others that flout soccer financial rules — should face punishments that he says are long overdue. ""It was clear in the past that they were making dirty tricks; everything is crystal clear now,"" Tebas said of City and P.S.G., three days after the surfacing of leaked documents that appeared to confirm his long-held complaints the clubs had manipulated financial control measures. Still, Tebas said it was not clear either club would face sanctions, in part because of a tangled web of financial relationships that City, P.S.G. and European soccer's governing body, UEFA, have with financial powers in the Middle East. The royal family of the United Arab Emirates owns Manchester City, the reigning Premier League champion, and the sovereign wealth fund of the Qatari royal family owns both P.S.G. and beIN Sport, the network that has committed billions of dollars to televise the Champions League and other top competitions. That was why, Tebas said, UEFA has not acted to police violations. ""There's a conflict of interest,"" he said. Manchester City, P.S.G. and UEFA all declined requests for comment on Tebas's remarks. In other news reports, all three have described the recently leaked documents as malicious and have questioned their authenticity. European news organizations, led by Germany's Der Spiegel, began publishing a cache of internal documents Friday. The documents, the publication of which has rattled executives at the highest levels of the game, also detailed plans for a potential breakaway league featuring the sport's biggest teams — an effort that appears to be supported by Real Madrid's billionaire president, Florentino Pérez. Under one version of the so-called super league plan, more than a dozen of Europe's biggest teams would consider leaving their domestic competitions to play one another beginning in 2021. The clubs linked to the competition include two from La Liga (Real Madrid and Barcelona) but also Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Juventus — and Manchester City and P.S.G. Among the documents was a term sheet for a potential breakaway tournament produced by Key Capital Partners, the Madrid-based advisers to Real Madrid and Pérez's construction company, A.C.S. ""If these big European teams want to create a strategy to kill their own football fans, they can create a super league and they'll succeed in killing these fans within 10 years,"" Tebas said. Both P.S.G. and Manchester City have been sanctioned in the past over their spending, though UEFA has stopped short of handing down the harshest punishment — banning the teams from top competitions like the Champions League — though that fate has befallen other, less powerful institutions that breached the organization's Financial Fair Play rules. Other clubs have complained about what they see as unfair treatment. ""The FFP struggle is real for (some of us),"" the Italian team AS Roma tweeted in response to the leaks. UEFA is once again reviewing P.S.G's finances after its recent acquisitions of the Brazilian star Neymar and the French World Cup winner Kylian Mbappé; Neymar's purchase more than doubled the world transfer record, and Mbappé's move from Monaco made him the world's second-costliest player. P.S.G. is trying to block a new UEFA review of those deals through an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Tebas's charges of a conflict of interest were the most likely to drive a wedge between La Liga and beIN Sports, which owns the rights to Spanish soccer in multiple markets. But he dismissed any potential consequences for the league. ""If they're not willing to buy them we'll go somewhere else to sell them,"" Tebas said. ""The stability of professional football in Europe can't be bought by money."" UEFA's financial task force will hold its first meeting since the leaks on Wednesday. Tebas said he was planning to file a complaint with Europe's competition regulators if UEFA does not take action. But he may face questions of his own at home for his criticisms of Spain's domestic powers. The breakaway plan involving Europe's biggest clubs is something Pérez, the Real Madrid president, had been working on for years, Tebas added. Real didn't respond to a request for comment about Tebas's critique. Tebas and Real Madrid are locked in a separate battle over his plan to play an official league match in the United States, perhaps as early as this season. Tebas wants to use the match to raise the profile of the other teams in La Liga that are dwarfed by the popularity of Barcelona and Real Madrid. Barcelona is scheduled to play the first match against Girona on Jan. 26 in Miami, but players, unions, fans and — most important — the Spanish soccer federation all have objected to the idea. Without the federation's blessing, the game cannot be played. At a dinner last month, Tebas and Luis Rubiales, the Spanish federation's combative leader, failed to resolve the dispute. So Tebas said he was turning to the courts: La Liga plans to file a motion this week in Madrid to get the city's mercantile court to force the federation's hand. ""We think we have the right,"" Tebas said. Hours after he spoke on Monday, there was another leak, implicating more executives. ""They can hack me tomorrow if they want,"" he said. ""They won't find any dirty tricks in my emails."""
News,2018-11-07,"RICHMOND, Ky. — Representative Andy Barr, an incumbent Republican, defeated one of the Democratic Party’s most prominent challengers, Amy McGrath, on Tuesday in a deeply conservative district here, according to The Associated Press, giving his party hope of limiting losses in the race for control of the House.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/politics/andy-barr-amy-mcgrath-kentucky.html,753," RICHMOND, Ky. — Representative Andy Barr, an incumbent Republican, defeated one of the Democratic Party's most prominent challengers, Amy McGrath, on Tuesday in a deeply conservative district here, according to The Associated Press, giving his party hope of limiting losses in the race for control of the House. The contest took on national importance as a proxy for whether Democrats could win over white working class voters in rural areas and whether women would rise up against the barbed-wire rhetoric and harsh policies of the Trump presidency. It was among about 30 tossup districts, including many, like Mr. Barr's, where Republicans held a distinct partisan advantage. Public polling seesawed between a Republican lead and a Democratic lead, ending this week in an exact tie. Mr. Barr's victory on Tuesday signaled that Republican-controlled districts were still asserting their allegiance to the president, and may have been swayed by the issue of immigration and the Supreme Court nomination fight over Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. [See the results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors' races, and read our analysis.] See live U.S. House results and maps. Mr. Barr tethered himself closely to the president and to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, as he cast Ms. McGrath as an unreconstructed liberal in the mold of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who was for open borders and abortions as late as the ninth month of pregnancy. He was aided by millions of dollars of spending on attack ads against Ms. McGrath funded by the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC supported by Speaker Paul D. Ryan whose largest contributor is the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Ms. McGrath refused to respond with her own attack ads, instead choosing to mock Mr. Barr, often with the tagline, ""Is that all you got?"" Mr. Barr is well known in the district for attending all manner of local festivals and delivering on legislation that affects the area. But he found himself on the defensive over tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump that hurt the local bourbon and automotive industries along with soybean farmers. In the closing weeks of the campaign, he returned to themes that echoed the ones that Mr. Trump was emphasizing. The president had put his personal popularity on the line in the race, recently coming to campaign for Mr. Barr one day after former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. came to Owingsville, Ky., a rural part of the district, to support Ms. McGrath and to emphasize his party's need to reconnect with the white working class. In Ms. McGrath, whose biography as a Marine aviator gave her star power and a huge fund-raising advantage, Mr. Barr found himself running against a résumé that he could not match. So he emphasized his conservative ideology, and prevailed. [Make sense of the country's political landscape with our newsletter.] The district is anchored in Lexington, its most populous city by far and typically a Democratic stronghold, and the state capital of Frankfurt, another source of Democratic votes. But those cities are surrounded by mostly rural counties that are ardently conservative. In 2016, Mr. Trump won the district by 15 percentage points and Mr. Barr won by 22 points. Ms. McGrath's campaign opened campaign offices in all 19 counties, and she aggressively targeted rural areas, with yard signs tailored to individual counties, some even in Republican red, and by writing op-eds that her campaign placed in weekly newspapers. That strategy served her well in her primary campaign against Jim Gray, the popular mayor of Lexington, who was better known and had stronger financial backing. But she defeated Mr. Gray easily, and built on her strengths in rural areas during the fall campaign against Mr. Barr, pulling votes from people who were ancestral Democrats but vote for Republicans in federal office. [Follow our live briefing for the latest election updates.] Ms. McGrath started out underfinanced, but her campaign money fortunes changed drastically in August 2017 when she released a two-minute video online that captured her Marine combat experience, the struggles of women and her reasons for running for office. The ad generated millions of page views and contributions, enabling her to have rough parity with Mr. Gray, and then build on an emerging national profile. ""The video catapulted her to legitimacy,"" Mark Nickolas, Ms. McGrath's campaign manager, said. But it was not enough to overcome the power of Mr. Barr's incumbency, a district that was structurally advantageous to Republicans and the closing moves of the president to roust his political base and make the election a referendum on him."

The prize constitutes a cash award of $50,000. Shannon R. Stratton, the museum's chief curator, explained in a phone interview that the concept behind the prize is to show ""what craft might be in 2018 and beyond."" The financial element, she said, comes from a desire by the museum to support early-career artists who make up ""the changing face of what is perceived as craft in the United States."" The prize was endowed by Marian Burke, a trustee of the museum, and her husband, Russell Burke, and is to be awarded annually. It is aimed at artists under the age of 46 whose primary medium is glass, fiber, clay, metal or wood. Mr. Luger is a New Mexico-based artist who was raised on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. His work addresses environmental matters and issues of violence against indigenous populations, especially those who identify as female, queer or transgender. ""Cannupa Hanska Luger exemplifies craft as connected to the past as much as to the future,"" Namita Gupta Wiggers, a contemporary craft curator and one of the jurors who selected Mr. Luger, said in a statement. In addition to Ms. Wiggers, the jurors who selected Mr. Luger for the 2018 prize were Michael Radyk, the director of education for the American Craft Council and Jenni Sorkin, a professor of contemporary art history at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Next year, Mr. Luger will be on the jury, and each subsequent year's winner will be invited to return as a juror the year after they win. Some of Mr. Luger's work, along with work by other award finalists, is on display at the museum as part of the exhibition ""The Burke Prize 2018: The Future of Craft Part 2.""

News,2018-11-07,OTTAWA — A former cabinet minister and current member of Parliament was asked to leave the Conservative caucus on Wednesday after acknowledging he had sent sexually explicit photographs and a video to a woman over a three-week period.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/world/canada/tony-clement-resigns.html,663," OTTAWA — A former cabinet minister and current member of Parliament was asked to leave the Conservative caucus on Wednesday after acknowledging he had sent sexually explicit photographs and a video to a woman over a three-week period. Tony Clement, the ex-minister who twice ran for the leadership of the Conservatives, said in a statement on Tuesday night that he had believed the recipient was ""consenting."" But he said, without offering details, that he had ""been targeted for the purpose of financial extortion."" Shortly afterward, Mr. Clement resigned from several parliamentary posts, including a spot on a committee with access to national security intelligence. But on Wednesday afternoon, the leader of the Conservatives, Andrew Scheer, asked him to leave the caucus as well. ""I took him at his word that this was an isolated incident,"" Mr. Scheer told reporters. ""Since then, there have been numerous reports of other incidents, allegations."" Mr. Scheer did not offer any details about those reports. But several women posted messages on social media about online encounters with Mr. Clement that had left them uneasy. None mentioned receiving lewd images. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Scheer said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were investigating Mr. Clement's accusation of extortion. He said the national police force and the security section of the Privy Council Office, which runs the machinery of government, were also looking into the possibility of national security breaches. Mr. Clement, 57, had said on Tuesday night that he would retain his seat in Parliament, but he made no comment after he was removed from the caucus on Wednesday. ""I recognize now that I have gone down a wrong path and have exercised very poor judgment,"" Mr. Clement said in his statement on Tuesday. ""I apologize to my family for the needless pain and humiliation my actions have caused. I also apologize to my colleagues and my constituents for letting them down."" Mr. Clement said he would seek unspecified ""help and treatment"" and asked that his privacy be respected. The accusations against Mr. Clement could prove embarrassing to Mr. Scheer, a social conservative who has opposed same-sex marriage and abortion rights. Until Tuesday, Mr. Clement enjoyed a high profile as the Conservatives' spokesman on justice issues. But after his admission on Tuesday, concern focused on his role as a member of a relatively new committee that oversees the work of Canada's intelligence agencies as well as the intelligence operations of the mounted police. Made up of members of both the House of Commons and the Senate, the committee has wide access to the inner workings of those agencies as well as their most closely held secrets. Other members of the committee declined to comment to reporters on Wednesday, as did Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Compared with many Canadian politicians, Mr. Clement was an early adopter and avid user of social media, particularly Twitter and Instagram. Unusually, Mr. Clement has not posted any new tweets since Oct. 31. Mr. Clement, who is married to Lynne Golding, a prominent Toronto lawyer, first rose to prominence in a right-of-center Progressive Conservative government in Ontario in which he held several cabinet positions, including health minister. His initial bid to be elected to the federal House of Commons in suburban Toronto failed. In 2006, after moving to a district in a popular vacation area north of Toronto, Mr. Clement won his seat by a 28-vote margin. While the Conservatives were in power, Mr. Clement held four different cabinet posts, again including that of health minister. In 2010, while serving as industry minister, Mr. Clement misspoke to a group of people from the telecommunications industry, saying that Canada needed more ""sex stories,"" rather than success stories. That same year he came under criticism when millions of dollars in government money was spent in his electoral district in advance of a Group of 8 summit meeting. An Olympic-sized ice rink appeared, along with public washrooms, statues, gazebos and flower boxes, far from anywhere the world's leaders would visit."
News,2018-11-07,"Democrats wrested control of governorships from Republicans in seven states on Tuesday including Wisconsin, where they ousted Scott Walker after eight tumultuous years as the state’s chief executive, and Kansas, a surprise victory in a longtime Republican stronghold.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/us/politics/governors-midterms-florida-kansas-kobach.html,1653," Democrats wrested control of governorships from Republicans in seven states on Tuesday including Wisconsin, where they ousted Scott Walker after eight tumultuous years as the state's chief executive, and Kansas, a surprise victory in a longtime Republican stronghold. But Republicans fended off strong Democratic challenges to hold on to the governorships of Florida, Ohio and Iowa, maintaining their control of three states likely to be crucial in the 2020 presidential elections. The victories expanded the number of states with Democratic chief executives — an important consideration as legislatures begin the process of drawing congressional district lines. In addition to Kansas and Wisconsin, Democrats also picked up governor's seats in Nevada, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico and Maine. Still, the results reflected a night of mixed tidings for the party out of power, given that Democrats were hoping to install a rising young star in Florida and sweep the midwest states where President Trump forged the core of his unexpected victory two years ago. [See the results for the elections for governor nationwide.] The victory in Florida by Ron DeSantis, a Republican supporter of President Trump, turned back the historic effort by Andrew Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor, who was seeking to become the first African-American governor of his state. Republicans took another important battleground state with a victory in Ohio by Mike DeWine, the attorney general, who defeated Richard Cordray, a Democrat and former federal regulator. And in Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, defeated Fred Hubbell, a Democrat and wealthy businessman, in a tossup contest that had hinged on local issues including the state's health care system and its economy. The biggest defeat for Republicans was in Wisconsin. Mr. Walker, a onetime rising party star and short-lived presidential candidate, was seeking a third term in a state that unexpectedly flipped to Mr. Trump in 2016. The showing gave hope to Democrats eager to win the state back in 2020. Mr. Walker fell to Tony Evers, a Democrat and the state schools superintendent. As in other Midwestern states, Democrats ran against Mr. Walker and the Republican establishment rather than against Mr. Trump. [Make sense of the country's political landscape with our newsletter.] The loss in Kansas by Kris Kobach, a deeply conservative secretary of state and also a staunch ally of Mr. Trump, was also a big setback for the party in one of the most conservative regions in the country. He was beaten by Laura Kelly, a Democratic member of the Kansas Senate. In Nevada Steve Silosak, a Democratic businessman, defeated Adam Laxalt, the Republican attorney general, a victory that underlined the extent to which the state has been edging into the Democratic column — Hillary Clinton defeated Mr. Trump there in 2016, and Jacky Rosen, a Democrat, unseated an incumbent Republican senator, Dean Heller, on Tuesday night. It also reflects what analysts view as the rising power of Latino voters in the state. Mr. Trump notably did not campaign in Nevada during the final weeks leading to the vote, a time when he was stressing what he described as the threat of illegal immigration Democrats also captured Republican-held gubernatorial seats in two key Midwestern states, Illinois and Michigan. J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune, defeated Bruce Rauner, who has been governor of Illinois since 2015, and Gretchen Whitmer, a former member of the Michigan state legislature, defeated Bill Schuette, the Republican attorney general who also ran with the support of Mr. Trump. In Colorado, Jared Polis, a Democratic member of Congress, became the first openly gay man elected governor, defeating Walker Stapleton, a Republican and the state treasurer. Christine Hallquist of Vermont failed in her bid to become the first transgender governor in the nation, as Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, handily turned back her challenge and captured a second term as the state's chief executive. And in California, Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor, easily won election over John Cox, a Republican businessman, inheriting the mantle of Gov. Jerry Brown as the leader of arguably the most Democratic state in the country. Mr. Newsom loped to an easy victory, riding the overwhelmingly Democratic edge in the state but also the strong opposition to Mr. Trump. The president endorsed Mr. Cox in the primary. The contests for governor were, to a considerable extent, overshadowed by the battle for control of Congress during this contentious election season. But along with the battle to control state legislatures, they could prove significant in setting the nation's political landscape for the next decade. This new class of governors will take office as states prepare for the highly partisan process of drawing congressional and legislative districts. Republicans seized power in states across the nation in 2010, in the first midterm election of the presidency of Barack Obama, which put them in a position to use the redistricting process to cement their majority in Congress. The battle between Mr. Gillum and Mr. DeSantis was one of the most closely watched, in part because of the racial overtones that marked the campaign. Mr. DeSantis, who is white, squeaked out a victory after spending weeks addressing questions about his past political associations with racists and xenophobes. Mr. Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor, whose administration was under federal investigation for corruption, was repeatedly accused by Mr. DeSantis of financial impropriety. Mr. Trump was an early supporter of Mr. DeSantis, who defended the president on television and modeled his candidacy after the president's. And Mr. Trump returned the favor, heading to Florida to campaign on his behalf. Heading into Tuesday's election, Republicans controlled 33 governor seats, compared with 16 held by Democrats. (One is an independent). There were 26 Republican-held seats on the ballot Tuesday and nine Democratic seats. One of the most closely watched races in the nation was unresolved early in the morning. In Georgia, Brian Kemp, the Republican secretary of state, held a slight lead over Stacey Abrams, who was trying to become the first African-American woman elected governor in any state. Addressing supporters early Wednesday, she said she wanted all ballots counted and suggested the campaign may go to a runoff. In Kansas, Mr. Kobach is best known for his hard-line views on immigration and voting rights, and his candidacy was considered problematic by both national and state party leaders, who worried that he was too extreme to win a general election. Nevertheless, he was a close ally of Mr. Trump, and the president endorsed him in the days before the primary last summer. ""Today, Kansans voted for change,"" Ms. Kelly said as she declared victory in Topeka. ""Change not only in the direction of our state, but a change in the tone of our state."" In addition to Ms. Whitmer, another up-and-coming Democratic moderate, Gina Raimondo, held on to her governor's seat in Rhode Island, beating her Republican challenger, Allan Fung. Voters in New Mexico elected the state's first Democratic Latina governor, Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump's immigration policies. She defeated Representative Steve Pearce, a member of the Republican House Freedom Caucus. Democrats have not held the statehouse in New Mexico since 2010. Democrats also held on to several governorships in several states where they were heavily favored — Andrew Cuomo in New York, Tom Wolf in Pennsylvania and Tim Walz in Minnesota. Republicans kept seats in solidly red states including Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas, Arizona, Nebraska, South Carolina and Wyoming. Three moderate G.O.P. governors, Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, Larry Hogan in Maryland and Mr. Scott in Vermont, also kept their seats. Ms. Whitmer and Ms. Raimondo represent a class of younger — and energetic — Democratic leaders who, with this election, have emerged at a time when the party is debating not only what its ideology should be, but which lawmakers should lead it. Ms. Whitmer will replace Rick Snyder, a Republican who was elected governor of Michigan in 2010. A former venture-capital executive who won her first term for governor in 2014, Ms. Raimondo has been criticized for not doing enough to combat Rhode Island's lackluster economy. She has also faced lingering bitterness from some of the state's unions over her role in overhauling the pension system years ago when she was the treasurer. But on the national stage, she is well respected by high-ranking Democrats — she was among those reportedly considered as a possible running mate to Hillary Clinton — and serves as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association, which focuses on electing state executives. Mr. Cordray's loss in Ohio deepened the Democratic Party's concerns that the once-purple state has become irreversibly red. The Democratic Party had bet that a focus on lunch-pail issues could appeal to liberals and minority voters, as well the white working-class voters who had overwhelmingly swung to Mr. Trump. But Mr. DeWine's victory — driven perhaps by the popularity of the departing Republican governor, John Kasich — and the appearance of Mr. Trump at a rally in Cleveland on Monday, suggests that the reddening seen in 2016 could be more a new standard than an anomaly. Mr. Cordray was gracious as he addressed subdued supporters at a hotel in downtown Columbus. He congratulated Mr. DeWine and expressed hope that the governor-elect would bring the state together after a campaign that had at times turned sour. ""Mike has always been a dedicated public servant,"" Mr. Cordray said, ""and I hope he will be a governor who looks out for all Ohioans — as much for the Ohioans who voted for me as for the Ohioans who voted for him."" In Tennessee, where most of the political energy was focused on the state's Senate race, Bill Lee, a Republican, defeated Karl Dean, a Democratic former mayor of Nashville, in the race to succeed Gov. Bill Haslam. Mr. Haslam, a Republican who faced term limits and chose not to run for the Senate seat, was seen as a moderating force in the Tennessee capital."
News,2018-11-07,"It’s been years in the making, if not decades: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democratic Party seized complete control of the New York State government on Tuesday, decisively evicting Republicans from running the State Senate, which they have controlled for all but three years since World War II.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/nyregion/democrats-ny-albany-cuomo-senate.html,1283," It's been years in the making, if not decades: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democratic Party seized complete control of the New York State government on Tuesday, decisively evicting Republicans from running the State Senate, which they have controlled for all but three years since World War II. Now Democrats have to figure out just what to do with that newfound power — and almost everyone has different ideas and priorities, some of which had already started to collide on Wednesday, even as Mr. Cuomo and his Democratic colleagues celebrated major wins. Democrats now hold 40 seats in the State Senate, as Republicans lost eight to the Democrats on Election Day. That count, however, includes Senator Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, who has previously caucused with Republicans. Mr. Cuomo, meanwhile, won with 59 percent of the vote — some 3.4 million people chose him for a third term — a marked improvement from his 2014 victory, and one that left the governor sounding deeply satisfied. When asked on Wednesday what he would like to see passed in the coming legislative session, the governor laid out a veritable Christmas list of progressive baubles, including codifying Roe v. Wade's protections in state law; more gun control and ethics laws; the Dream Act, which would allow for financial aid for undocumented students; and the Child Victims Act, which would extend the statute of limitations for survivors of certain kinds of sexual abuse. Perhaps most notably, Mr. Cuomo said he would close the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which allows almost unlimited amounts of cash to flow to campaigns — including his own — through multiple limited liability companies. Mr. Cuomo had worked closely with Republicans and a breakaway group of Democrats during his seven-plus years in office, much to the chagrin of more left-leaning members of his party, who blamed those relationships for bottling up the very legislation he now wants to pass. And in describing his feelings on Wednesday, the governor sounded relieved that he would stop being blamed. ""My great frustration has been the inability to pass progressive measures that would have made a significant positive difference for the state and, as governor, bearing the burden of the failure of their passage,"" Mr. Cuomo said in an interview on Wednesday. ""The Democratic Senate will liberate me from that frustration."" Still there will most be a push for even more: There is already chatter about legalizing recreational marijuana; investing more in the crumbling subways; addressing climate change; and installing an early voting system for the first time, all ideas that the governor has previously offered differing degrees of support for. And after a tumultuous primary season in which liberal challengers ousted seven more moderate Democratic state senators, the virtual Holy Grail of current progressive thought seems within reach: a state-run universal health care system. Mr. Cuomo stopped short of fully embracing the proposal, saying it ""has merit."" Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who is slated to become the first woman and first female African-American to lead the New York State Senate, also struck a note of caution about the Democratic agenda. ""You eat the elephant one issue at a time,"" she said on Tuesday, as votes began to roll in for her party. There also will likely be, of course, intraparty differences. The Senate that Ms. Stewart-Cousins will lead is very likely to contain several factions, including New York City liberals and more moderate members from the city's suburbs. Fifteen of her members will be new to Albany, and its vagaries, with many of that cohort never before having held public office — or, in some cases, even having an office. [What drove the rogue group of Senate Democrats to work with Republicans? Read more here.] Gustavo Rivera, a Democratic state senator from the Bronx, said that Democrats had failed to keep the trust of voters during their brief time in charge nearly a decade ago and know they must do better this time. ""Governing is a very complicated matter,"" Mr. Rivera said. ""It's not just giving raises to your staff and getting nicer offices."" For many, the scars from that brief 2009-10 period of Democratic rule are still fresh. It was a tumultuous time marked by ugly legislative high jinks, warring factions and, the former Democratic leader eventually getting sent to prison. Mr. Cuomo won in 2010, in part, on a promise to restore sanity and stability to the statehouse. And he did so by occupying the political center between a liberal State Assembly and a Republican-controlled State Senate. For years, he has blamed any number of stalled liberal goals on recalcitrant Republicans. That catchall excuse dissolved Tuesday evening. Alessandra Biaggi, who defeated Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of the breakaway Democrats, said of Mr. Cuomo, ""Now it's up to us to actually hold him accountable and to make sure that the things that he says are not just campaign promises."" Much of the to-do list that Mr. Cuomo discussed after the election involved social or legal changes. But the governor has generally been more leery of raising taxes and other measures that would negatively affect the business community; real estate interests pour millions of dollars into his campaigns and drive a large segment of the city's and state's economy. Mayor Bill de Blasio has repeatedly called for a new millionaire's tax to fund various programs; Mr. Cuomo has steadfastly opposed it. The last time Democrats controlled the full Legislature, they raised taxes only to see themselves lose back the Senate within two years. ""This scary narrative about tax-and-spend-Democrats will not pertain to us,"" said Ms. Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester Democrat. ""It does not pertain to us."" One big issue sure to come up in 2019 is expanding rent control, as the current rules are set to expire. State Senator Brian P. Kavanagh, a Democrat from Manhattan elected in 2017, predicted ""a fundamentally different debate about the relationship between landlords and tenants"" than in the past. The governor has also signaled he wants to push a congestion-pricing plan to boost funding for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway system. ""How are we going to fix the M.T.A.? We have got to do this,"" Ms. Biaggi said. ""This is insane. Enough now. I don't think anyone wants to hear any more excuses."" Mr. Cuomo has previously feuded with state Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, who runs the political operation of Senate Democrats. Even some of the governor's allies were perplexed by an October news release from the state party, which Mr. Cuomo controls, that contrasted his efforts with those of Mr. Gianaris. ""Fund-raising Effort Follows News That D.S.C.C. is Losing Money Race,"" the release blared. (Mr. Gianaris runs the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.) Ms. Stewart-Cousins said, ""I thought that was an unfortunate press release, frankly, and I made sure that the state party chair was aware of that."" And on Wednesday, there were hints of friction there again as Mr. Gianaris said he had been kept in the dark about a possible deal to place a satellite headquarters of Amazon in Long Island City, which is the heart of his district. Mr. Cuomo has openly lobbied for Amazon to come to New York, joking he would even change his name to ""Amazon Cuomo"" to land the company. Mr. Gianaris, however, has expressed deep concerns about infrastructure, overcrowding and the wisdom of using subsidies to lure ""one of the richest companies in the world."" ""There's all sorts of red flags,"" he said. ""And I don't have any answers."" Still, Mr. Gianaris, who helped orchestrate the Democrats' big night on Tuesday, also seemed eager to keep the peace. ""This is a not a complaint that I wasn't briefed properly,"" he said."

Sign up here. Democrats have reclaimed the House, while Republicans extended control in the Senate. That spells gridlock — and investors are fine with it. As Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer of Cresset Wealth Advisors, told CNBC, ""History has shown that the mixed party control is generally the best combination."" U.S. market futures were up slightly this morning, as were international stock indexes. The dollar declined, partly on the diminished prospect of further economic stimulus like another tax cut. Michael McKenzie of the FT says that the trend could continue, as ""the election result seems likely to produce a softer dollar and steady bond yields, which will help"" the markets. Now, investors will turn their attention to other issues, including the Fed's monetary policy and the U.S.-China trade battle. Now that Democrats control the House, they will start trying to curb President Trump's agenda. Less clear is what they can achieve. First on the agenda is likely to be an array of investigations. Politico notes that Democratic lawmakers already have a list of subpoenas and document requests. Other officials, like New York State's new attorney general, have pledged to investigate Mr. Trump's business dealings and, potentially, his tax returns. House Democrats will also have more power to stymie Mr. Trump. Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, is expected to retake the speakership, while outspoken critics of the administration like Representative Maxine Waters, a skeptic of banking deregulation, are set to assume control of major committees. But there are limits. Democrats cannot force an end to Mr. Trump's trade fight with China, nor can they block judicial nominees. And Ms. Pelosi is unlikely to pursue impeachment proceedings. They are likely to work with the president on infrastructure spending and lower drug prices. ""Everybody understands that we have to choose our battles very carefully now,"" Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, told the NYT. So far, Quartz noted, the elections have led to: • More than 100 women in the House • The first Muslim women in Congress • The first Native American women in Congress • The youngest women in Congress • The first openly gay person elected as governor But Bloomberg argues that such records are important only if the new officials can stay long enough to effect real change. For now, election officials and social media companies are breathing a sigh of relief. At a news conference yesterday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said there was ""no indication of compromise to our nation's election infrastructure that would prevent voting, change vote counts or distrust the ability to tally votes."" Facebook said that it had shut down more accounts that it believed were spreading misinformation. It also said it had acted against some inaccurate voting information. (Accounts shut down on Monday are said to have been linked to a Kremlin-backed group of internet trolls.) But in general, the day bore no huge drama: ""We haven't seen anything unexpected,"" a Facebook representative told the BBC. But reports of meddling could yet come to light. ""I remain convinced that the real action will be after the election when we start to see the voter fraud, hacking claims start to roll in,"" Bret Schafer of the Alliance for Securing Democracy told the BBC.

But Democratic control of the House looks to give Beijing only a marginal increase in negotiating leverage. The results are unlikely to soften the U.S.-China trade war. Speaking at Bloomberg's New Economy Forum in Singapore this week, Gary Cohn, President Trump's former economic adviser, said: ""I wish that I could sit here and say, 'After the midterm elections, the White House and the administration understand they've got to solve trade issues.'""

The quest has gotten Amazon both lots of publicity and the offer of some fantastic financial benefits.

News,2018-11-07,"WASHINGTON — President Trump threatened on Wednesday to adopt a “warlike posture” against Democrats if they use their newly won control of the House to investigate his financial and political dealings, drawing a line at the start of a new era of divided government.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/trump-midterms-house-senate.html,1719," WASHINGTON — President Trump threatened on Wednesday to adopt a ""warlike posture"" against Democrats if they use their newly won control of the House to investigate his financial and political dealings, drawing a line at the start of a new era of divided government. The president began a postelection news conference with an offer to work across party lines, but his conciliatory tone quickly turned contentious. And barely an hour later, he announced the firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions in defiance of Democrats who saw an effort to impede the Russia investigation. House Democrats also made the traditional nod to bipartisanship after their victory in Tuesday's midterm elections even as they emphasized that they would scrutinize everything from Mr. Trump's taxes to his campaign's ties to Russia in 2016. But after Mr. Sessions was fired, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said the decision would be investigated once Democrats took over in January. [Read the latest on Jeff Sessions's resignation.] The instant exchange of fire indicated that there may be no lull in the conflict that has cleaved Washington during the Trump era, and if anything, it may escalate beyond what the last two years have brought. Once in control of all the levers of power in the capital, the president and his party now face the prospect of an opposition House armed with subpoena power and stocked by Democrats who won office on the promise of imposing a check on him. Any talk of lowering the temperature after a harsh campaign seemed to dissipate as the president angrily scolded reporters whose questions or behavior he did not like. By the end of the day, the White House suspended the credentials of Jim Acosta of CNN, a move that other presidents did not take even during times of great tension with the news media. Democrats picked up at least 27 seats in the House on Tuesday, with 17 still undecided, and claimed seven additional governorships in places like Wisconsin, Michigan and Kansas, states that Mr. Trump won two years ago and will be crucial to his chances of re-election in 2020. But he claimed a ""great victory"" because Republicans held on to the Senate and even knocked off Democratic incumbents in Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri, while losing only one of their own seats in Nevada. If they hold on to their current leads, Republicans will increase their majority to 54 seats from 51, giving them more maneuvering room as they confirm judges and other appointments by Mr. Trump. Although the balance of power in Congress was no longer in doubt, some key contests remained in flux. In Florida, Senator Bill Nelson, the Democrat, trailing by more than 30,000 votes, called for a recount, an idea dismissed as ""sad"" by his Republican opponent, Gov. Rick Scott. In Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat, trailed Martha McSally, the Republican, by more than 15,000 votes in a race. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams, a Democrat who is trying to become the nation's first black female governor, had not conceded her race against Brian Kemp, the Republican, in a race shadowed by concerns over voter suppression. Democrats did find good news in Montana, where Senator Jon Tester narrowly won re-election against Matt Rosendale, the Republican challenger backed by Mr. Trump in repeated rallies late in the campaign. At his news conference, Mr. Trump seemed to be trying to adjust to the new reality in Washington. ""I would like to see bipartisanship. I'd like to see unity,"" he said. But he said he would not tolerate investigations and would use allies in the Senate to open inquiries against Democrats in response: ""If that happens, then we're going to do the same thing, and government comes to a halt. And I would blame them."" Mr. Trump was the fourth president in a row to endure a major midterm election defeat. Mr. Trump's tone, however, was strikingly different from that of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who all expressed degrees of humility after major midterm losses in 1994, 2006 and 2010. Mr. Bush called his setback a ""thumping,"" and Mr. Obama described his as a ""shellacking,"" but Mr. Trump maintained that he had nothing to regret. He lost fewer seats in the House than Mr. Obama did and unlike his predecessor picked up Senate seats, he noted. The lesson he said he took from the election was validation. ""I think people like me,"" the president said. ""I think people like the job I'm doing, frankly."" The candidates he helped ended up winning, he said, and those who lost went down because they distanced themselves from him. ""Mia Love gave me no love,"" Mr. Trump said of a Republican congresswoman from Utah. ""And she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia."" He singled out other Republicans who lost because, he said, they did not embrace him. ""Didn't want the embrace,"" he said repeatedly. One Republican Mr. Trump did embrace on Wednesday was Vice President Mike Pence. Asked if he would commit to keeping Mr. Pence on the ticket in 2020, the president said, ""Well, I haven't asked him, but I hope so."" Then, spotting Mr. Pence in the audience, he said, ""Mike, will you be my running mate?"" Mr. Pence stood up and nodded that he would. Turning back to the reporter, Mr. Trump said, ""The answer is yes, O.K.? The turnover in the House foreshadowed a sharp change in Mr. Trump's presidency. A Democratic House not only can block Mr. Trump's priorities like building a wall along the southern border and repealing Mr. Obama's health care program, but it also can use subpoena power to investigate all manner of issues that he had been protected from until now. Among other things, Democrats are likely to demand the release of tax returns that he has kept secret, look into his business dealings and reopen the House investigation into any ties between Mr. Trump's team and Russia during the 2016 election. ""The American people will see his tax returns, not because of any voyeuristic interest, but because they should know if he is corrupt,"" Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on NBC News. ""And we will look at the cashing in of access to the Oval Office and that has been concerning and his financial entanglements overseas."" After Mr. Sessions was fired later in the day, Representatives Jerry Nadler of New York and Adam Schiff of California, the incoming chairmen of the judiciary and intelligence committees, vowed to take action. ""The firing of Jeff Sessions will be investigated and people will be held accountable,"" Mr. Nadler said. ""If the president seeks to interfere in the impartial administration of justice, the Congress must stop him,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""No one is above the law."" Mr. Trump opened his news conference with an embrace of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, and endorsed her bid to regain the speakership that she lost eight years ago. He even suggested that it may be better for him that Democrats won the House because he can make deals with them, while legislating with a narrower Republican majority might have been more difficult. ""There are many things we can get along on without a lot of trouble, that we agree very much with them and they agree with us,"" Mr. Trump said, citing health care, pharmaceutical drug prices, the environment and infrastructure. ""I would like to see bipartisanship. I'd like to see unity. Maybe not on everything, but I think we have a very good chance of seeing that."" Yet talk of compromise quickly turned to confrontation as he said he would fight fire with fire if Democrats follow through on their vows to use the subpoena power. ""They can play that game, but we can play better because we have a thing called the United States Senate and a lot of very questionable things were done, between leaks of classified information and many other elements that should not have taken place,"" he said. For her part, Ms. Pelosi said she hoped that this would be a ""new era"" and noted that she worked productively with Mr. Bush when Democrats held the House during his last two years in office. ""The fact is we'd like to work together so legislation would be bipartisan,"" she said. But Ms. Pelosi said Democrats would not curb their aspirations in the interest of compromise. ""We're not going for the lowest common denominator,"" she said. ""We're going for the boldest common denominator."" While he has presented himself as a natural negotiator from his time in real estate, Mr. Trump has made almost no deals with opposition Democrats since taking office. Mr. Trump had one brief moment of comity with Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, when they agreed to a short-term spending deal, but it quickly evaporated amid disagreement over immigration. The news conference, only his third formal solo session with reporters at the White House since he took office 22 months ago, showcased his toxic relationship with the news media. He complained repeatedly that he had been treated unfairly and engaged in several heated exchanges with reporters who questioned him. ""You're a very rude person,"" he told Mr. Acosta, the CNN reporter, who persisted in pressing him after the president was ready to move on and sought to keep a White House intern from taking the microphone away from him. When an NBC reporter stuck up for Mr. Acosta, Mr. Trump retorted, ""Well, I'm not a big fan of yours either."" He snapped at a third reporter who tried to ask a question. ""Sit down,"" he said. ""I didn't call you."" When a fourth reporter, who is black, asked if he had emboldened white supremacists by adopting the label ""nationalist"" during the campaign, he lashed out. ""That's such a racist question,"" he said, jabbing a finger at her. By the evening, the White House suspended Mr. Acosta's White House hard pass issued by the Secret Service granting journalists access to the building, falsely accusing him of ""placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern."" Reporters sitting nearby said that was an untrue characterization of what had happened."
News,2018-11-07,"SYDNEY — Li Ka-shing may be one of the most influential businessmen in Asia, but that reputation — and fear of Chinese influence — is working against his company’s ambitions to buy a critical gas operation in Australia.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/business/australia-ck-group-apa-group-li-ka-shing.html,615," SYDNEY — Li Ka-shing may be one of the most influential businessmen in Asia, but that reputation — and fear of Chinese influence — is working against his company's ambitions to buy a critical gas operation in Australia. The Australian government, seeking to balance national security interests and economic growth, said on Wednesday that it was likely to block CK Group, a company led by Mr. Li, a Hong Kong billionaire, from acquiring APA Group, the country's largest gas and pipeline company. A final decision is expected in two weeks, according to a Treasury statement. In February, Australia's Treasury announced it was tightening rules on investments in electricity and agriculture because of questions about China's influence on such deals. As much as $90 billion in Chinese investment has flowed to Australia since 2007. Australia's treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said his ""preliminary view"" of CK Group's bid of 12.98 billion Australian dollars ($9.6 billion) was to turn it down because it ""would be contrary to the national interest."" ""I have formed this view on the grounds that it would result in an undue concentration of foreign ownership by a single company group in our most significant gas transmission business,"" Mr. Frydenberg said in a statement. CK Group said in a separate statement that ""the preliminary view is not an adverse reflection on the CK Group, and that the Australian Government welcomes CK Group's investments in Australia and its broader contribution to the Australian economy."" Mr. Li's companies already have substantial interests in Australia, but their attempts at acquiring utilities have had mixed results. The Australian government cleared the group's takeover of gas and electricity distributor Duet Group in 2017; a year earlier it had blocked a joint bid for a state electricity distributor. This year, as the bid for the gas pipeline was under review and scrutiny over foreign acquisitions increased, CK Group attempted to allay concerns about the Chinese government's influence. Andy Hunter, CK's deputy chief executive, called the criticism and the concern about foreign investment as misinformed and disappointing. ""We are a properly governed, publicly-listed company and for anyone to suggest otherwise is sadly misinformed. The idea that we are in some way influenced by the Chinese government,"" Mr. Hunter told the Australian Financial Review in September, was ""fictitious to say the least."" The bid was cleared by the Australian competition watchdog but needed approval from by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Treasurer. The review board was unable to reach a unanimous recommendation, according to Mr. Frydenberg's statement. While the competition watchdog approved the bid, it hadn't considered ""the concentration of foreign ownership."" Mr. Frydenberg said that APA Group's size, which accounts for 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles) of pipelines, representing 56 percent of Australia's gas pipeline transmission system, was among his biggest concerns regarding the bid. The operation also includes three-quarters of all pipeline along the country's eastern coast. The news comes as the Australian government embarks on a campaign to revitalize relations with Beijing that have been strained since June when the government of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull passed national security legislation that bans foreign interference in politics. Government officials said at the time that the law was not aimed at any single country but the decision came months after newly released Australian electoral returns showed businesses with links to China had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to political parties in 2016. In August, the Australian government blocked Chinese technology giant Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE, from providing equipment to support the country's new telecommunications networks. Government ministers said at the time that companies that ""are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government"" posed unacceptable security risks."
Op-Ed,2018-11-07,"After Donald Trump won the election in 2016, he was in a position of great power to cut taxes, repeal Obamacare and build border walls to his heart’s content — if congressional Republicans cooperated. Of course, they didn’t always cooperate, but Mr. Trump was also able to push forward his agenda using the presidency’s unilateral powers — to deregulate, start trade wars and expel undocumented immigrants — and his power to appoint conservative judges with the consent of the Senate.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/midterms-democrats-house-trump.html,902," After Donald Trump won the election in 2016, he was in a position of great power to cut taxes, repeal Obamacare and build border walls to his heart's content — if congressional Republicans cooperated. Of course, they didn't always cooperate, but Mr. Trump was also able to push forward his agenda using the presidency's unilateral powers — to deregulate, start trade wars and expel undocumented immigrants — and his power to appoint conservative judges with the consent of the Senate. That was then. When newly elected members of Congress take their seats in January, creating a Democratic majority in the House, the president's power will shrink — not to nothing but significantly. The reason is not that a hostile Congress will block legislation that Mr. Trump seeks. Even without party control of both houses, many presidents employed their unilateral powers and skillful deal-making to score political victories. Ronald Reagan cut taxes, weakened regulations and negotiated historic nuclear arms reduction agreements with the Soviet Union. Bill Clinton pursued his New Democrat vision with a largely Republican-dominated Congress. George W. Bush's ""war on terror"" was almost entirely formulated by the executive branch. Barack Obama pursued several progressive measures — in the areas of immigration, affirmative action and campus speech — on his own. Nor is Mr. Trump's problem impeachment, at least, not in the short term. Removal requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate, and Republicans will almost certainly not oblige. No, Mr. Trump's power will shrivel for another reason: the interaction of congressional oversight and his chaotic, divisive and corrupt administration. Congress has so far used its oversight powers reluctantly. Republicans want to protect Mr. Trump, not embarrass him. That will change with Democratic control of the House. Committees will hold hearings on potential election collusion with Russia, of course, but also Mr. Trump's immigration enforcement policies, including family separation, his financial entanglements with the federal government, nepotism in the White House and allegations of corruption in the Trump Organization. Remember Whitewater? That single shady real estate transaction spawned a five-year investigation that consumed much of Mr. Clinton's presidency. President Trump and the Trump Organization have (or so it has been alleged) been involved in dozens if not hundreds of shady transactions. The parade of witnesses will be long. The president seems to expect his aides to corroborate the alternative reality he tweets out in the dead of morning, but they, not he, face perjury convictions if they do. Those witnesses will confirm accounts of dysfunction already leaked to the media, further damaging the president's standing. Congress will demand to see Mr. Trump's tax records and other financial documents. The bonanza of information will put him into jeopardy of further criminal investigation as well as civil lawsuits and, of course, bad press. The investigations will also clog the gears of his already notoriously inefficient administration. The subpoenas alone will sap resources and damage morale. While Mr. Trump can still push agencies to deregulate, hold the line on immigration enforcement, raise tariffs and tear up treaties, every action will invite a new congressional inquiry, along with a blizzard of subpoenas and another parade of witnesses if — as so often seems the case — it is accompanied by leaks that suggest procedural irregularity, internal disagreement or impropriety. The White House will fight back by claiming executive privilege. This hazy area of the law provides many opportunities for delay, confusion and conflict. But executive privilege cannot be used to disrupt investigations into criminal matters, and most presidents have felt constrained to allow inquiries into serious allegations of unethical conduct.  Will Mr. Trump? He could order his subordinates not to answer subpoenas. He could certainly get them to drag their feet. And while Congress could refer those officials to the Justice Department for prosecution for contempt, the department's longstanding policy is not to prosecute officials who keep silent based on executive privilege. But Congress can go directly to the courts to obtain a declaration that an official is in contempt, and — in extremis — arrest and detain him itself. This won't happen, but expect some tense moments. With or without executive-branch cooperation, Congress will uncover suspicious activities, which it will refer to the Justice Department. Attorney General Jeff Sessions (or his successor) will be pressured to appoint special counsels. These new Robert Muellers could generate new clashes with the president, whose distrust of the Justice Department will reach new heights. If Mr. Trump survives these conflicts, he will be badly wounded. Unless the Democrats rescue him. A premature impeachment inquiry could do just that. Bill Clinton's popularity soared after the Republicans' attempt to remove him from office blew up in their faces in 1999. No president has been pushed out of office except Richard Nixon, whose poll numbers languished in the 20s for months before his resignation and who finally lost the support of leading Republicans as well. Mr. Trump's numbers have stayed near or above 40 percent for most of his tenure, and he has a stranglehold on the Republican Party. In existential contests between Congress and the presidency, Congress can't win without overwhelming public support. The presidency enjoys too many inherent advantages over a clumsy multimember body that is deeply unpopular and divided with conflicts. Mr. Trump can't be defeated, not until 2020. But if Congress acts wisely, he can be constrained. Eric Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.

Op-Ed,2018-11-08,"Well, that was bittersweet.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/trump-midterms-sessions-russia.html,898," Well, that was bittersweet. I'm not sure I would call Tuesday's election results the blue wave many expected, but liberals absolutely made progress — and history — as Democrats assumed control of the House of Representatives, in part by electing a historic number of women to the body. Furthermore, the incredible diversity of the newly elected Democratic class offers a more comprehensive reflection of the current contours of the nation. But there was also heartbreak, as Republicans increased their margin in the Senate and some acclaimed liberal hopefuls in the South came close but fell short. That may temper excitement, but it shouldn't erase it. Whenever a chamber of Congress changes hands, it is a big deal. This is an even bigger deal, because it represents the first real legislative check on Donald Trump's power as president since he took office. Under Republicans, the House of Representatives made a mockery of its oversight responsibility, if not abandoned it altogether. Trump grew bolder and more brazen as he realized that there would be no political price to pay for his rhetoric and his actions. The Republican representatives were cowed before the pig. Democrats will now investigate and subpoena, which is a necessary and powerful function of the legislature. But it is also true that Trump sees part of the election outcome as a validation and an endorsement. The remaining Republicans in the House may be more Trump-friendly. Trump will no doubt see this all as encouragement to continue his racism, his attacks on the truth and on the press, and to expand his corruption. He has already moved to potentially change the infrastructure of the Russia investigation being conducted by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. On Wednesday, Trump requested the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and received it. Matthew Whitaker, Sessions's chief of staff, will replace him, at least on an acting basis. Before he became chief of staff last year, CNN described Mr. Whitaker this way: ""Matthew Whitaker is a CNN legal commentator and former U.S. attorney who directs the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), a conservative ethics watchdog group. He ran in the Republican primary for Iowa Senate in 2014."" In an article Mr. Whitaker wrote then for CNN under the headline ""Mueller's Investigation of Trump Is Going Too Far,"" he complained: It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump's finances or his family's finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else. That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel. In another part of the article Whitaker wrote: Any investigation into President Trump's finances or the finances of his family would require Mueller to return to Rod Rosenstein for additional authority under Mueller's appointment as special counsel. If he were to continue to investigate the financial relationships without a broadened scope in his appointment, then this would raise serious concerns that the special counsel's investigation was a mere witch hunt. If Mueller is indeed going down this path, Rosenstein should act to ensure the investigation is within its jurisdiction and within the authority of the original directive. It is unclear at this point how this staff change will affect Mueller and his investigation, now that oversight for his work is being taken away from Rosenstein. But there is no way to view this move and not worry about the future of the investigation. Trump now has at least two avenues to appoint a permanent successor to Jeff Sessions: Send a new nominee before a more favorable Senate with even more Republican votes, or make a recess appointment over the holidays. As Steve Vladeck pointed out last year in Slate: Article II, Section 2, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution empowers the president ""to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session."" And as the Supreme Court concluded three years ago in the Noel Canning case, ""the Recess of the Senate"" can include just about any formal recess that lasts 10 or more days — no matter whether it's an intersession or intrasession recess — and the vacancy at issue need not arise during the recess. (Both these holdings were over the nominal dissents of four of the more conservative justices.) As Vladeck explained, the Senate need only recess for 10 or more days with no formal business on the Senate floor — for the Christmas holidays, for instance — and ""Trump could simply recess-appoint whoever he wants to serve as attorney general until the end of the next Senate session."" In this case, that next session would end in January 2020. The incoming Democratic majority in the House would have absolutely no say in this. Democrats did well in the elections for the House in part because representation there is a reflection of where people are. The Senate, on the other hand, is tied to land. Indeed, the fewer people in these states, many of them solidly Republican, the more weight each person's vote carries. The Electoral College lives between the two equations. This, I believe, is why Trump focused his 11th-hour push on Senate races instead of House ones. Trump is solidifying power as a means of self-defense. Trump's strategy is to survive at all costs.

News,2018-11-08,SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon may not be the only technology giant considering a big expansion in New York.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/technology/google-expansion-new-york.html,678," SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon may not be the only technology giant considering a big expansion in New York. Google is in discussions to move into a planned 1.3 million square foot office complex at the St. John's Terminal building on Manhattan's West Side, according to a person with knowledge of the company's plans but not permitted to speak about it publicly. The property, which is expected to be completed in 2022, would allow the internet giant to significantly increase its presence in the city. Google employs around 7,000 in New York, and a space that size could allow it to more than double its local work force. The potential expansion, reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, comes on the heels of news that Amazon appears close to building a corporate office in the city. According to two people briefed on the negotiations, Amazon is close to naming Long Island City, a fast-growing neighborhood on the western edge of Queens, as one of two locations that would together house as many as 50,000 employees. Amazon's so-called HQ2 effort, a search for a second corporate headquarters outside of Seattle, has dragged on for about a year. Many were surprised when word leaked last week that the e-commerce company could end up with two new big offices instead of one. The other would be in Northern Virginia, outside of Washington. Amazon's potential arrival in Long Island City has some in the city hoping that New York could one day rival Silicon Valley as a tech hub. It has also raised concerns about whether the local infrastructure could handle such a rapid expansion. Google opened its first office in New York 18 years ago, but the company's ever-expanding work force has driven demand for larger offices and more staffing in the city. In March, Google spent $2.4 billion to buy the Chelsea Market building in Manhattan, where the company had set up some of its New York offices. The Chelsea office is Google's main workplace in the city, housing product and business teams for web search, ads and sales. A Google spokeswoman said it was also planning to add an additional 320,000 square feet of space with the redevelopment of Pier 57. The search for local real estate is part of a general expansion in the United States for Alphabet, Google's parent company. Last month, Alphabet said it had hired 9,000 employees in the United States this year, raising its total to 94,372 as of September. That was an increase of more than 16,000 from a year earlier. St. John's Terminal is being developed in Hudson Square by Oxford Properties, a Toronto-based developer. The 12-story building will incorporate a former freight terminal for the High Line and showcases rail beds as a central design feature. As tech companies expand in New York, they are likely to compete with Wall Street for engineering talent. New York has always had a significant technology industry of its own, though it has been dwarfed by the financial industry. For years, the city has ranked second or third among communities in the United States in total tech venture capital investment — with Silicon Valley and its surrounding area far and away the leader. New York's technology work force is also among the nation's largest, with many computer engineers working on the enormous data systems that power big financial institutions. Roughly 25 percent of Goldman Sachs's work force, for example, is dedicated to technology tasks, according to reports. Facebook also has a big office in New York, as do many other Silicon Valley companies. One of Microsoft's most important research labs is in the city. And some of the industry's most advanced research in complex and superfast computing systems is being done in New York, largely because of work with the big banks. But one thing the city has not been able to claim in a long time is a technology powerhouse of its own. The closest home of a tech heavyweight is Armonk, N.Y, about 40 miles away, where IBM is based. (IBM also has major offices in Manhattan.)"
briefing,2018-11-08,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/briefing/jeff-sessions-italy-russia.html,1386," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. A resignation in Washington, a growing gun culture in Italy and anger over collapsed buildings in France. Here's the latest: • ""Dear Mr. President, at your request I am submitting my resignation."" President Trump removed Attorney General Jeff Sessions, above, an effective implementer of his agenda who became a punching bag after recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Matthew Whitaker, Mr. Sessions's chief of staff and a Trump loyalist, will become acting attorney general — and will oversee the investigation, whose scope he has criticized as verging on a ""witch hunt."" Senior officials in the Justice Department are intensely suspicious of him, some seeing him as a White House spy. Mr. Whitaker has the power to block new moves by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and he could choose not to release the findings. The shake-up thus presents a stark challenge to the resolve of the new Democratic majority in the House, which will be seated in January. At a news conference in which he bickered with reporters, Mr. Trump offered to work with Democrats but threatened a ""warlike"" posture if they investigate him. Afterward he suspended the White House credentials of Jim Acosta of CNN, a very rare step. While Republicans' disarray didn't stop them from gaining two Senate seats, Democrats showed focus and flipped 28 in the House. Voters offered a portrait of a nation at odds with itself, while also electing the first Muslim and Native American women to Congress, among a series of historical firsts. Here's what the blue wave looked like, and why it was impressive. Many important races are still undecided. _____ • Gun culture in Italy.  The most powerful figure in Italy's populist government, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, above, has promoted himself as a law-and-order tough guy, cracking down on immigration, declaring a war on drugs and creating a sense of public safety emergency. And he's trying to import American-style gun culture. While campaigning earlier this year, Mr. Salvini pledged to cooperate with a group advocating looser gun laws, and in September they notched a victory when the government made it possible to own more guns, including the semiautomatic AR-15. Italy's gun lobby doesn't have the clout the N.R.A. wields in the U.S., but it is growing. _____ • A Russian theater director goes on trial.  Kirill Serebrennikov, above, renowned across Europe and beyond, is charged in a financial fraud case that is seen by Russia's intelligentsia as a test of artistic freedom under President Vladimir Putin. He and three co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to conspiring to embezzle more than $2 million in government funds in a Kremlin-sponsored art project. They face up to 10 years in prison. Mr. Serebrennikov's productions at the Gogol Center, a small Moscow theater, challenged Russia's conservative culture and often featured thinly veiled criticism of Mr. Putin. The artistic community fears that Mr. Putin, having tamed the country's oligarchs and news media, may now be determined to bring the arts to heel. _____ • More concerns over Boeing instruments. Aircraft problems may have played a role in the fatal crash of a brand-new Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesia last week, investigators said. An Indonesian official suggested that inaccurate readings could have prompted the Lion Air plane to enter a sudden, automatic descent. That added a new element to what investigators have been scrutinizing, including faulty airspeed indicators and possibly flawed maintenance. Boeing has issued a worldwide bulletin on how to respond to errant data to all operators of the plane, one of the most popular in commercial aviation. The developments suggested that multiple factors may have combined to cause the crash, which killed all 189 people aboard.

""It'll be up in lights on Broadway: Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World!"" an adventurer exclaims in the 1933 film ""King Kong."" Eighty-five years later, a $35 million musical version with the big ape officially opens in New York tonight. Before the movie was released, the excitement was palpable, even if newspapers didn't exactly know what would be happening. ""The film will show prehistoric monsters fighting one another and making weird sounds,"" The Times wrote in 1933. It was easy to see why the movie would be popular. The stop-motion special effects were groundbreaking, although film scholars saw thinly veiled racist overtones. Nevertheless, the Times reviewer was enthralled: ""Imagine a 50-foot beast with a girl in one paw climbing up the outside of the Empire State Building."" The movie, starring Fay Wray as the beauty who charms the beast, was among the first to be shown at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, shortly after the 6,200-seat theater was converted to show films. A box office hit, the movie was rereleased periodically and has featured in numerous remakes. In the original, Kong was an 18-inch puppet. In the new Broadway production, the ape is 20 feet tall and weighs 2,000 pounds. Not bad for the Eighth Wonder of the World.

News,2018-11-08,Obamacare didn’t just give more people health insurance. It also caused more people to vote.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/upshot/medicaid-expansion-voting-increase.html,804," Obamacare didn't just give more people health insurance. It also caused more people to vote. That's the conclusion of a new body of evidence that strongly suggests that giving people coverage through expansions of the Medicaid program increases their likelihood of participating in the next election. Medicaid expansions seem to raise both voter registration and voter participation, at least temporarily.   On Tuesday, voters in three states approved measures to further expand Medicaid. The election of Democratic governors in three more could also prompt new expansions. Researchers who worked on three recent studies of the effects say it's likely that those expansions will have a similar effect on voting in the next election cycle. ""We can confidently say: When you expand Medicaid eligibility, participation goes up,"" said Jake Haselswerdt, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Missouri, who wrote one of the papers. It's not clear exactly why getting Medicaid makes people more likely to vote, but there are a couple of theories. It could be that Medicaid, which has been shown to increase treatment for depression and improve financial stability, makes it easier for people to participate in the political process by giving them direct benefits. Over all, wealthier and healthier Americans tend to be more likely to vote than their poorer, sicker counterparts.  Perhaps enrollment in the program simply connected people with information about registration and voting, as it brought them into contact with government websites and case workers. Medicaid might also boost civic engagement by making people more grateful to the government and more interested in public policy. Earlier studies have shown that the creation of Social Security had a large effect on the civic participation of older Americans, and that the G.I. bill boosted participation from veterans who earned benefits under its program. ""These are programs that have a major effect on people's lives,"" said Andrea Campbell, a professor of political science at M.I.T., who wrote a book on the political legacy of Social Security. She suggested Medicaid could work similarly, by improving people's circumstances and making them more aware of the stakes of government action. A somewhat conflicting body of evidence has shown that enrollment in stigmatized programs, like cash welfare, actually depresses voting. Medicaid may be more like Social Security. Two of the recent studies looked at what happened during the big Medicaid expansions in 2014, which occurred as a result of the Affordable Care Act. A Supreme Court ruling made the expansion optional, and only about half of states expanded right away. One study, from the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, compared voting later that year between states that expanded and those that didn't. Another study, from the American Political Science Review, zoomed in more narrowly, looking just at similar counties on the borders between states that expanded and those that didn't. Both papers showed increases in voter registration and voting. In the neighboring-counties research, people in the expansion counties were more likely to register and to vote, by three to four percentage points. A third study, released as a working paper this week, looked at an earlier Medicaid expansion, when Oregon opened up its program to some childless adults in 2008. The state set up a lottery to determine who got coverage, which led to an important randomized experiment of how Medicaid coverage affects people's lives. Unlike the 2014 research, the Oregon study was able to track voting by individual, not just region. It found that the Medicaid expansion increased voter turnout by 7 percent among the newly covered group in Oregon.  Voting is private, so none of the research could say whether the new Medicaid voters supported Democrats or Republicans. Mr. Haselswerdt, who did the statewide study, said it might even be possible that some of the voting increase by Medicaid beneficiaries was matched by increased voting by expansion opposers.  But the people eligible for Medicaid expansion tend to be poor, single adults, a demographic more likely to be Democratic-leaning. And the Oregon study showed bigger voting effects in more heavily Democratic parts of the state.  Even though all the studies detected an effect of Medicaid on voting, none of them showed one that lasted. Political science research suggests that voting can be a habit-forming behavior, but that may not be the case for this particular group. In each study, the voting boost after expansion had faded by the next election. That means that the coming expansions may make an electoral difference only once. ""Medicaid coverage policy is still front and center in the political debate,"" said Katherine Baicker, a co-author on the Oregon work and the dean of the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago. ""Having this kind of information about how Medicaid coverage affects not only health and health care use and financial security, but also civic engagement, seems like a really important relationship to have a little more information about."""
News,2018-11-08,"Six weeks after settling a securities-fraud lawsuit with federal regulators, Tesla and Elon Musk have made good on one of the agreement’s key provisions — naming a new board chief to impose order on a company whose automaking has often been overshadowed by Mr. Musk’s behavior.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/business/tesla-new-chairwoman-elon-musk.html,1257," Six weeks after settling a securities-fraud lawsuit with federal regulators, Tesla and Elon Musk have made good on one of the agreement's key provisions — naming a new board chief to impose order on a company whose automaking has often been overshadowed by Mr. Musk's behavior. The company said a current director, Robyn Denholm, would become its chairwoman immediately. Mr. Musk stepped down as chairman last month but remains Tesla's chief executive. Ms. Denholm, 55, is the chief financial officer of Telstra, which dominates telecommunications in Australia. She is a longtime technology executive with experience in Silicon Valley, where Tesla is based, and once worked for Toyota in Australia. The move to replace Mr. Musk as chairman, announced late Wednesday night, was part of a settlement reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September to deal with the fallout from his assertion that he had secured funding for a private buyout of the company. That claim, in a Twitter post in August, quickly fell into doubt. (Mr. Musk later explained in a blog post that discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund led him to believe that it had both money and enthusiasm for such a deal.) Under the settlement, Tesla agreed to name a new leader for the board, splitting those responsibilities from Mr. Musk's post as chief executive, by next Tuesday. The company was also required to add two independent board members and to set up a permanent committee to monitor Mr. Musk's public declarations, including his Twitter posts. It has several weeks to complete that requirement. Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said the appointment of Ms. Denholm ""technically complies"" with the S.E.C. settlement, but he questioned how much Ms. Denholm would be able to push back against a forceful personality like Mr. Musk. ""If the goal is to provide adult supervision, it won't accomplish that,"" Mr. Gordon said. ""She's been on the board through all of the shenanigans. She never resigned in protest. She is a Musk supporter. If it doesn't work out, she will be the one who leaves. It won't be Musk who leaves."" Mr. Musk has galvanized investors and the public imagination with his sleek electric cars and his big dreams for space travel and other ambitions. But his public declarations increasingly unnerved Tesla shareholders and the directors who represent them. Production problems only added to those concerns. Tesla reported a substantial profit in the third quarter, powered by a significant jump in production and sales of its Model 3 sedan. The earnings beat the expectations of many analysts and eased worries about its finances, for now. In the first half of 2018, the company reported losses and used up more than $1 billion in cash. ""They are doing much better than we thought they would a quarter ago,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. ""You have to give them credit for that."" Yet Tesla still faces challenges. It must prove it can sustain profits in the fourth quarter and beyond, pay out more than $1 billion to bondholders over the next few months, address quality issues and fix a chaotic delivery system. Tesla has also had an exodus of senior executives. It has had three chief accounting officers this year. And while the fraud suit with the S.E.C. has been settled, Tesla's past production forecasts for the Model 3 are still being examined by the agency. ""In just about every area, they've had extraordinary volatility,"" Mr. Sonnenfeld said. David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar who follows Tesla, said the appointment of Ms. Denholm was ""a good balance"" and was probably best for Tesla's stock price. Bringing in a hard-nosed outsider ""who wouldn't put up with Elon's Twitter nonsense,"" he added, ""would clash with Elon and it wouldn't work at all."" Tesla shares rose almost 1 percent on Thursday. Still, Mr. Whiston also expressed doubts about how much Ms. Denholm will be able to constrain Mr. Musk. In the last few weeks, the chief executive referred to the S.E.C. on Twitter as the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission,"" and then announced that he no longer had a title at Tesla, raising questions about whether he would continue to have the final word, even with a new leader of the board. ""It's troubling to me that since the settlement Elon has already made a mockery of the S.E.C. twice,"" Mr. Whiston said. He said Mr. Musk should ""stop playing games and just make the darn cars."" Ms. Denholm, a Tesla director since 2014, is one of nine members of a board whose independence has been an issue. In June, shareholders put forward proposals to split the jobs of chief executive and chairman and to deny re-election to some incumbent directors — including Mr. Musk's brother, Kimbal. Tesla said the measures were overwhelmingly rejected. Mr. Musk himself holds about one-fifth of the company's shares. Mr. Sonnenfeld said he would have preferred to see Tesla name a chairman with deep automotive experience, like Alan Mulally or Mark Fields, both former Ford Motor chief executives. ""It would do them good to get somebody who knows how to run the production process without sleeping on the factory floor,"" he said. Ms. Denholm's exposure to the auto industry came in her seven years at Toyota Motor Corporation Australia, where she was national manager for finance, before leaving in 1996 for Sun Microsystems, a onetime Silicon Valley powerhouse later acquired by Oracle. Before her current position at Telstra, Ms. Denholm was an executive at Juniper Networks, which makes computer networking equipment, for about a decade. She has both Australian and American citizenship. Tesla said Ms. Denholm would step down from her role at Telstra once her six-month notice period is complete. Mr. Whiston said Ms. Denholm's plan to leave Telstra ""shows commitment to Tesla to make sure this oversight is done properly."" But Professor Gordon cautioned that once she left her Telstra position, being chairwoman of Tesla ""will be her full-time gig,"" making her less likely to confront Mr. Musk. ""It will be a job she doesn't want to lose,"" he said. Mr. Musk heralded the change in typical fashion — on Twitter. In the Tesla announcement, Mr. Musk cited Ms. Denholm's experience and years with his company. ""Robyn has extensive experience in both the tech and auto industries, and she has made significant contributions as a Tesla board member over the past four years in helping us become a profitable company,"" he said. ""I look forward to working even more closely with Robyn as we continue accelerating the advent of sustainable energy."" In August, Mr. Musk told The New York Times that this year ""has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,"" in part because of the pressure of running Tesla, and that he sometimes took the insomnia drug Ambien to sleep. Some board members worried the drug was contributing to his late-night Twitter sessions. In addition to his troublesome tweet about a buyout, Mr. Musk had a nasty social media battle with a British diver involved in the daring rescue of 12 boys in a flooded cave in Thailand over the summer — a spat he had to quickly walk back. In September, he appeared to briefly smoke marijuana during an interview with Joe Rogan, a comedian. The interview took place in California, where recreational marijuana use is legal. Now the question is whether Mr. Musk can conform to the more conventional corporate culture that Ms. Denholm is meant to represent."
News,2018-11-08,"JB Reefer was always on the lookout for a place to buy, even before he met Erica Romero, who would become Erica Reefer, three years ago.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/realestate/the-beauty-of-a-no-nothing-walk-up.html,985," JB Reefer was always on the lookout for a place to buy, even before he met Erica Romero, who would become Erica Reefer, three years ago. ""I've lived in a shocking number of apartments, and a lot of things that are bad about New York go away when you own your place,"" he said, noting that rising rents constitute ""a core human misery in New York."" The couple, who were engaged a year after they met, later shared a two-bedroom rental for $2,500 a month on the ground floor of a house in Astoria, Queens. ""JB loves real estate,"" Mrs. Reefer said. ""He is always scoping it out and seeing what is on the market. I am along for the ride. We wanted to start putting our money toward our future."" In Astoria, the couple, both 29, found few appealing options. So they turned their attention to Manhattan, as Mr. Reefer also wanted to improve his commute to the Financial District, where he works as a software engineer. Mrs. Reefer works in Times Square, in human resources. For up to $800,000, they sought a two-bedroom — or at least something with space enough to create a second bedroom — in a co-op building. ""I am pro co-op because I want to live in a nice place with neighbors who also want a nice place,"" Mrs. Reefer said. ""It is such a big deal to be buying an apartment that I want to be surrounded by people who also care about where they live."" One priority was a dishwasher. Mr. Reefer does all the cooking and Mrs. Reefer much of the cleaning up. In Astoria, they got by with a countertop dishwasher that attached to the kitchen sink. They also wanted to avoid full-service buildings. Mr. Reefer's two dads live in a Yorkville co-op, ""with porters, doormen, gardeners and paint guys, and there is so much tipping and all those rules,"" he said. ""I am in my 20s. I can carry things upstairs. I wanted an old-school, tenement-style, no-elevator, no-nothing walk-up.""  They emailed about a listing in a beautiful Gramercy Park building, circa 1928, that they found on StreetEasy, and heard from Karen Kostiw, a licensed saleswoman at Warburg Realty. The price was $795,000 when they saw it, having dropped from $975,000. Maintenance was around $1,250 a month. The master bedroom was less than 100 square feet, and the Pullman kitchen was advertised as ""smart, sleek and the perfect size for the city dweller."" That meant a dorm-size refrigerator and minimal counter space. ""It was less of a kitchen than in most hotels I've stayed in,"" Mr. Reefer said. ""I think that apartment is for a pied-à-terre or for the kind of person, like my friends, who don't cook but just order out."" The apartment later sold for $750,000. In Greenwich Village, a two-bedroom in a charming walk-up was going for around $700,000, with maintenance of $1,000. It seemed ""incredible for the price, and there was probably a reason for that,"" Mrs. Reefer said. ""We were blinded by the address and the cool neighborhood."" As it turned out, a single investor owned most of the co-op shares in the building and was renting many of the units, making a mortgage difficult to obtain. ""The fantasy was we would find something really cheap by being smarter than everybody else, but it was never that realistic,"" Mr. Reefer said. Still, they had fun frequenting open houses, lining up an itinerary for the day and stopping for brunch. ""A two-bedroom the size they were looking for at that price point is not an easy find,"" Ms. Kostiw said. She suggested their luck would improve on the Upper East Side. It did. One option was on a ground floor in Yorkville, listed at $765,000, with maintenance of around $1,150. It had a second bathroom, but was in rough shape. ""You would need to be somebody like my little brother, who works in construction, to buy that place,"" Mr. Reefer said. The couple also wasn't keen on the street-level location, having spent months smelling the smoke and listening to the conversations of people walking past their Astoria rental. And they were indifferent to the shared garden. The apartment remains on the market for $729,000. ""We were a little obsessive at this point,"" Mrs. Reefer said. ""We knew every apartment under $800,000 in Manhattan. We were either not interested, or we saw it in person."" Then, one chilly day, a new Yorkville listing appeared on a high floor in just the kind of building they liked. In a downpour, they took a cab from Astoria and arrived to find an empty open house. By the end of it, they were still the only ones on the sign-in sheet. They loved the long, narrow layout, which meant fresh air and a cross-breeze, as well as the modern kitchen, with a dishwasher and the bonus of a combination washer-dryer. Stepping inside ""was like when I met Erica,"" Mr. Reefer said. ""It was a completely different thing."" They offered $650,000 on an asking price of $725,000, settling at $690,000. Maintenance is just under $1,500.  After they moved in last winter with their two cats, the couple, who were married last summer, made some minor repairs: adding window screens, changing light fixtures and removing old wires that prevented a door and a window from closing. They jettisoned much of their old furniture and gave the countertop dishwasher to their old upstairs neighbors. ""All the stuff we had that looked O.K. in a shabby apartment in Astoria looks terrible in here,"" Mr. Reefer said.  He carries things upstairs; she puts them away. Most of all, they are pleased to be homeowners. ""If somebody tracks garbage in the hallway, I will pick it up because I own the place,"" Mr. Reefer said. ""It's my first homeownership experience, and it's very different from renting,"" he said. ""Kind of like how being married is different from dating.""

News,2018-11-08,Good Thursday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/business/dealbook/corporate-america-midterms.html,1743," Good Thursday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.) The Dow Jones industrial average climbed almost 550 points yesterday. The S&P 500 enjoyed its biggest postelection rally in 30 years. Why? Per Barron's: ""It's finally over."" Corporate leaders still have much to fear, including President Trump's trade fight with China. But they view Washington gridlock as largely positive, as it will ward off sweeping policy changes that could upset the strong environment for business. (These are the economic indicators that will show if that theory holds.) Here are some other key corporate takeaways from the midterms: • Energy: Renewables companies benefited from Democratic victories on the state level, where a lot of energy policy is set. Oil producers suffered setbacks in some states, but blocked a carbon tax initiative in Washington State. • Tech: Both parties are expected to come together on potential new privacy regulations, but they are likely to clash on net neutrality rules. • Health care: Insurance providers are happy that no repeal of the Affordable Care Act is on the table. Both Democrats and Mr. Trump want to lower drug prices, but it's unclear what they can accomplish. • Finance: Representative Maxine Waters of California, a skeptic of the industry, is likely to take over the House Financial Services Committee. Among her expected targets is Deutsche Bank, which she wants to scrutinize over its ties to Mr. Trump. • Taxes: Mr. Trump said yesterday that he's open to a rise in corporate taxes — which he cut last year to 21 percent from 35 percent — to pay for a middle-class tax cut. One big boon for business: Continued Republican control of the Senate, which will help Mr. Trump to keep adding judges that are seen as favorable to corporate interests. ____________________________ Today's DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London. ____________________________ The automaker chose Robyn Denholm, the C.F.O. of the Australian telecommunications company Telstra, to replace Elon Musk as chair of the company's board. Ms. Denholm has been an independent director at Tesla since 2014, and will step down from her role at Telstra. The move is the result of a settlement between Tesla and the S.E.C. over Mr. Musk's tweets about plans to take the company private. To end a lawsuit over the posts, the S.E.C. demanded that the automaker separate the roles of chairman and C.E.O., and Mr. Musk is now unable to serve as chairman for three years. Tim Higgins of the WSJ considers Ms. Denholm's appointment: The decision thrusts into one of the brightest spotlights in American business a woman who is little known in the U.S. but has extensive experience as a finance executive in Silicon Valley and her native Australia. As a Tesla board member, Ms. Denholm has provided some rare automotive experience to a company that prides itself on being an industry outsider. She spent seven years at Toyota Motor Corp. in Australia, where she was a senior financial manager. More Tesla news: The venture capitalist Tim Draper says that Elon Musk should have tried to take the company private sooner. It isn't just Amazon that's reportedly planning to open huge new offices there. The NYT reports that Google is in discussions to move into a planned 1.3 million-square-foot office complex at the St. John's Terminal building on the West Side of Manhattan. Google currently employs around 7,000 people in New York. The new space could house up to 8,500 people, according to the WSJ. As it expands throughout the city, the company could eventually have space for as many as 20,000 staff members. With Amazon also reportedly planning to locate half of its proposed HQ2 (and about 25,000 jobs) in Long Island City, Queens, New York could become a tech hub. Not everyone will be pleased about that: Daisuke Wakabayashi of the NYT notes that ""as tech companies expand in New York, they are likely to compete with Wall Street for engineering talent."" Amazon HQ2 news: What we don't know about its plan to split the new office in two. What it could mean for Long Island City's infrastructure. And how the decision could leave the rest of the country behind. The Fed announces its latest policies. The central bank isn't expected to raise rates today. Some economists believe it could point to softening business investment and housing markets as signs of slowing growth. President Trump has long been expected to replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Yesterday, he did. But the new acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, has been publicly skeptical of the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Though Mr. Trump has said that he won't fire Mr. Mueller, Mr. Whitaker could make the special counsel's job much harder. He could slash Mr. Mueller's budget — an idea he floated last year — or block off lines of inquiry, like Mr. Trump's finances. Democrats have called on Mr. Whitaker to recuse himself, given his previous public comments. Expect the political battling to drag on. More on Mr. Sessions: Cannabis stocks jumped yesterday on the news of his ouster because of his opposition to legalizing marijuana. Hedge funds suffered their worst October in seven years, according to Hedge Fund Research. Energy and tech stocks are to blame for their poor performance, according to Lindsay Fortado of the FT: H.F.R.'s equity hedge fund index fell 4.25 percent in October — its worst performance in nearly three years — while the index that tracks funds that invest in technology stocks fared the worst, with a decline of 4.7 percent. Those strategies weren't even the worst performers for the month. That title went to H.F.R.'s index that tracked funds that invest in energy stocks, which was down just over 8 percent for October. Among the losers: Dan Loeb's Third Point, which lost 6.7 percent, and Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, which was down 8.4 percent. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital Management, which has struggled so far in 2018, was among the few funds that showed a gain. The renminbi has slid in value for months, but the country has been working hard to keep it from plummeting. The FT reports that China spent roughly $32 billion in foreign exchange reserves to strengthen the currency last month, the heaviest monthly investment into propping up the renminbi in almost two years. Analysts broadly think that China sees a renminbi exchange rate of 7 to the dollar as a big psychological barrier (the currency is currently just below that level). The big spending suggests that is the case, but the FT also notes that the Chinese central bank is treading a careful line to avoid eroding its foreign exchange reserves below $3 trillion. The news may assuage some concerns about whether China is unfairly manipulating its currency. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned China not to reduce the renminbi's value as a weapon in its trade war with the U.S. Goldman Sachs named 69 new partners, its smallest class in three decades, but also its most diverse to date. CDK, a maker of software for car dealerships, hired Brian Krzanich, the former Intel C.E.O., as its new chief executive. Tom Barrack ousted Richard Saltzman as C.E.O. of Colony Capital and took the role for himself. Vice Media will shrink its staff by up to 15 percent through a hiring freeze and close at least half of its websites. Toshiba plans to cut 7,000 jobs over the next five years.

briefing,2018-11-08, (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/briefing/thousand-oaks-jeff-sessions-tesla.html,1405,"  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: At least 12 people, including a sheriff's deputy, were killed late Wednesday in a shooting at a country and western dance hall in Thousand Oaks, Calif., officials said. The gunman is also dead, officials said, adding that there was no longer a threat to the public after the shooting at the dance hall, the Borderline Bar and Grill, which was holding an event for college students. • The location: Thousand Oaks, a relatively affluent city in Ventura County, is about 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. President Trump replaced Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday with Matthew Whitaker, who has questioned the scope of the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Sessions, who resigned at the president's request, recused himself in March 2017 from overseeing the investigation, citing his role in Mr. Trump's campaign. Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, has been overseeing the inquiry. As acting attorney general, Mr. Whitaker now has that responsibility. He has said that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, would be going too far if he examined the Trump family finances. • Profile: Mr. Whitaker, Mr. Sessions's chief of staff and a former U.S. attorney, has been forging ties to the White House, where he is seen as a reliable ally. • Looking back: Mr. Sessions helped promote Mr. Trump's agenda, particularly on immigration and in addressing violent crime and opioids, but his recusal from the Russia investigation cost him the president's support. • What's next: One of our Washington correspondents answered questions about the implications of Mr. Sessions's firing. A day after his party lost control of the House, President Trump threatened to adopt a ""warlike posture"" if Democrats used their new power to investigate his financial and political dealings. He made his remarks at a news conference that started with an offer to work across party lines. He went on to scold reporters whose questions or behavior he didn't like, including Jim Acosta of CNN, whose White House credentials were suspended by the end of the day. • The House: Democrats made gains by focusing on health care, while Republicans lost their grip on unity and messaging, our correspondents write. • The Senate: Republican wins have strengthened the influence of social conservatives, who are seeking to push harder to the right on issues including abortion. • Election firsts: There will be at least 100 women in the House next year. Here are some others who made history on Tuesday. • Too close to call: Several races, including the one for Georgia governor, have yet to be decided. • Partisan picks: Writers from across the political spectrum discuss the midterm elections. The goal of talks scheduled for today had been to plan a second summit meeting between President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. But the State Department announced on Wednesday that the meeting between Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and a top North Korean official had been canceled. • Mixed messages: Mr. Trump later said that the meeting would be rescheduled and that ""we're very happy with how it's going with North Korea."" • What might Democratic control of the House mean for your wallet? Tax-overhaul initiatives could be blocked, but there may be room for agreement on other measures. Here's a breakdown. • Tesla named Robyn Denholm, an Australian telecommunications executive, as its new chairwoman, as it tries to move beyond regulatory problems and concerns about Elon Musk's leadership. Mr. Musk will remain chief executive. • Google is in discussions to move into an office complex on Manhattan's West Side that could allow it to more than double its local work force of 7,000. • Canada is running low on legal marijuana three weeks after recreational use of the drug became legal. The shortage is sending some frustrated consumers back to the black market. • AbeBooks, a secondhand bookselling network owned by Amazon, bowed to a worldwide strike of antiquarian booksellers, appearing to reverse its largely unexplained decision to cut off stores in five countries. • U.S. stocks were up on Wednesday.

""It'll be up in lights on Broadway: Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World!"" an adventurer exclaims in the 1933 film ""King Kong."" Eighty-five years later, a $35 million musical version with the big ape officially opens in New York tonight. Before the movie was released, the excitement was palpable, even if newspapers didn't exactly know what would be happening. ""The film will show prehistoric monsters fighting one another and making weird sounds,"" The Times wrote in 1933. It was easy to see why the movie would be popular. The stop-motion special effects were groundbreaking, although film scholars saw thinly veiled racist overtones. Nevertheless, the Times reviewer was enthralled: ""Imagine a 50-foot beast with a girl in one paw climbing up the outside of the Empire State Building."" The movie, starring Fay Wray as the beauty who charms the beast, was among the first to be shown at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, shortly after the 6,200-seat theater was converted to show films. A box office hit, the movie was rereleased periodically and has featured in numerous remakes. In the original, Kong was an 18-inch puppet. In the new Broadway production, the ape is 20 feet tall and weighs 2,000 pounds. Not bad for the Eighth Wonder of the World.

News,2018-11-08,Update: The Tai Kwun Center for Heritage and Arts said on Friday that it would host the Ma Jian events as scheduled.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/world/asia/hong-kong-ma-jian.html,973," Update: The Tai Kwun Center for Heritage and Arts said on Friday that it would host the Ma Jian events as scheduled. HONG KONG — A cultural venue run by a nonprofit organization with close ties to the Hong Kong government has abruptly canceled plans to host two events featuring an exiled Chinese writer, in what some saw as the latest sign of eroding freedoms in the city.  The cancellation came just days before the writer, Ma Jian, was scheduled to speak at the Tai Kwun Center for Heritage and Arts as part of the annual Hong Kong International Literary Festival. It left festival organizers scrambling to find a new venue for the Saturday events. ""We do not want Tai Kwun to become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual,"" Timothy Calnin, director of Tai Kwun, said in a statement sent to reporters on Thursday. ""We have therefore worked closely with the Hong Kong International Literary Festival to find a more suitable alternative venue."" Mr. Ma, 65, who is currently based in London, was scheduled to speak at a panel discussion on Hong Kong literature as well as give a talk about his new novel, ""China Dream."" Published in Britain last week, the book, whose title refers to the signature propaganda catchphrase of Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, was described by the publisher as a ""biting satire of totalitarianism that reveals what happens to a nation when it is blinded by materialism and governed by violence and lies."" While Tai Kwun, which is financed and operated by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, did not make specific reference to Mr. Ma in its statement, the venue's decision to pull out of the events came after the author wrote in a Twitter post last week that publishers in Hong Kong had declined to publish ""China Dream"" — ""the first time that's happened to one of my books."" Speaking by telephone from London, several hours before his flight to Hong Kong, the writer accused Mr. Calnin of ""turning a literary festival into a political matter."" ""He hasn't even read the book yet and he has already passed a political judgment,"" said Mr. Ma. Mr. Ma's books have been banned in mainland China ever since his first novella, ""Stick Out Your Tongue,"" a collection of short stories about the Han Chinese occupation of Tibet, was published in 1987. Mr. Ma, an outspoken critic of the Communist government whose other novels include ""Red Dust"" and ""Beijing Coma,"" lived in Hong Kong for a decade as a dissident before moving to Germany and then London. Though he has been barred from entering mainland China since 2011, Mr. Ma, a British citizen, said he has permanent resident status in Hong Kong, and he spoke at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival as recently as 2013. Tai Kwun's last-minute decision to withdraw from the events comes amid growing concerns about the future of the semiautonomous Chinese city as a haven for rule of law and civil rights in Asia. Last week, the political cartoonist Badiucao, whose works satirize leaders of mainland China and Hong Kong, called off a solo exhibition in Hong Kong one day before its opening after receiving threats from the Chinese authorities. Last month, the Hong Kong authorities expelled Victor Mallet, an editor at The Financial Times, a decision that was widely seen as retaliation for Mr. Mallet's role in hosting a talk with a local independence advocate at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong in August. And on Thursday night, Mr. Mallet was denied entry into Hong Kong as a visitor, The Financial Times said. And in recent years, Hong Kong-based publishers have come under increasing pressure, particularly following the disappearance in 2016 of several booksellers who sold gossipy titles on China's political elite. ""Before, Hong Kong was a haven for arts and literature — a place where we felt like we could hide from China and find true freedom of thought,"" said Mr. Ma. ""But now that era is slowly disappearing."" The Tai Kwun Center for Heritage and Arts opened in May after an eight-year, $484 million restoration of the 19th-century central police station compound undertaken by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the city's sole legal betting operator and largest charitable organization, in close cooperation with the city government. In 2016, the Jockey Club drew criticism when it announced a donation of $451 million to open a local branch of Beijing's Palace Museum, fueling concerns about the mainland government's growing efforts to assert its influence in Hong Kong. The museum is expected to be completed by mid-2022. Tai Kwun is the primary venue for this year's Hong Kong International Literary Festival, which runs through Sunday. Many criticized its decision to pull out of Mr. Ma's events. ""The cancellation appears to be at the very least an act of self-censorship, which would add to a growing list of incidents of suppression of free expression in Hong Kong,"" Jason Y. Ng, president of PEN Hong Kong, said in a statement. ""It is all the more jarring that the decision was made by a publicly funded venue that claims to celebrate and support the arts and creativity."" It was not the first time a cultural institution in Hong Kong had altered its program because of concerns about politicization. In 2015, the title of an exhibition of contemporary Chinese art at M+, Hong Kong's publicly financed, long-planned ""museum of visual culture,"" was changed from the more challenging ""Right Is Wrong"" to the straightforward ""M+ Sigg Collection: Four Decades of Chinese Contemporary Art"" after museum committee members raised concerns. ""The problem in Hong Kong is not censorship,"" Pi Li, the Sigg senior curator at M+, said at the time. ""The problem in Hong Kong is self-censorship. It's self-censorship hidden in the procedures, so it's difficult to distinguish."""
News,2018-11-08,Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/business/dealbook/europe-bank-cop.html,411," Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Lenders shouldn't expect much help with their bad debts from Europe's new senior financial watchdog. The European Central Bank on Wednesday nominated Andrea Enria as chair of its supervisory board, which oversees the continent's 118 biggest lenders. Mr. Enria, from Italy, is currently the respected head of the European Banking Authority, and is unlikely to take a softer line on tackling lenders' bad debts. The industry's chronic low profitability and poor money-laundering controls present bigger challenges. Some might hope that his promotion would lead to softer treatment of Italian lenders, many of which are still grappling with bad debts. They are likely to be disappointed. Colleagues joke that Mr. Enria, a former Bank of Italy economist, is sufficiently northern that he may as well be Austrian. His orthodox credentials, and his experience of dealing with large, international financial institutions as chair of the European Banking Authority since 2011, helped him secure the nomination over Sharon Donnery, the deputy governor of Ireland's central bank. It's true that Mr. Enria has shown dovish impulses. In 2017 he called for the creation of a regional ""bad bank"" to help clean up dud loans. That would have implied a degree of risk sharing by European governments — anathema to Germany — and his plea fell on deaf ears. Since then, the E.C.B. has pushed banks to tackle their own problems. If confirmed, Mr. Enria will have bigger issues to tackle. First up are the European Union's lax money-laundering controls, which have led to the sudden closure of banks in Malta and Latvia this year. The scandal in which up to 200 billion euros of potentially suspicious funds flowed through Danske Bank's Estonian unit has cast a cloud over the Danish lender, and could yet infect others. But the E.C.B. has no formal anti-money laundering powers, instead relying on national authorities — or U.S. authorities — to take action. Then there is the thorny issue of low profitability. Inside the E.C.B., there is widespread dismay that, despite a benign economy and record-low bad debt charges, banks still can't make good profits. The European banking industry's average return on equity is 7.2 percent, according to European Banking Authority figures, well below a probable 10 percent cost of capital. Tackling these issues, rather than doing favors for banks in his home country, will be Mr. Enria's top priorities."
News,2018-11-09,"LOGAN, W.Va. — Richard Ojeda presented himself as a new face of the Democratic Party: a tough guy in combat boots whose economic populism was the key to flipping coal country and maybe — just maybe — a model for winning in rural America in the age of Donald J. Trump.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/west-virginia-midterm-election-richard-ojeda.html,1174," LOGAN, W.Va. — Richard Ojeda presented himself as a new face of the Democratic Party: a tough guy in combat boots whose economic populism was the key to flipping coal country and maybe — just maybe — a model for winning in rural America in the age of Donald J. Trump. For a moment, Mr. Ojeda seemed poised to pull it off. He channeled West Virginia's union roots when he championed a statewide teachers' strike earlier this year. He had a plain-speaking, almost Trump-like style that attracted attention and money, drawing more than $2 million in donations from around the country. But on Tuesday he lost badly, taking just two out of the 18 counties that make up the Third Congressional District, a swath in the southern coal fields that is home to Mr. Ojeda and many of the teachers he supported. He even lost his home county, Logan, by 24 points. ""I was absolutely slapped in the face when I saw the totals,"" said Heather Ritter, a school librarian and supporter of Mr. Ojeda, the day after the election. She added, ""I don't think people understand what's just happened and the gravity of this."" While the Democrats succeeded in winning back the House — and Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia managed to hang onto his seat — the magnitude of Mr. Ojeda's loss served as a stinging reminder to Democrats of the enduring power of Mr. Trump in rural parts of the country, particularly in Appalachia. Mr. Ojeda's supporters expected him to become a major force on the national stage, an important corrective to past mistakes when Democrats did not listen to working-class voters. Instead, he was dragged down by the undertow of nationalized politics — with Mr. Trump making many visits to West Virginia and supporting Mr. Ojeda's opponent, Carol Miller, whose main appeal to voters appeared to be her connection to the president. Antipathy toward Mr. Trump helped drive record turnout in some parts of the country, but many voters also came out to support the president. This was especially true in West Virginia, where more than 47 percent of the state's registered voters turned out on Tuesday — significantly more than in recent midterm years, according to the West Virginia secretary of state. In 51 interviews in five different towns in the district where Mr. Ojeda ran, a majority of voters said they turned out to defend the president. Dennis McCloud, a retired coal miner in the tiny town of Dingess, said he was voting for the first time in a midterm election. He said he had come to show support for Mr. Trump, who he said had been besieged by the news media and Democrats. ""If he says this cone is red, they'll say it's blue,"" said Mr. McCloud, 65, pointing to a traffic cone on the sidewalk as he stood outside an elementary school in Dingess, where he had just voted for Ms. Miller, a candidate he said he hadn't heard much about. ""I never felt this strongly about a president before,"" said Mr. McCloud, who was about to go celebrate his birthday — and his vote — with a steak. Social media also seems to have played a role in Mr. Ojeda's loss. Supporters point to a flurry of activity on Facebook with doctored photographs aimed at discrediting him. In one, Mr. Ojeda is sitting in a chair in front of his campaign sign smiling and holding cash like a fan. In another, a Facebook page called Veterans Against Richard Ojeda featured a picture of him altered to look like he was in makeup, pink fatigues and a pink beret. Matt Stanley, a school administrator who was staring in disbelief at the election results at Mr. Ojeda's election night party, said he saw them as a grim sign for the American political system. ""It's just disgusting that social media rules,"" he said. ""What he says they don't believe, but what they see on the computer, they do believe. Explain that to me. I can't wrap my head around it."" Of Ms. Miller, he said: ""She didn't show up to anything. She didn't have to."" Ms. Miller, a state delegate, was relatively unknown among voters and mostly avoided interviews and open public appearances during the campaign. Even the men sitting in lawn chairs behind a large sign that urged voters in Dingess to choose Ms. Miller were thin on details about their candidate. ""Don't know that much about her to be honest with you,"" said Hayden Hannah, 70, a retired timber worker, ""but she stands for Trump and that's enough for me."" One of Ms. Miller's campaign ads says she's a bison farmer who has supported legislation to make the Bible the official book of West Virginia. Her financial disclosure forms show her household controls a businesses that include real estate, car dealerships, and other investment assets worth $11 million. Ms. Miller did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Some voters said Mr. Ojeda had himself to blame for the poor showing. Carl Blevins, a retired coal miner in Chapmanville who said he did not like Mr. Trump and his style, said he also did not support Mr. Ojeda for some of the same reasons. ""He was his own worst enemy,"" Mr. Blevins said, sitting with a group of friends on Wednesday at Tudor's Biscuit World. ""There's an arrogance, like he knows more than the rest of us."" Mr. Trump made a number of trips to West Virginia to stump for Republicans, most recently last Friday. He has singled out Mr. Ojeda personally, calling him ""stone-cold crazy"" and ""a total wacko."" Mary Frances, a 78-year-old from Dingess, said she had come to vote for the sole purpose of supporting the president. She said she supported Ms. Miller, even though she did not know much about her. ""There are too many crooked politicians — one is about as good as the next one,"" she said. But Mr. Trump was different, she said, and he was protecting the country, including from the caravan of migrants, a large traveling group that moved from Central America into Mexico last month. ""If all those people come in here it will decimate this country,"" Ms. Frances said. On Tuesday night, Mr. Ojeda pledged to keep fighting, but also pondered whether it was even possible for a Democrat to win in West Virginia's Third Congressional District, which Mr. Trump won by nearly 50 points in 2016. ""Look, I really don't know what to say,"" he said. ""I'm not happy with the outcome, but I'm telling you right now, any place else in the United States of America we would have won. Anyplace else. We just happened to run in the reddest — and I hate to say this — an area where people just completely will fall for what we just had."" He added: ""We had a president who came down here and said 'Hey, I want you all to vote for her.' They didn't look and say, 'Why should we vote for her?'"""
News,2018-11-09,"LOS ANGELES — Disney returned to annual profit growth on Thursday after a difficult 2017, the result of blockbuster movies, rising theme park attendance and a stabilizing ESPN.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/business/media/disney-earnings-streaming-service.html,740," LOS ANGELES — Disney returned to annual profit growth on Thursday after a difficult 2017, the result of blockbuster movies, rising theme park attendance and a stabilizing ESPN. Despite reporting a record profit of $12.6 billion for its fiscal year, the Walt Disney Company spent most of a call with analysts discussing its high-risk plan to introduce a Netflix-style subscription streaming service late next year, which will carry enormous content, technology and marketing expenses. Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, unveiled the name of the streaming service on Thursday, telling analysts on a conference call that it would be called Disney Plus, styled by the company as Disney+. The name parallels the one for Disney's fledgling sports streaming service, ESPN Plus. In addition to the original shows and films already announced, Disney Plus will include a live-action ""Star Wars"" series based on the rebel spy Cassian Andor, a character from the 2016 film ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story."" Diego Luna will reprise the role, Mr. Iger said. Disney Plus will also feature a live-action Marvel series about Loki, the god of mischief from the ""Thor"" movies. Tom Hiddleston will reprise that role. Mr. Iger also gave an update on Disney's $71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox. European regulators approved the deal on Tuesday, which Mr. Iger called a ""major milestone."" Disney is still waiting for approval from a handful of countries, but Mr. Iger said he expected the deal to close ""meaningfully earlier"" than June, Disney's initial time frame. As for Sky, the British pay-television company that Disney lost to Comcast in a September bidding war, Mr. Iger said, ""You can't cry over spilled milk — nothing you can do about it."" He conceded that it would take Disney ""a little bit longer"" to roll out Disney Plus in Europe as a result. For the most recent quarter, the fourth in Disney's fiscal year, net income totaled $2.3 billion, a 33 percent increase from a year earlier. Profit for the year rose 40 percent. Analysts had expected far less growth for both the quarter and year. Although Disney ended its fiscal year on a high note, the coming quarter may be rough. Christine M. McCarthy, Disney's chief financial officer, cautioned that movie operating income could fall by as much as $600 million — or roughly 70 percent — because of comparisons to ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" in 2017. The lack of a ""Star Wars"" movie over the holidays will also hurt Disney's consumer products business. And programming costs at ESPN will climb because of the timing of sporting events. There were also areas of weakness in the quarter that just ended. Disney Consumer Products reported another drop in operating income — its fifth quarterly decline in a row — because of write-downs related to the Disney Store chain and worsening licensing results for the ""Cars"" franchise. Disney also disclosed that it had written off about 40 percent of its investment in the moribund Vice Media, or $157 million. And Disney turned to discounting to prop up attendance at Shanghai Disney Resort. ""We saw some softness in the tourism market in China,"" Mr. Iger said. ""Not just for us, but across the board."" He added that much of the discounting had ended. ""We still believe very, very, very bullishly"" in the resort, he said. Over all, however, it was a strong quarter for Disney, with each of its biggest divisions — movies, theme parks and television — contributing in a significant way to results, a contrast to a year ago, when movies and television sputtered. Movie operating income more than doubled, to $596 million, because of fewer film-related write-offs and scorching ticket sales for ""Incredibles 2"" and ""Ant-Man and the Wasp."" Disney's theme parks had operating income of $829 million, an 11 percent increase, because of growth at Walt Disney World in Florida, which suffered from Hurricane Irma in 2017. And quarterly profit at Disney's vast television business, which includes ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel and the Freeform network, climbed 9 percent, to $5.96 billion. Results at ESPN were flat; higher subscription fees were offset by a decline in advertising. Lower costs helped Disney Channels Worldwide and Freeform deliver improved results. ABC benefited from sales of reruns for the sitcom ""black-ish,"" but continued to suffer from declining ratings: Increases in political ad revenue were offset by ""lower network impressions."" Disney shares climbed about 1.7 percent in aftermarket trading, to $118."
News,2018-11-09,"WASHINGTON — Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, served on the advisory board of a Florida company that a federal judge shut down last year and fined nearly $26 million after the government accused it of scamming customers.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/politics/whitaker-trump-attorney-general.html,1317," WASHINGTON — Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, served on the advisory board of a Florida company that a federal judge shut down last year and fined nearly $26 million after the government accused it of scamming customers. The company, World Patent Marketing, ""bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars"" by promising inventors lucrative patent agreements, according to a complaint filed in Florida by the Federal Trade Commission. Court documents show that when frustrated consumers tried to get their money back, Scott J. Cooper, the company's president and founder, used Mr. Whitaker to threaten them as a former federal prosecutor. Mr. Cooper's company paid Mr. Whitaker nearly $10,000 before it closed. Mr. Whitaker's role in the company would complicate his confirmation prospects should President Trump nominate him as attorney general. It is not clear if Mr. Trump was aware of Mr. Whitaker's involvement with the patent marketing company before naming him as a replacement for Jeff Sessions, who was ousted by Mr. Trump on Wednesday. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Whitaker's ties to the patent company, which were first reported by The Miami New Times. Before his ascension to the office of the nation's top law enforcement official, Mr. Whitaker, 49, was Mr. Sessions's chief of staff. A conservative Republican from Iowa, he was seen within the Justice Department as a White House loyalist who publicly expressed doubts about the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Mr. Trump or any of his associates conspired in the effort. Mr. Whitaker's appointment has prompted concerns that he might shut down or stymie the special counsel's investigation. In August 2017, Mr. Whitaker highlighted on Twitter a Philly.com opinion article with the headline ""Note to Trump's Lawyer: Do Not Cooperate With Mueller Lynch Mob."" In his tweet, Mr. Whitaker wrote that it was ""worth a read."" Mr. Whitaker also wrote an opinion article that same day for CNN's website with the headline ""Mueller's Investigation of Trump Is Going Too Far."" He said the investigation needed to be limited. Mr. Whitaker, a former college football player, joined the Justice Department in October 2017 after Mr. Trump watched him as a CNN analyst and approved of his television appearances. World Patent Marketing was founded in 2014 and had the hallmarks of a legitimate business. It used a splashy website and other marketing materials to ""create the impression that they have successfully helped other inventors,"" the trade commission said in its complaint. In reality, the commission said, the Miami Beach company failed to make good on almost every promise it made to consumers, and strung them along for months or years after taking their money. When prospective customers left their contact information on the company website, an employee would call them back and follow a script: The company was an ""invention powerhouse"" with an ""incredible advisory board,"" including Mr. Whitaker, a ""former United States attorney who was appointed by President George Bush."" Mr. Whitaker had served as the top prosecutor for the Southern District of Iowa, a position he held until 2009. In joining the board, Mr. Whitaker was quoted in a news release issued by the company as saying that he was honored to be a part of World Patent Marketing because it was a ""trusted partner to many inventors."" In another news release, Mr. Whitaker was quoted as saying that ""as a former U.S. attorney, I would only align myself with a first-class organization."" ""World Patent Marketing,"" the release continued, ""goes beyond making statements about doing business 'ethically' and translates those words into action."" In footage uploaded to Vimeo, a video platform, in 2015, Mr. Whitaker can be seen reviewing an invention meant to reduce razor-blade cuts. Mr. Cooper also posted a picture of himself on social media with a smiling Mr. Whitaker at the company offices in Miami. The trade commission complaint said that consumers were told they had to spend about $3,000 for a ""Global Invention Royalty Analysis"" to begin the process of examining an invention with the goal of getting a patent. After making the payment, the company's clients were then pitched various packages ranging from approximately $8,000 to about $65,000. After the company took the money, it typically began ignoring customers, who became frustrated that they were left in the dark. Mr. Cooper would often berate or threaten them when they asked questions or wanted their money back. ""Defendants and their lawyers have threatened consumers with lawsuits and even criminal charges and imprisonment for making any kind of complaint,"" the trade commission's complaint said. In at least two instances, Mr. Cooper used Mr. Whitaker's former position as a federal prosecutor to rebuff customers. Mr. Whitaker, using his Iowa law firm's email, told a man who had complained to Mr. Cooper that he was a former federal prosecutor and served on the company's board. ""Your emails and message from today seem to be an apparent attempt at possible blackmail or extortion,"" Mr. Whitaker wrote in August 2015. ""You also mentioned filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and to smear World Patent Marketing's reputation online. I am assuming you understand that there could be serious civil and criminal consequences for you."" When another frustrated customer, Rich O'Neill of Montana, emailed around the same time and wanted his $1,300 returned, Mr. Cooper fired back a threatening email. ""You're telling me that if I don't refund your $1,300, you will blackmail me into filing complaints with regulators? And you just put it in writing,"" Mr. Cooper wrote. ""You are aware that we have a former U.S. attorney on our board."" Mr. Cooper returned the money to Mr. O'Neill, who said in an interview on Thursday that he believed the email referencing Mr. Whitaker was meant to intimidate him. The complaint also accused the company of using thuggish tactics, according to court documents. In an email to customers, the company referenced a blog post that described how one person wanted to speak with Mr. Cooper about his invention idea. The post said that the person was intercepted by the company's ""intimidating security team, all ex-Israeli special ops and trained in Krav Maga, one of the most deadly of the martial arts."" The post added, ""The World Patent Marketing Security Team are the kind of guys who are trained to knock out first and ask questions later."" Another customer, Brenda Wilcox, 49, a Trump supporter who lives in Broward County, Fla., said in an interview on Thursday that World Patent Marketing scammed $11,000 from her. She said the company had agreed to market, license and develop a bracelet she invented that would warn drivers if they left a baby in the back seat of their car. Another customer, William Knecht of Texas, lost about $35,000 on a patent package, according to the complaint. ""The entire time I worked with W.P.M. I feel like the company cut corners, did the bare minimum to get by, and were just slimy enough to keep me happy and not complaining,"" Mr. Knecht said in a 2017 statement as part of the trade commission's case. Another customer, Christopher Seaver, a Florida doctor who spent more than $300,000 hoping to make money on an invention, said that Mr. Cooper asked him to be on the advisory board to do consulting work on medical patents. ""I have not made any money from my involvement with W.P.M.,"" Dr. Seaver said in the complaint. ""This has caused financial hardship for me because I paid life savings to W.P.M."" He added, ""I've gotten nothing in return."" This past March, the federal judge, Darrin P. Gayles, banned Mr. Cooper and World Patent Marketing from the invention promotion industry. Mr. Cooper was also ordered to pay the trade commission nearly $1 million, according to court documents. His lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday."
News,2018-11-09,"LANSING, Mich. — There is a tendency for people to define Gretchen Whitmer by who she is not.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/politics/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-governor.html,1642," LANSING, Mich. — There is a tendency for people to define Gretchen Whitmer by who she is not. Ms. Whitmer was not one of the surprising, insurgent Democratic nominees for governor this cycle, as her campaign for Michigan's governorship was flush with money and key endorsements from the outset. She did not have the up-from-nothing background story of some other Democratic candidates; after all, a building in downtown Detroit is named for her father, the former chief executive of Blue Cross Blue Shield. She was not Abdul El-Sayed, the fiery leftist whose campaign for governor captured national attention, but who lost badly to Ms. Whitmer in the primary. And she was not Hillary Clinton, whose 2016 failure in Michigan still reverberates among Democrats throughout the state. But after a nearly 10-point victory Tuesday over the Republican state attorney general, Bill Schuette, Ms. Whitmer is finally getting recognition for who she is: a shrewd politician tailor-made for Michigan, whose pragmatic approach to policymaking has consistently been underrated by opponents in both parties. In the weeks leading up to the election, a slate of new Democratic stars emerged who gained national attention: Andrew Gillum in Florida, Beto O'Rourke in Texas, Stacey Abrams in Georgia. None won on Tuesday — Mr. Gillum's and Ms. Abrams's races have not yet been called — while the Whitmer-led ticket in Michigan soared, flipping two House seats and electing women to key statewide posts. ""The Biggest Democratic Stars Of The Midterms Lost. Here's Who You Should Know About Now,"" read one headline on election night that featured Ms. Whitmer's picture. Ms. Whitmer, 47, has also united a Michigan Democratic Party that was wounded and embarrassed after President Trump's 2016 victory in the state. She buried the pervasive belief that a ticket led by a woman could not succeed in the industrial Midwest, winning over a once-skeptical Detroit community and even some voters who backed Mr. Trump. That's partly because she's the anti-Clinton, said Lon Johnson, former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party. ""I think that Hillary was viewed as a part of the hyper partisanship of this country, and Gretchen is not,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""She's rightly viewed as someone who's reasoned and effective and doesn't join the shouting.'' Ms. Whitmer's folksy appeal was evident during the campaign as she traversed Michigan, an ideologically diverse state that is still rebounding from a recession that considerably damaged its labor-heavy economy. Ms. Whitmer, the former state Democratic Senate leader, leaned on her statehouse connections early in the race. She also diverged from the traditional Democratic formula for the primary — consolidating support in the outer areas of the state before focusing on Detroit later in the cycle. Fueled by her ""Fix the Damn Roads"" bus tour and the belief that Democrats have not adequately reached out to working-class people of all races, Ms. Whitmer visited all 83 Michigan counties: union voters in Macomb County who voted for Mr. Trump, Flint residents still wrestling with the continuing water crisis and teacher unions hobbled by a Republican administration hostile to labor. ""Love you, Gretchen!"" one man called as she headed toward a diner in Lansing, her hometown, a common occurrence for a person who seems to be on a first-name basis with many voters. ""Gretchen is like a football team that just runs the ball and runs the ball and runs the ball,"" said Mark Bernstein, the powerful Democrat and a member of the Board of Regents at the University of Michigan. Ms. Whitmer, a big sports fan who went to college with hopes of being a sideline broadcaster, would appreciate the reference. ""Lots of times people want to see like 30-yard passes or fancy stunt play, but that's just not her style,"" he said. ""This is Michigan, where we respect candidates who campaign how they live and work — and she does that."" Ms. Whitmer described her approach as being ""tethered to the things that matter to people."" ""Part of the failures of past Democratic campaigns, I believe, was in not showing up,"" she said. ""In assuming that you know what people are confronting and what they need and what they expect."" Last month in her Lansing campaign office, Ms. Whitmer outlined some of the defining contours of her life in public service. She credited her parents, a Michigan power couple who worked in state government, with instilling in her a desire to give back to others. She also cited two life-changing experiences as the motivating forces behind her pragmatic approach to policymaking: caring for her dying mother in the early 2000s while she was nursing her first child and being sexually assaulted in college. Ms. Whitmer described the sexual assault in an emotional speech on the floor of the State Senate in 2013, when she opposed the so-called rape insurance bill, which banned insurance coverage for abortion in private health plans unless women purchased a separate rider. The bill passed over her objections, but she views it as an example of how her values inform her political decisions. ""I've come to appreciate that these experiences are what compels me to just come in and fix problems,"" she said. ""It eliminates my patience for anyone who wants to politicize an issue instead of just rolling up their sleeves and getting to work."" Republicans struggled to find a consistent line of attack against Ms. Whitmer. Mr. Schuette, who heavily spent his own money in the governor's race, tried to tie Ms. Whitmer to the tenure of former Gov. Jennifer Granholm, whose administration struggled with a slumping economy and the financial collapse of Detroit during her two terms. Mr. Schuette even called Ms. Whitmer by Ms. Granholm's name in a recent debate, though he quickly corrected himself. ""Maybe Bill Schuette will finally learn my name,"" Ms. Whitmer said at a campaign stop on Election Day. The most lasting criticism of Ms. Whitmer came from Mr. El-Sayed, her primary opponent who later endorsed her. In a recent interview, Mr. El-Sayed said ""it's no secret"" that his definition of a progressive differs from Ms. Whitmer's. He also said Ms. Whitmer's establishment ties significantly helped her in the primary. ""I think she was really effective at being able to leverage her influence with insiders in the party to keep other people out of the race"" who would have eaten into her vote, he said. ""She was up against it. And a lot of folks were worried about what her candidacy would mean."" Mr. El-Sayed consistently chided Ms. Whitmer on health care. Though Ms. Whitmer was integral in helping Michigan expand Medicaid in 2013, she refused to back the Medicare-for-all proposal that Mr. El-Sayed and other progressive stalwarts attributed to her close connection with the health care industry and companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield. Ms. Whitmer bristles at the establishment label and said she simply refused to overpromise things to voters she did not feel the current system can deliver. ""You can be both progressive and want to get things done — they're not mutually exclusive and that's what I bring,"" she said. The establishment label sticks particularly well to Ms. Whitmer, a product of a powerhouse Michigan family. Her mother, Sherry, was a Democrat and a top lawyer in the attorney general's office. Richard Whitmer, her father, led the state Department of Commerce in a Republican administration before leading Blue Cross Blue Shield as C.E.O. for years. The eldest of three children, Ms. Whitmer had dreams of covering sports for ESPN or a local television station that were upended after she took an internship with a local representative in Lansing, she said. She then decided to forgo broadcasting and enter Michigan State's law school, igniting a political awakening that coincided with her parents' rise to prominence in statehouse politics. She won her first primary election for the State House of Representatives less than three years after graduating from law school, kick-starting her political ascent that culminated with her becoming the first woman to lead a party caucus in Michigan's Senate. Republicans have criticized Ms. Whitmer for being a lifelong politician and failing to sponsor significant legislation while in the statehouse. They have also said that in her next job after leaving the legislature, as Ingham County prosecutor, she failed to aggressively investigate Lawrence G. Nassar, the former Michigan State gymnastics doctor who was later convicted of charges of sexual molestation and child pornography. Ms. Whitmer has said she pursued the necessary charges based on the information she was given at the time, and the Nassar case was eventually taken out of her jurisdiction. She also notes that she made several reforms to the prosecutor's office in her six-month tenure, including opening a unit dedicated to investigating domestic violence. Political experts in Michigan point to the Medicaid expansion as a defining moment for her bipartisan credentials. Some Democrats in 2013 were torn about whether to work with the Republican governor, Rick Snyder, such a key legislative accomplishment, but Ms. Whitmer gained fans throughout the state for her willingness to put policy over politics. Debbie Stabenow, the Michigan senator who won re-election Tuesday, credits Ms. Whitmer for helping women secure victories across the ticket. Ms. Stabenow said it was especially important to do so by emphasizing their job qualifications, not their gender. ""Sooner or later in American history this moment was going to come, where women were stepping forward and being recognized as the most qualified candidate,"" Ms. Stabenow said, as Aretha Franklin's ""R-E-S-P-E-C-T"" blared from Ms. Whitmer's campaign bus on Tuesday. ""And that didn't happen because we were in a back room and planned this together, but because each of us ran on our own merits."" The next song in the queue was Ms. Whitmer's favorite: Lizzo's women's empowerment anthem, ""Good as Hell."" ""Boss up and change your life,"" the future governor sang. ""You can have it all, no sacrifice."""

Another mass shooting in the U.S., a century since the Armistice, and how the Mandarin duck got its name.  Here's the latest: • A mass shooting in California. Investigators were searching for clues to why a former Marine armed with a .45-caliber handgun, legally obtained, opened fire at a crowded dance hall in Thousand Oaks, Calif., on Wednesday night, killing 12 people. He was identified as Ian D. Long, 28, a combat veteran. He had served in Afghanistan and was later evaluated for post-traumatic stress. But the authorities said they had determined that he posed no threat. He died after being confronted by police officers, including one who became his victim, Sgt. Ron Helus. Sergeant Helus was honored Thursday in the procession seen above. Some of the hundreds of the people in the club had survived the mass shooting at a country music festival last year in Las Vegas, where 58 people were killed. _____ • 100 years after the Armistice.  Dozens of world leaders will commemorate the end of World War I in France this weekend, and President Emmanuel Macron, above, hopes the occasion puts them in mind of the dangers of nationalism. But as he gets ready to inherit de facto leadership of the E.U. from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Mr. Macron is a diminished figure. On the world stage, he has few allies in defending immigration and liberal governance. In Europe, he is despised by rising populist movements. At home, his policies and aristocratic image are putting people off. Mr. Macron recently likened this era to the one between the world wars. Analysts told us he'll have to do a better job of grappling with discontent if he hopes to change the Continent's course. _____ • Another jam-packed day in American politics.  To justify the White House's unusual move of barring the CNN reporter Jim Acosta, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders falsely claimed he had laid hands on a staff member, above right, during a contentious presidential news conference. Ms. Sanders circulated misleadingly edited video of the encounter that came from an infamous conspiracy website. Meanwhile, the Trump administration claimed vast authority to deny asylum to virtually any migrant who crosses the border illegally. And there were new details about the acting attorney general, Mark Whitaker, a skeptic of the Russia investigation who is now tasked with overseeing it. He was on the advisory board of a company accused of bilking customers and has criticized the Supreme Court's power of judicial review, a foundational principle of American government. _____ • What brought down Lion Air Flight 610? We've had reporters around the world consulting investigators, pilots and aviation experts, trying to understand what may have caused a new Boeing jet to crash into the Java Sea last week, at the cost of 189 lives. What they've been able to reconstruct is an end that would have been terrifying but swift. The single-aisle Boeing aircraft appears to have plummeted nose-first at as much as 400 m.p.h., striking the waves in less than a minute. And it's become clear that there might have been a whole cascade of problems — including erroneous data, a burst of confusing alarms in the cockpit and the culture at Lion Air, an Indonesian airline. _____ • Google overhauls its sexual misconduct policy. The technology giant said it would end forced arbitration for sexual harassment or assault claims, days after more than 20,000 of its employees around the world, prompted by a Times investigation, walked out in protest of how the company handles cases of sexual misconduct.

The duck, above, a native to East Asia that quickly became a star on social media, is a yuānyang (鸳鸯) in China. In English, it's a Mandarin duck. Why? The fowl's vibrant plumage recalls the dress of government bureaucrats centuries ago, called mandarins in the West. The same connection applied to the dialect those officials used. Even mandarin oranges got the linguistic overlay. But mandarin is not a Chinese word. Its etymology is disputed. Some say that during the Qing dynasty, visiting Westerners heard people calling government officials of the ruling class ""mǎn dàrén"" (满大人): Manchu for ""big man"" or ""boss."" Others say that the term comes from ""menteri,"" the Malay for ""court councilor"" or ""minister,"" and that the 16th-century Portuguese who used Malaysia as a stepping stone into China wrote it as ""mandarin."" The little duck in Central Park has been solo, but in China, its cousins are believed to be lifelong couples. There is a saying: A pair of Mandarin ducks is more enviable than an immortal.

News,2018-11-09,"MANILA — A Philippine court on Friday sentenced Imelda R. Marcos, the country’s flamboyant former first lady, to a minimum of 42 years in prison for creating private foundations to hide her unexplained wealth.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/world/asia/imelda-marcos-sentenced-philippines.html,720," MANILA — A Philippine court on Friday sentenced Imelda R. Marcos, the country's flamboyant former first lady, to a minimum of 42 years in prison for creating private foundations to hide her unexplained wealth. But it is unlikely that Ms. Marcos, a 89-year-old widow, will see any jail time. The court, which handles graft and public corruption cases, said the ruling could be appealed, and legal experts have said Ms. Marcos could fight a prison sentence because of her advanced age. The sentence comes as Mrs. Marcos and her family have seen a political resurgence in the Philippines, having gained favor under the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte. The court found her guilty of seven counts of graft, with each count punishable by a minimum of six years in prison. The ruling also automatically disqualifies Mrs. Marcos, who is a congresswoman, from holding any public office. Mrs. Marcos did not appear in court for the sentencing, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. In a statement later Friday, Mrs. Marcos said her lawyer was studying the ruling and intended to file a motion asking the court to reconsider it. The lengthy sentence drew praise from some leading opponents of Mr. Duterte, who has in the past praised the brutal dictatorship of Mrs. Marcos's deceased husband, Ferdinand Marcos. Loretta Ann Rosales, the country's former human rights commissioner, who was tortured as an activist in the 1970s for opposing Mr. Marcos, called the sentence a symbolic victory for the thousands who died resisting the dictatorship. ""I am literally jumping with joy,"" Ms. Rosales said in an interview. She said the ruling showed that there were still public corruption judges ""who have helped keep the candles lit through these dark nights and pursued the truth."" She said the ruling also proved that the Marcoses and their cronies were guilty of raiding government coffers in order to enjoy a lavish lifestyle while millions of Filipinos lived in poverty. Neither Mrs. Marcos nor her lawyers could immediately be reached for comment. The charges against Mrs. Marcos took more than a quarter-century to prosecute, largely because many people who could have been witnesses had died or were too old to testify. The charges were filed in 1991, when state prosecutors accused Mrs. Marcos of creating private foundations in Switzerland and having financial interests in several companies when she was governor of Manila between 1978 and 1984. Prosecutors said the fake firms hid money that her family stole from the government. The prosecutors wrapped up their presentation in 2015, but Mrs. Marcos's lawyers successfully delayed the hearings by not appearing in court. Among those who testified against Mrs. Marcos was Frank Chaves, the country's late solicitor general, who filed a sworn statement that said Mrs. Marcos had used the foundations in Switzerland to hide millions of dollars of stolen wealth. The government successfully recovered some $658 million that the Marcoses held in Swiss financial institutions. But officials believe that is just a fraction of the roughly $10 billion they say the Marcoses stole from the Philippines. Ferdinand Marcos's two-decade rule was ended by the 1986 ""people power"" revolution. The Marcoses were sent into exile in Hawaii, where Mr. Marcos died three years later. The family was subsequently allowed to return home, where they re-established a base in their hometown, Ilocos Norte, in the northern Philippines. The Marcoses' political fortunes surged after Mr. Duterte was elected president two years ago. Mr. Duterte, who often describes himself as a fan of the late dictator, has credited the Marcos family with consolidating support for him in the north. In 2016, he allowed Mr. Marcos's remains to be reburied in a heroes' cemetery in Manila, leading toprotests. Mr. Duterte has also backed Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s appeal of his narrow loss in the vice-presidential election that year. A spokesman for Mr. Duterte, Salvador Panelo, said Friday that the president respected the court's decision. ""While we note that there are still legal remedies available to Congresswoman Marcos, this latest development underscores that our country currently has a working and impartial justice system that favors no one,"" Mr. Panelo said. One of the Marcoses' daughters, Imee Marcos, is running next year for the Philippine Senate. She recently refused demands by rights groups that she apologize for her father's atrocities, calling on the public to ""move on."""
News,2018-11-09,"MANCHESTER, England — The problem with Manchester City, as Arsène Wenger saw it, was not simply that it possessed an apparently bottomless well of wealth. It was that City was smart, too. “Petrol and ideas,” as Wenger, the former Arsenal manager, put it. “Money and quality.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/sports/manchester-city-united-football-leaks.html,1780," MANCHESTER, England — The problem with Manchester City, as Arsène Wenger saw it, was not simply that it possessed an apparently bottomless well of wealth. It was that City was smart, too. ""Petrol and ideas,"" as Wenger, the former Arsenal manager, put it. ""Money and quality."" Wenger, of course, spent much of his career railing against soccer's inexorable drift into the grasp of oligarchs and plutocrats, vainly espousing the virtues of sustainability as the game swooned before leveraged billionaires and sovereign investment funds. It was Wenger who first introduced the idea of ""financial doping"" to the sport, preaching parsimony during a gold rush. By the end, though, even he did not believe City's success could be explained solely by its balance sheet. Its pre-eminence could not have been achieved without the billion-plus pounds provided by its backer, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, but it would not have been so complete had that money not been spent so wisely. The most obvious manifestation of that has been on the field: Pep Guardiola's team won the Premier League last season with more points and more goals than any team in the modern era. It did so with such style, such ruthless élan that England as a whole will ""forever be grateful"" for Guardiola's presence, as the former striker Gary Lineker put it. When England's national team reached the semifinals of the World Cup last summer, many credited Guardiola, at least in part, for helping to smooth the introduction of a more modern approach. Off the field, though, the modern City has also become a point of reference to many. City Football Group, the umbrella organization that owns City and its interlinked network of sister clubs, has been consulted by the Chinese Super League on how to run its teams more sustainably. In the United States, in particular, Major League Soccer has made use of the vast database of information held by City's recruitment department when assessing potential signings from minor European leagues. Even Real Madrid, a club more accustomed to leading than following, was impressed by City's model. Executives from the Santiago Bernabéu told City's chief executive, Ferran Soriano, that it was not something they could copy — Real's prestige would be diluted by franchising, they felt — but they admired the concept. Like everyone else in soccer, they accepted that City was about more than just oil: it had ideas, too. Increasingly, it seems as though that combination is simply too much for the rest of the Premier League. Guardiola's team has dropped only four points this season; it remains on course to equal, or beat, its points total from last year. It will go into Sunday's derby against Manchester United as a firm favorite; United, for so long the shadow City could not escape, now seems the underdog. On Tuesday, Guardiola was asked if the league as a whole would eventually suffer for City's unimpeachable excellence. ""I don't know,"" he said, ""if it's a problem."" Similar success in the Champions League, the competition its executives — if not its fans — cherish more than any other, has proved more elusive. City does not need the trophy, though, to know that it has already joined Europe's front rank of teams. In the documents released by the opaque whistle-blowing platform Football Leaks to the German magazine Der Spiegel, five Premier League clubs were named as party to a plan to launch a breakaway European Super League — replacing the Champions League — starting in 2021. City was among them. The petrol, and the ideas, have brought City to the head table. Those documents, though, have painted an entirely different picture of City from the one that had convinced so many of its opponents to follow its example. In a weeklong exposé of the methods the club has used to circumvent UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations — to, in a comment attributed to Simon Pearce, one of the club's most influential executives, ""do what we want"" — Der Spiegel and Football Leaks have depicted a club that has, for almost a decade, worked tirelessly to deceive and co-opt the game's authorities, to make sure the rules do not apply to City; and whenever it has not gotten its way, it has reacted with petulant anger. There are details of inflated sponsorship deals designed to mask covert cash injections from the club's owners; of closed payment loops with spurious third-party companies for players' image rights; of a former manager's salary that seems, at least in part, to have been bolstered by an ""advisory"" role with another club owned by Sheikh Mansour; of a secret partnership with a Danish team that may have breached rules on a club's influence; of legal threats toward not only UEFA but to the accounting firm sent in to examine the club's accounts; and of back-room deals with Gianni Infantino, at the time the general secretary of UEFA and now the most powerful man at FIFA. Nobody comes out of the revelations well: not Infantino, craven and crawling; not UEFA, willing to prosecute the minnows while the sharks swim free; not the clubs, led by Bayern Munich, who talked of leaving not only UEFA but FIFA itself in search of more money; not Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, who has called for those guilty of ""dirty tricks"" to be punished, which would coincidentally help several of the teams in his competition; not the clubs or organizations who should be righteously angry at flagrant rule breaches but who have maintained the silence of the complicit; and certainly not City — or, for that matter, Paris Saint-Germain — who signed up to a set of rules and promptly searched for ways to break them. The New York Times has not seen the source documents Der Spiegel has obtained, and cannot verify them. But City has not declared any of the information reported so far to be false. It has simply dismissed the documents as a ""clear and organized attempt"" to smear the club's reputation. It might also point out, of course, that it has already been punished for failing to comply with Financial Fair Play — 60 million euros (about $68 million) in 2014, though some of it was suspended or subsequently refunded — even if, as the documents show, intensive lobbying meant that fine was substantially lighter than it might have been. The documents suggest City is likely to believe that relief was justified, too. The club has hardly made a secret of the fact it felt Financial Fair Play was a ruse concocted by the game's traditional elite to keep upstarts like City and P.S.G. in their place. If City was trying to find a way around the rules, it was only because the rules were unfair. Besides, even if the allegations are true, and tens or hundreds of millions of dollars more were injected into City than the club's accounts recorded, that does not change the fundamental truth, the one even Wenger recognized: That money alone is not enough. That, certainly, is Guardiola's view. ""When I was at Barcelona and in Germany, always I heard that Manchester City just has money,"" he said this week. ""You have to accept it when people say you win just because of money. We believe that we work a lot: not just the manager, the staff and the players. If people say it is about money, we accept it, but that point of view is completely wrong. We work a lot, in a good way, and that is why I always defend us."" City, in other words, has petrol and ideas. There is, though, a broader issue here, one that stretches beyond whether City has been punished enough, or whether F.F.P. was well-conceived in the first place. To zoom in on those issues is to get lost in the weeds. Even as City — like P.S.G. — reportedly poured considerable time, effort and expense into breaking UEFA's regulations, it was simultaneously meeting any threat of a punishment with ire and anger, contemplating whether any potential fine might be better spent on a legal team to take on, and crush, the organization levying it. When the sum it would be forced to pay was eventually decided, City could afford to declare that tens of millions of euros did not ""materially affect"" its business. That is the true image cast by the revelations of the last week, one that has ramifications far beyond tribal self-interest: of not just one club, but of a whole host of them that believe the rules should be altered to fit their needs; of teams so inflated by success that they can now casually disregard the diktats of their governing bodies; of teams too big to fail, beyond control. That is what led City both to deceive and then disdain UEFA. It is what led to the endless changes to the Champions League and the tweaks to domestic cup competitions and a series of bans for illegally approaching, or signing, young players: an essential arrogance, a disregard for consequence, a belief that might makes right. It is what threatens the fundamental rupture in the fabric of the game best reflected in that Bayern-concocted plot for a breakaway super league that would involve pulling players out of all international soccer, including the World Cup. Perhaps it is understandable that City tried to circumvent a set of rules designed, to a large extent, specifically to protect the teams it was trying to usurp. Perhaps it was justified in fighting, tooth and nail, the idea that it might be punished by what it considers a rigged system. Perhaps UEFA got lucky that it did not go to court. Perhaps, too, it would be evidence of a skewed morality to condemn City's owners for all of that but not for the allegations of human rights abuses and oppression they have overseen in the United Arab Emirates. But to turn a blind eye to that, as the game's authorities seem likely to do, is to help yet again usher in a game with one rule for the rich and another for the poor; a game of governing bodies that cower at the trembling fist of the great and the good; a game of teams who decide which rules suit them, and when, and of authorities who act at the behest of their most powerful subjects and fans that contort themselves to praise actions that might otherwise draw scorn. It is to embrace a game that is not being run in the interests of the many, but the few, and a world where the quality of an idea is no match for a quantity of petrol."

How big a problem is homelessness in your neighborhood or community?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/learning/would-you-let-a-homeless-person-live-in-your-backyard.html,599," Do you or your family know anyone who is homeless? How big a problem is homelessness in your neighborhood or community? In ""A Novel Solution for the Homeless: House Them in Backyards,"" Jennifer Medina explores a bold new pilot program in Los Angeles to offer incentives to homeowners to provide shelter to the homeless in their backyards: Faced with a major housing crisis, Los Angeles is trying out an idea that some hope is so wild it just might work: helping homeowners build small homes in their backyards and rent them to people who have spent months living in their cars, in shelters or on the streets. Both the county and the city of Los Angeles are beginning pilot programs to give homeowners subsidies to create housing for the homeless. Similar experiments are also underway in Seattle and Portland. Though housing the homeless in your backyard might be considered extreme, thousands of residents on the West Coast have indicated they are interested in doing just that. ""It's part of our daily life now — you're always either walking or driving past someone who is homeless,"" said Ms. Chavarria, a 37-year-old single mother who works in human resources. She has volunteered at soup kitchens and contributed to food drives but more often has felt helpless about the seemingly intractable problem. ""If we can be part of doing something, why would I not want to do that?"" she said. ""I'm not religious, but I am spiritual, and I have this belief that when God blesses you, it's to bless someone else."" While officials hope that homeowners like Ms. Chavarria will be motivated by good will, they also plan to prod them by offering subsidies. A pilot program run by Los Angeles County will give assistance to a handful of homeowners who are willing to build. Ms. Chavarria was one of more than 500 homeowners who applied for the program. Once the unit she is building is rented, she expects to earn $1,500 a month, paid for through a Section 8 voucher or some other rental assistance program. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — Would you let a homeless person live in your backyard? Why or why not? — What responsibility do we all have to others who are facing difficult situations — in this case, people who do not have a home? Melina Chavarria, one of the homeowners participating in the pilot, said, ""If we can be part of doing something, why would I not want to do that?"" She continued, ""I'm not religious, but I am spiritual, and I have this belief that when God blesses you, it's to bless someone else."" Do you find her reasons persuasive? — While the central goal of the program is to provide a home for someone who does not have one, do you think participants might get additional benefits — beyond financial incentives — by housing someone else in their backyard? What might some of these benefits be? — What does your community do to help alleviate the issue of homelessness? Do you think these actions are effective? Why or why not? — How effective do you think this pilot program will be? What might it be able to accomplish that traditional approaches might not? — Currently, the pilot is in Los Angeles, with similar experiments in Seattle and Portland. Should all cities adopt this novel approach? Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

News,2018-11-09,The United States has been engaged in land wars in the Middle East for so long that it’s easy to forget some of our nation’s most significant battles have been fought at sea. Two good new books remind us of the importance of maritime warfare in our national history.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/books/review/nathaniel-philbrick-in-the-hurricanes-eye.html,2322," The United States has been engaged in land wars in the Middle East for so long that it's easy to forget some of our nation's most significant battles have been fought at sea. Two good new books remind us of the importance of maritime warfare in our national history. Nathaniel Philbrick demonstrates once again with IN THE HURRICANE'S EYE: The Genius of George Washington and the Victory at Yorktown (Viking, $30) that he is a masterly storyteller. Here he seeks to elevate the naval battles between the French and British to a central place in the history of the American Revolution. He succeeds, marvelously. He can relate in a word or two what others might take a chapter to expound. For example, his phrase ""Washington's tightly coiled response"" captures the tense tone of much of Washington's wartime correspondence. Nor is Philbrick afraid to make sweeping assertions. He writes that ""the bitter truth was that by the summer of 1781 the American Revolution had failed,"" in that it was a stalemate that many Americans no longer supported physically or financially. Victory would be secured, he continues, not by Americans but by French funds, guns, ships and soldiers. (Philbrick also does hurricanes well.) On top of that, at a time when many books of military history have poor maps or none, this book has many, all of them instructive and graceful. As a writer, I'm envious of Philbrick's talents, but as a reader, I'm grateful. Trent Hone's LEARNING WAR: The Evolution of Fighting Doctrine in the U.S. Navy, 1898-1945 (Naval Institute, $34.95) is quite the opposite, a dry volume written for military professionals. But there is a place for such works, especially when they show how organizational change can be the key to victory. Hone examines the United States Navy of World War II through his lens as a management consultant. Sample: ""The Pacific Fleet would not advance as a monolith; it would attack as a distributed network."" Personalities do not loom large in his tale. The real hero here is not an individual but a large, complex organization, the American Navy, that quickly grew from second-rate status to become the world's premier maritime force. Even so, Hone tells the story of the 1942-43 Guadalcanal campaign particularly well. That history is often related from the Marine Corps's point of view, which in painful summary is that the Navy ran away and left the Marines to fight it out alone against the Japanese. As Hone tells it, Navy commanders knew they were outmatched by the Japanese but also recognized that Guadalcanal was a decisive campaign of the Pacific War. Understanding those stakes, they engaged in suicidal missions in an effort to keep the Japanese Navy from bombarding the Marine airfield on the island and also from landing reinforcements. But the most intriguing chapter is Hone's study of a critical but largely unrecognized reorganization that transformed Navy operations beginning in late 1942. The problem was that commanders of warships were being cognitively overwhelmed by all the new information thrown at them in battle. In addition to traditional sightings and signaling, they were now receiving reports by radio from aircraft and from other ships, as well as from radar readings. The Navy's answer was to design a new Combat Information Center on each ship. Through it, all that data could be continually funneled, sifted, integrated and passed to the captain and others on the vessel who might need it, like gunners. Such an improvement may seem mere common sense, but then many great innovations do seem obvious — in retrospect. Interestingly, Adm. Chester Nimitz told skippers what to do (establish the new centers) but not how to do it. This meant that different ships devised different approaches, which provided the basis for subsequent refinements. Hone's history is good as it goes, but it would have been better had he also addressed the Navy's clear failures of the time. For example, it seemed unable to devise an effective response to the German U-boat campaign along the East Coast in 1942. Also, it went into the war having developed a deeply flawed torpedo, the Mark 14, which among other things often failed to detonate, and sometimes ran 10 feet deeper than intended and so passed under enemy warships. These problems seem to raise a few doubts about Hone's thesis that the Navy went into the war as an innovative, flexible organization brilliant at learning from its mistakes and so able to address them quickly. Three other new books are seemingly obscure, but actually quite illuminating. I've been a student of the American military for nearly three decades, but until I picked up AFRICAN AMERICAN OFFICERS IN LIBERIA: A Pestiferous Rotation, 1910-1942 (Potomac, paper, $21.95), I didn't know that for several decades in the early 20th century, the United States Army had a training, advising and leading mission in Liberia. What's more, most of the officers who carried out the mission were black Americans. Brian G. Shellum, a retired Army tank and intelligence officer, does a workmanlike job of relating this neglected tale. The American effort in Liberia had a dual purpose: to fend off encroaching colonial powers, but also to help the 15,000 former American slaves who colonized Liberia to subjugate the approximately 730,000 indigenous people who resented the newcomers. One of the most effective American advisers was Col. Charles Young, who was born a slave in Kentucky in 1864, fought for the Army in the Philippines, was briefly acting superintendent of Sequoia National Park, was active in the N.A.A.C.P. and wound up serving repeated tours in Africa. The book is instructive in the multiple hazards and difficulties of foreign training missions. Liberian government officials wanted to have a military force, but feared having one that was too effective. In a terrible irony, at one point they shunted aside the American advisers and used their own troops to round up indigenous people, who then were shipped to forced labor camps elsewhere in West Africa. It's not often that a work of medieval military history reminds me of a minor BBC comedy show, but that's the case with THE VIKING WARS: War and Peace in King Alfred's Britain, 789-955 (Pegasus, $29.95), by Max Adams. Reading this quirky book, with its heavy reliance on the evidence of coins (where they were minted, what king was depicted on them, what dates they carried, where they were unearthed), brought to mind ""Detectorists,"" a charming television series made a few years ago about the loves and feuds of two amateur archaeologists in eastern England. Adams's book isn't really a military history, and his publisher has done him no favor with the book's American title. It was published last year in Britain as ""Ælfred's Britain: War and Peace in the Viking Age,"" which is a more accurate description. Battles do not figure largely in it, but the reasons for war and their outcomes do. This is an enjoyable book, but it is also very English. At times it feels as if it is veering into Old English, as when Adams, an archaeologist, relates that ""the king of Brycheiniog in southern Wales killed an abbot, called Ecgbehrt, with his companions, provoking the vengeful wrath of the Myrcna hlaefdige. She sent a force to his llys at Brecenanmere, the crannog on Llangorse lake, stormed it and captured his queen."" For all that, Adams doesn't have much to say about the fact that the Norsemen ultimately prevailed, a century after this book closes, with a successful invasion of England in 1066 by William the Conqueror, a descendant of the Viking raider Hrolfr, a.k.a. Rollo. The question of how wars are financed is about as far as one can get from traditional military history about great generals and decisive battles. Yet funding is, of course, essential to conducting almost any war. And as Sarah E. Kreps, the author of TAXING WARS: The American Way of War Finance and the Decline of Democracy (Oxford University, $29.95), points out, war taxes are an especially American issue, given that the United States was founded partly as a result of disputes with Britain over payment of the costs of the French and Indian War, and of the continuing defense of the Colonies. But the financing of wars has become a peculiar political issue nowadays, notes Kreps, a former Air Force officer who teaches government at Cornell University. While our recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been controversial, she observes, how we pay for them has not been. Despite our current partisan polarization, politicians of neither party raise the issue much. She concludes that there now exists a broad, quiet political consensus to insulate the American people from the human and financial costs of their wars. This agreement is insidious, she writes, because it has undermined democratic accountability. One complaint: A volume written by an Ivy League professor and published by Oxford University Press should not contain historical howlers. Two that I noticed: She has Harry Truman losing to Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, and refers to ""the Tea Party Massacre and the origins of the American Revolution,"" a seeming conflation of the Boston Massacre of 1770 and the same city's Tea Party three years later. What does William T. Sherman's march through Georgia in 1864 have to do with today's controversy over Confederate monuments? Lots, I think. The monuments quarrel grows in part out of an incomplete understanding of our past. Monument supporters charge that taking them down reduces our history, but the problem is that many of the people involved in the controversy simply don't know enough history. Imagine, for example, if Southern plantations were more accurately called ""slave labor camps."" Would young lovers then still dream of being married in such places? Likewise, Sherman's march continues to be misunderstood. Contrary to what many Americans still believe, and some are taught, its violence was not indiscriminate. Rather, Sherman was quite precise in directing it against the property (but not the persons) of wealthy Southern die-hards whose assets had been largely untouched by war. Nor was the campaign particularly bloody. As J. D. Dickey notes in RISING IN FLAMES: Sherman's March and the Fight for a New Nation (Pegasus, $29.95), Sherman's casualty rate from campaigning through enemy-held territory for several weeks was minuscule, less than 600 out of 62,000 men. But Sherman did achieve his goal of eviscerating Southern morale, both at home and at the front, where rebel officers realized that their families and homes were unprotected. By doing that, Sherman helped bring an end to the war. He should be ranked among our top five generals, ever. Dickey, the author of ""Empire of Mud,"" looks at the march mainly through the eyes of soldiers and other participants, like nurses. Perhaps as a result of this perspective, he tends to overemphasize the role of subordinate commanders like John Logan, while underestimating Sherman's extraordinary ability to juggle troop movements, logistics and intelligence, all while adapting to a new way of war built around the railroad and the telegraph. So ""Rising in Flames,"" while interesting, is unlikely to take a place alongside essential texts like Joseph T. Glatthaar's ""The March to the Sea and Beyond."" Speaking of Glatthaar, his new book, THE AMERICAN MILITARY: A Concise History (Oxford University, $18.95), carries precisely the right title. In just 127 small pages of text, Glatthaar, a historian at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, gallops through American military history from the French and Indian War all the way to Iraq and Afghanistan. Impressively, he manages to provide a lot more than battle histories, deftly delving into technological advances, social changes and political contexts. Anyone looking for a place to begin understanding the military history of our country would do well to start here. It is all too easy to forget the costs of war for the people who wage it. Some 2.5 million Americans have served in Afghanistan and Iraq. In AFTER COMBAT: True War Stories From Iraq and Afghanistan (Potomac, $29.95), Marian Eide and Michael Gibler seek to construct one big narrative from interviews with 30 veterans about their experiences in those countries. Does this approach work? Yes, and far better than I expected. I finished this book wishing that there were companion volumes for the American Revolution and the Civil War. Eide, an English professor at Texas A&M, and Gibler, a former Army officer, have compiled what amounts to a primer on what it was like to be enlisted in the Army in the post-9/11 era. People who know the military won't be surprised by much, but others can learn a lot from it. And there are still some illuminating surprises. I've covered military operations as a reporter in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, yet I'd never before heard about a kind of ""mortar bingo,"" in which soldiers would bet on where enemy mortar shells would next hit their base. ""After Combat"" captures the odd humor of war. Also, I hadn't before seen this observation from one soldier: ""Most of the platoons had people on suicide watch. … It was the powerlessness, and suicide is one way of getting power back. Suddenly, you're in control again; you can do something. … Part of it is they see violence as a solution."" Finally, it offers a line true in any war: ""It was really boring and then really stressful."" For female soldiers, a major stressor was internal. One comments that ""there was no training about how to deal with the constant advances."" Only one line in the book made me shake my head. I generally appreciated the tone of the editors, which is neither mawkish nor militaristic. But at one point they assert that it is polite for civilians to say to veterans, ""Thank you for your service."" Some vets I know don't mind that phrase, but some others hate it. I think it is better to simply say, ""Welcome home."""
News,2018-11-09,"For some, only new will do.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/realestate/something-new-for-1-million.html,2075," For some, only new will do. With fashionable finishes, trendy technology and a cruise ship's worth of amenities — as well as auras untainted by previous occupants — freshly constructed apartments make the best homes for these buyers. But with an average sale price that exceeds $4 million in Manhattan, or more than twice the $1.6 million average for previously lived-in units, brand-new condominiums can feel out of reach to all but a few. Today's sluggish market, however, is challenging that assumption. Under pressure, some developers are scrapping their original plans and switching out ultraexpensive units for smaller, less pricey versions. At the same time, neighborhoods where condos were once scarce, like Bushwick in Brooklyn and Rockaway Park in Queens, are now seeing projects with below-average prices. What that means is that many snazzy new market-rate condos can now be had for less than $1 million, although that seven-figure cutoff might seem like an only-in-New-York definition of a deal. ""Think about it: We're talking about $1 million as being affordable. Where else in your life would you do that?"" said Klara Madlin, the broker handling sales at the Highbridge, a 39-unit condo from HAP Investments in Washington Heights, at 448 West 167th Street, where every apartment falls in that price range. Eight units remain. (Sales started in 2014, then stopped for several years because of construction issues before resuming about a year ago.) Adam America Real Estate is one developer that adjusted an offering plan for one of its Brooklyn buildings as the market turned. In 2015, when Adam America bought a site at 308 North Seventh Street in Williamsburg, the company envisioned a building with 38 apartments, including 15 three-bedrooms, said Tomer Yogev, Adam America's head of development. But about a year ago Mr. Yogev noticed that buyers were beginning to shy away from pricier apartments at a different condominium he was marketing in Williamsburg, so he decided to reconfigure the building at North Seventh Street, also known as N7. He eliminated some three-bedrooms, shrank the size of the two-bedrooms and increased the number of one-bedrooms. Today, N7, which is next to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, has 45 units: 20 of them one-bedrooms, 20 two-bedrooms and just five three-bedrooms.  Most critical, Mr. Yogev said, is that 17 of the apartments, which Douglas Elliman Real Estate began marketing in September, are priced at $1 million or less. ""We wanted to let buyers enjoy something in their price range,"" he said. In general, Brooklyn seems to be a good place to look for the under-$1 million condo. Last month, Kings County had 197 market-rate condos in that range, according to StreetEasy. About three dozen of those units are in Bushwick, where midsize modernist developments like 267 Evergreen Avenue, an eight-unit condominium from HomeLand Property Group, coexist with shabbier buildings, like the shuttered deli the condo faces. Seven apartments there were listed for under $1 million when the building started sales in August. By last month, half had sold, said Daniel Fried, an Elliman agent who represents the building, where vented stoves, sliding wood balcony doors and distant views of Manhattan are highlights. As Mr. Fried put it, ""One million dollars is a psychological threshold.""  It also may be a financial Rubicon: New York slaps a one-percent ""mansion tax"" on transactions over $1 million, and that extra $10,000 or more is a fee many buyers try to avoid. But to stay on the affordable side of that line, they may have to take a chance on a neighborhood where coffee shops, sit-down restaurants and other mainstays of more popular neighborhoods are limited. ""It's happening, but it's not quite there yet,"" said Marty Hanna, a broker at the Bedrock agency, as he gazed out a window at 1370 Bushwick Avenue, a five-story non-doorman building at the corner of Decatur Street from Urban View Development Group. All 10 apartments at No. 1370, which have oak floors and quartz counters, are priced under $1 million; two-bedrooms that went on the market this summer started at $550,000. Three units are in contract. But even prime Brooklyn neighborhoods are not out of the question. Consider Downtown Brooklyn, where Extell Development Company is at work on Brooklyn Point, the condo portion of the City Point mixed-use development on Flatbush. At the 720-foot tower, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, 24 of the 458 units are studios, 23 of which are listed for under $1 million. The studios, which average about 550 square feet, start at $850,000.  Potentially sweetening any deal, Extell executives said, is the building's 25-year tax abatement, a rarity after the state's 421-a affordable housing program did away with abatements for most condos in a 2017 revamp. Under the abatement, buyers at Brooklyn Point will owe no property taxes for two decades, the equivalent of about $11,000 a year in savings for studios.  Brooklyn Point, Extell's first Brooklyn project, has 40,000 square feet of amenities, including a lounge with a wine bar and a wraparound terrace, a 35-foot climbing wall and a rooftop infinity pool that takes in Manhattan's skyline. Around the corner is a competitor, 11 Hoyt, a pale, cast-concrete spire from Tishman Speyer with 481 apartments. Of them, 116 studios and one-bedrooms are currently priced at $1 million or less, said Erik Rose, a Tishman managing director, although prices could increase soon. Many of those units have unusual bumped-out windows that offer a ledge on which to sit. The apartments also have lava-stone counters and Bosch appliances. ""We wanted to bring high design to Brooklyn,"" Mr. Rose said. The building also has 55,000 square feet of amenities, including an indoor pool, a squash court, music rehearsal rooms, a test kitchen and an elevated park of more than a half acre.  The $3 million to $10 million bracket for condos is hurting across the city, but at this condominium, where units average $1.7 million, or about $1,600 a square foot, ""traffic has been exceptional,"" Mr. Rose said, although he declined to provide sales statistics. Queens had more than six dozen new condos priced at under $1 million from which to choose in October, according to StreetEasy, with about a third in the vicinity of Long Island City, an area awash in construction near the East River. Although prices have climbed in the once-industrial area, the average in the third quarter was still $1.1 million, according to Elliman, down slightly from the preceding quarter. But values could soon climb, with the anticipated announcement from Amazon that it will open a major new office in the neighborhood. And many of the retailer's thousands of employees may seek housing in the area.  Among projects with numerous under-$1 million apartments is Corte, at 21-30 44th Drive, a glassy 85-unit, eight-story project from a team led by CBSK Ironstate. About a third of the units, studios and one-bedrooms fall in that category, said Kayla Lee, a saleswoman with the brokerage Modern Spaces, which is handling marketing. Unsurprisingly, pockets of value can also be found farther from Manhattan. All the apartments at Elmhurst Terrace, a 138-unit two-towered condo at 45-15 82nd Street, in Elmhurst, Queens, are priced at $1 million or below. The project, in a corner of Queens that is attracting developers, seems to be making a play for the Chinese population in nearby Flushing. Two small, local agencies focused on Chinese-speaking buyers have joined the Corcoran Group to market the 42 apartments currently for sale. Yet the building, which has mostly one- and two-bedrooms, is also drawing buyers priced out of Astoria and Long Island City, said Vivian Kuo, a Corcoran sales agent. Seven units are now in contract at the complex, which began marketing in October. And in Rockaway Park, One Sixteen, a condominium with an eight-story tower and a smattering of townhouses at 133 Beach 116th Street — near the last stop on the A train, and the ocean — is offering all but 12 of its 86 units for less than $1 million. ""There is a certain level of quality that comes along with new,"" said Mark Caller, the chief executive of the developer, the Marcal Group. ""Unless there is something unique about the dated one, new is always better, if it's the same price."" In fact, at $600 a square foot, the development's prices are far cheaper than those of most condos in Manhattan, where new developments now average $2,600 a square foot, according to the Corcoran Group. And by November, 10 buyers had signed contracts at the building, which is to open next year. Still, with 67 under-$1 million new-development listings available in October, according to StreetEasy, Manhattan is not entirely off limits to entry-level buyers. Those units are often found in Upper Manhattan, where condos are increasingly common. In Central Harlem, for instance, there is the Rennie, an eight-story, 134-unit offering at 2351 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard from BRP Companies, listed by Halstead Property Development Marketing. Sixty-eight of the 106 market-rate apartments are less listed for less than $1 million, including all of the studios and one-bedrooms, plus a small penthouse with a private terrace, said Jeff Krantz, an associate broker with Halstead. Buyers priced out of more expensive areas like Chelsea, Hell's Kitchen and TriBeCa have been sniffing around, Mr. Krantz added. Finishes at the Rennie, which was named for the Renaissance Ballroom and Casino that once stood on the site at West 138th Street, include oak floors, stainless steel appliances and Ecobee smart thermostats, and building amenities include a work lounge, gym and dog spa. The condo is also offering 27 apartments for below-market rates. But as is the case in other developments, those units will be reserved for people with incomes below certain levels and will be awarded through a lottery expected to draw thousands of applicants. Another nearby condo attracting buyers from elsewhere in Manhattan is 70 West 139th Street, a 64-unit condominium with 21 market-rate and 42 affordable apartments (plus a unit for a superintendent) from Parkadon Management and Development. Last month, a south-facing two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit with a small kitchen, a side-by-side washer and dryer, and a balcony lined with synthetic grass was listed at $995,000. ""The epicenter of value begins north of Central Park,"" said Norman Horowitz, the Halstead agent in charge of sales and, since 2005, an owner of apartment buildings in the area. The under-$1 million segment of the new-development market has been growing. In the third quarter, apartments for less than $1 million made up 16.9 percent of Manhattan's new-development market, as a share of sales, said Jonathan J. Miller, of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc., up from 11.8 percent in that quarter a year ago. At the same time, the average sale price in the ""starter market"" — the bottom 10 percent of all transactions, new and existing units, condos and co-ops — hit a record high in the third quarter of $379,000, while bidding wars were erupting over studios, he said. In fact, records have been set for the last five quarters, suggesting that even as interest in lower-priced units has increased, there still aren't enough to go around, Mr. Miller said.  ""We have been top-end oriented, but the lack of supply is becoming a very significant factor in the entry level,"" he said, noting that steep land and construction costs often make development of these units unfeasible. Buyers shouldn't expect developers to roll out more studios overnight, said Andrew Gerringer, the managing director of the Marketing Directors, a company that helps get condos off the ground. That's because slicing large apartments into smaller ones is not easy once construction has started. ""It's always easier to combine units than to take them apart,"" Mr. Gerringer said. When Michele Papa, 41, began looking to buy last winter, to upgrade from a two-bedroom rental in Sunnyside, Queens, he assumed that ""unless you spend over $1 million, it is probably very, very hard to find new construction,"" he said. But he wound up with a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo at Baldwin Park, a boutique condo in Harlem marketed by CORE Real Estate, for which he paid $945,000. The limited-frills, non-doorman building also has low common charges, about $600 a month, another plus, said Mr. Papa, who moved in last month with his wife, Patricia Cury, 33, and their infant son, Matteo. Soon after, Mr. Papa, a sound engineer, set up a recording studio in his living room, something he thinks would have been difficult to pull off in a co-op.  A less-restrictive condo — and a new one, to boot — is a delight. ""As soon as I walked in,"" he said, ""I thought, 'This is it.'""

The penalties, which grew out of President Trump's decision in May to abandon the Iran nuclear accord, take aim at Iran's oil, banking, shipping, shipbuilding and insurance sectors, and are intended to force Tehran to either abandon its foreign policy ambitions or collapse. Administration officials became almost gleeful in the run-up to Monday: There was a 12-day countdown clock on the State Department's website that resembled an advent calendar; Mr. Trump tweeted a movie-poster-style image of himself with the words ""Sanctions Are Coming"" in a nod to the popular HBO series ""Game of Thrones."" In the show, though, counterattacks are frequent, and the Trump administration is now facing its own backlash. European diplomats are quietly insisting they will complete work in the coming days or weeks on an alternative payment system with Iran that will bypass American sanctions. China, India, Russia and Iraq are likely to defy the new sanctions, too, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said this week that he would ignore them. Iran's leaders remain defiant. The challenges to the administration's Iran strategy are part of a broad pushback around the world to President Trump's aggressive and often bullying tactics, which have won him few friends and caused a steep drop in international regard for the United States. And the tough tactics have yet to prove successful almost anywhere, with threats growing in North Korea, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Administration officials have long said that their strategies had yet to fully gestate. But two years after Mr. Trump's election, that excuse no longer works. When world leaders laughed at Mr. Trump at the United Nations in September, it was an expression of growing international disdain for the president's methods, which rely almost entirely on sticks in the form of sanctions and tariffs instead of the carrots of aid, investment and dialogue. While the United States' use of sanctions has been gradually increasing for decades, Mr. Trump has made them the core of his foreign policy. From Iran to North Korea and Russia to Venezuela, from the drug dealers of Colombia to the bomb makers of Hamas, this administration's first — and sometimes only — instrument to shape world events, punish rivals and discourage challenges to American authority has been sanctions. Last year, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on a record 944 individuals and entities, according to a count provided by the law firm Gibson Dunn. This year, the number is expected to far exceed 1,000, according to Adam M. Smith, who was a top sanctions official in the Obama administration. By comparison, President Barack Obama imposed penalties on 695 individuals and entities in 2016, the previous high mark. ""Sanctions are the perfect tool for someone like President Trump, who arrived into office with no governing experience and no real relationships in Congress, the bureaucracy or among world leaders,"" Mr. Smith said. ""Sanctions let him govern on his own. He just has to write an executive order, and it's done."" Mr. Trump's fondness for sanctions illustrates a core contradiction of his foreign policy. No modern American president has been as dismissive of ""globalism"" or as vigorous in the defense of sovereignty as Mr. Trump. ""We reject the ideology of globalism,"" he said at the United Nations on Sept. 25, adding that ""responsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty not just from global governance, but also from other new forms of coercion and domination."" And yet the power of sanctions springs from the very system of international agreements that Mr. Trump rejects, and it is a device widely seen outside of the United States as an assault on sovereignty and a form of American coercion and domination. In some ways, sanctions are the perfect American weapon. They are cheap, put no American lives at risk and elicit no equivalent response. Thanks to the centrality of the dollar to the global financial system, only the United States has the power to fully wield them. Sanctions' power was demonstrated in April when penalties against the Russian aluminum producer Rusal for its connections to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and against the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE for doing business with Iran and North Korea, crippled the two global giants. The big problem, however, is that sanctions rarely work. Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, said that in his study of 100 years of sanctions efforts, 90 percent of the penalties applied for national security purposes ultimately failed. In some cases, they were disastrous: Japan's 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor was in large part a response to American oil sanctions. Iran proves the point. Tehran's regional meddling was particularly ambitious from 2012 to 2015 — just as sanctions were at their most onerous. There is a small chance that sanctions could lead to the overthrow of Iran's government, but the administration has repeatedly insisted that regime change is not its goal. Besides being largely unsuccessful, the Trump administration's unilateral use of sanctions has fueled a campaign led by Europe, Russia and China to remake the financial system, removing the United States from its heart. The consequences for America's power, economy and alliances could be profound. Even before Mr. Trump's presidency, Jack Lew, Mr. Obama's treasury secretary, warned in 2016 that overuse of sanctions could produce a dangerous reaction ""if foreign jurisdictions and companies feel that we will deploy sanctions without sufficient justification or for inappropriate reasons."" Now, with Mr. Trump's decision to walk away from the Iran nuclear accord and threaten allies who have remained in the deal, the backlash is gathering steam. European diplomats say they are determined, despite real challenges, to follow through on their promise to create a ""special-purpose vehicle"" independent of the dollar to continue commercial relations with Iran. Trump administration officials have reacted with derision and fury and have quietly threatened to sanction the entity.  Chinese and Russian officials have for years been trying to sell Europe on financial messaging and trade vehicles that skirt the dollar and the United States. So far, these efforts have had little success. That could change: ""The world has been comfortable with the dollar as the currency of reference,"" said Nicolas Véron, a French economist and senior fellow at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels. ""But that could change if doing so is seen as carrying a prize in terms of greater geopolitical independence."" Marshall Billingslea, an assistant secretary of the Treasury, said in congressional testimony that efforts to set up alternative financial systems to avoid sanctions are ""something that's a concern to us."" The Trump administration's critics worry that President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, who has said the new sanctions have isolated the United States and not Iran, may be right. They also worry that while Iran's economy will suffer in the short term, the new sanctions will spur the creation of financial mechanisms that exclude the United States, undermining American power, economic might and ability to track and contain terrorism in ways that could far outlast the Trump administration. ""It is foolishness for the United States to accelerate the development of these financial alternatives, which are a profound security threat in the long run,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg, a sanctions official during the Obama administration."
News,2018-11-10,"The Rev. Joseph Musser’s family has always lived in the region of Alsace, but not always in the same country.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/world/europe/europe-armistice-merkel-macron-peace-war.html,1585," The Rev. Joseph Musser's family has always lived in the region of Alsace, but not always in the same country. His grandfather fought for the Germans in World War I, and his father for the French in World War II. Today, no one is fighting anymore. His great-niece lives in France but works in Germany, crossing the border her ancestors died fighting over without even noticing it. It is this era of peace and borderless prosperity that champions of the European Union consider the bloc's singular achievement. ""The foundation of the European Union is the memory of war,"" said the Reverend Musser, 72. ""But that memory is fading."" On Sunday, as dozens of world leaders gather in Paris to mark the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I, the chain of memory that binds Mr. Musser's family — and all of Europe — is growing brittle. The anniversary comes amid a feeling of gloom and insecurity as the old demons of chauvinism and ethnic division are again spreading across the Continent. And as memory turns into history, one question looms large: Can we learn from history without having lived it ourselves? In the aftermath of their cataclysmic wars, Europeans banded together in shared determination to subdue the forces of nationalism and ethnic hatred with a vision of a European Union. It is no coincidence that the bloc placed part of its institutional headquarters in Alsace's capital, Strasbourg. But today, its younger generations have no memory of industrialized slaughter. Instead, their consciousness has been shaped by a decade-long financial crisis, an influx of migrants from Africa and the Middle East, and a sense that the promise of a united Europe is not delivering. To some it feels that Europe's bloody last century might as well be the Stone Age. Yet World War I killed more than 16 million soldiers and civilians, and its legacies continue to shape Europe. ''The war to end all wars'' set the scene for an even more devastating conflict and the barbarism of genocide. Winston Churchill, Britain's legendary wartime leader, thought of 1914-1945 as one long war. ""Those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it,"" he said in 1948. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose decision to welcome more than a million migrants to Germany in 2015 first became a symbol of a liberal European order, then a rallying cry for a resurgent far-right, said the jury is still out on whether Europe will heed the lessons of its past. ""We now live in a time in which the eyewitnesses of this terrible period of German history are dying,"" she said of World War II. ""In this phase, it will be decided whether we have really learned from history."" Indeed, the last World War I veteran died in 2012. And the number of those who experienced World War II and the Holocaust is rapidly shrinking, too. Politicians are apt to use history selectively when it suits them. But the history in this case is ominous. Now as then, Europe's political center is weak and the fringes are radicalizing. Nationalism, laced with ethnic hatred, has been gaining momentum. Populists sit in several European governments. World War I demolished empires and destroyed kings, kaisers and sultans. It introduced chemical weapons and aerial bombing. It brought women into the work force and hastened their legal right to vote. In Italy, a founding member of the European Union, Matteo Salvini, the nationalist deputy prime minister, has turned away migrant boats and called for the expulsion of Roma. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary speaks of a ""Muslim takeover"" and unapologetically flaunts his version of ""illiberal democracy."" ""In 1990, Europe was our future,"" he said earlier this year. ""Now, we are Europe's future."" The political discourse is deteriorating in familiar ways, too. In Germany, the far right has become the main voice of opposition in Parliament, mocking the mainstream media as ""Lügenpresse,"" or lying press — a term that was first used by the Nazis in the 1920s before their ascent to power. Traute Lafrenz, the last surviving member of the White Rose, an anti-Hitler student resistance group in the 1940s, said she got goose bumps seeing images of Hitler salutes at far-right riots in the eastern German city of Chemnitz recently. ""Maybe it's no coincidence,"" Ms. Lafrenz, now 99, told Der Spiegel. ""We are dying out and at the same time everything is coming back again."" After World War II, the European Union sought to prevent anything like it from happening again by gradually creating a common market, a common currency, a passport-free travel zone and by pooling sovereignty in a number of areas. But on Sunday, standing next to Ms. Merkel and her host, the fiercely pro-European French president, Emmanuel Macron, will be a number of nationalist leaders who would like nothing more than to pull the European Union apart — among them President Trump, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Historians guard against drawing direct parallels between the fragile aftermath of World War I and the present, pointing to a number of notable differences. Before World War I, a Europe of empires had just become a Europe of nation states; there was no tried and tested tradition of liberal democracy. Economic hardship was on another level altogether; children were dying of malnutrition in Berlin. Above all, there is not now the kind of militaristic culture that was utterly mainstream in Europe at the time. France and Germany, archenemies for centuries, are closely allied. ""What is being eroded today, is being eroded from a much higher level than anything we had ever achieved in Europe in the past,"" said Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European history at the University of Oxford. Still, Mr. Garton Ash sees 1918 as a warning that democracy and peace can never be taken for granted. ""It's a really sobering reminder that what seems like some sort of eternal order can very rapidly collapse,"" he said. In that sense, if Europe's motto after World War II was ""never again,"" the lesson of World War I is ""it could happen again."" Daniel Schönpflug, a German historian who recently published ""A World on Edge,"" an evocative book tracking 22 characters in the interwar period, points out that for centuries, periods of prolonged war in Europe's violent history have been followed by periods of prolonged peace. ""But once the generation with living memory of fighting had died, the next war came along,"" Mr. Schönpflug said. ""History teaches us that when the generation that experienced war dies out, caution diminishes and naiveté toward war increases."" ""That means we have to be very careful today,"" he said. In 1918, the artist Paul Klee made ''The Comet of Paris,'' a tightrope walker hovering precariously in the air with a comet searing through the sky above and the Eiffel Tower below. What is unnerving about the image is that one cannot discern the rope even though one knows it is there. ""It sums up where people were then, and in a way where we are today,"" said Mr. Schönpflug. No one knows what might come next. Europe has entered the unknown. In 1929, as it happened, people entered a murderous decade without even knowing. ""That's what's so eerie looking back,"" said James Hawes, a historian and author of The Shortest History of Germany. ""Right up to 1931-32, no one realized what was about to happen. They thought they were just entering another decade."" What might future historians write about the Europe of 2018? Antony Beevor, author of a numerous best-selling history books, is pessimistic. The moral dilemmas of the future will undo European liberal democracy, he predicts. The migration crisis of 2015 was only a foretaste of what is to come. ""Future waves of migration are inevitable and Europe is their main destination,"" Mr. Beevor said, pointing to the disruptive forces of poverty and climate change in developing countries as the main reasons. ""European leaders will face the choice of turning back starving refugees or of handing ammunition to the far right and eroding the fabric in their own societies,"" he said. Others see it differently. Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, says the biggest problem facing Europe is not populism but the incomplete currency union of the euro. ""The major threat of Europe at the moment is not Orban or Salvini, the major threat is that the E.U.'s institutional arrangement is unstable,"" Mr. Ferguson said. Mr. Macron's ambition has been to fix that; but there is no consensus backing him. Whatever the future of Europe's institutions, one big difference from 100 years ago is that the Continent is no longer at the heart geopolitics. ""A century ago, Europe was the center of the world — even if it was the dark tragic center of the world,"" said Dominique Moïsi, a French author and thinker. ""Today we might be back to tragedy but not to centrality."" ""History is moving elsewhere,"" he said. That, too, should be a motivation to shore up European integration, says the Reverend Musser in Alsace. One of his grandnieces is doing an internship in China, not Europe. Bones, bombs and bullets remain in the soil of Alsace, a region switched back and forth between various incarnations of France and Germany five times between the Thirty Years' War that ended in 1648 and the devastation of World War II. Local residents joke that Alsatians still keep German street signs in their basements, just in case. The Reverend Musser puts it this way: ""Alsace is a reminder of how much has been won in Europe — and how much can be lost."""

Born in 1908 (or 1911 — biographers do not agree), Petry was trained as a pharmacist, worked as a reporter, married, and would soon be a mother. Hers was not an overnight success. She paid her dues, publishing short stories and essays, sometimes writing under a male pseudonym. Her star began to rise when she was awarded a $2,500 fellowship from Houghton Mifflin to write her first novel, ""The Street,"" which sold a staggering 1.5 million copies. And did I mention that she was a black woman? So why do so few people read her work today? I really don't know. When I first encountered Petry, I was a student at Spelman College, a historically black women's college in my hometown of Atlanta. My copy of the book sported a classroom-ready cover of muted grays and the title was announced in a blockish, sober font. One of my classmates brought a vintage edition she had found at her parents' home. This cover spotlighted a woman with long hair, hourglass figure and dramatic makeup. The copy promised a tale of violence and vice. My book indicated that the story in my hands was ""a powerful, uncompromising work of social criticism"" or something snoozy like that. Could this possibly be the same book? Absolutely. ""The Street"" is my favorite type of novel, literary with an astonishing plot. The heroine, Lutie Johnson, is a single mother who lives with her 8-year-old son in Harlem. Although her marriage fell apart due to financial hardship caused by racism (and also old-fashioned incompatibility), Lutie still believes in the American Dream. Despite her attempts to be a respectable woman, Lutie's life intersects with the seedier side of Harlem. The building super becomes obsessed with her and puts her dear little boy in harm's way. Her neighbor, a Madam with a heart of gold-plate, saves Lutie from rape, but tries to push her into a relationship with a white man with underworld ties. Add to this bubbling plot an abused wife who seeks the services of a local hoodoo practitioner, a crooked lawyer, a smoky nightclub and murder-by-candlestick and you've got the kind of novel that makes 400 pages seem like too few. Even with the twisty breathless plot, Petry engages the issues of her day, which sadly are the issues of our day as well. At every turn, Lutie confronts that many-headed hydra of racism, sexism and classism. Because of its uncompromising view of injustice and its collateral effects, ""The Street"" has often been called a women's version of Richard Wright's ""Native Son."" Both novels hinge upon murders motivated by heat-of-the-moment spontaneity and deep-seated resentment born of relentless discrimination. However, it is unfair to Petry to think of her artistry as a pink-collared version of Wright. James Baldwin famously criticized Wright's hero in ""Native Son"" by noting that ""Wright imagined Bigger, but Bigger never could have imagined Wright."" Lutie Johnson most certainly could have imagined Petry and would have striven to be like her. Although ""The Street"" is sometimes praised as a ""protest novel"" and sometimes criticized for the same, ""The Street"" is a novel about people and their problems, not problems and their people. Lutie is complicated in her ambition and compassion. Lutie is a good woman, a good mother and a talented singer. But like so many women who follow the rules, a torrent of anger courses through her body, right alongside her blood. When she realizes that her big-break as a singer is really just a powerful man's scheme to force her into sex, she lets loose a lifetime of fury. ""She twisted out of his arms with a sudden, violent motion that nearly sent him off balance. The anger surging through her wasn't directed solely at him. He was there at hand; he had tricked her into staying a few extra minutes in this room with him, because she thought he was going to lend her the money she so urgently needed; and she was angry with him for that and for being a procurer for (his boss) and for assuming she would snatch at an opportunity to sleep with either or both of them. This quick surface anger helped to swell and became a part of the deepening stream of rage that had fed off the hate, the frustration, the resentment she had toward the pattern that her life had followed."" For Lutie there is no #MeToo movement. Ronan Farrow will not be calling her for a quote. Her experience more than fifty years ago is very similar to that of women today who are poor and of color. She must save herself, understanding that there will be devastating consequences for standing her ground. I recently reread ""The Street"" and I just can't figure out why this work is not more widely read and celebrated. After such a stunning reception in the 1940s, why hasn't this novel become a college staple? After all, Petry's fiction would be a godsend for professors who are looking for a book that students would actually want to read. I recall my own college days when this book was assigned. We stayed late, missing lunch because we had so much to say. And even outside the classroom, these novels would be book club gold. Maybe a better question is what can be done to ignite an Ann Petry revival? Sometimes when a writer is regarded as ""before her time"" we don't quite understand that the same work is still right on time. Petry is the writer we have been waiting for, hers are the stories we need to fully illuminate the questions of our moment, while also offering a page-turning good time. Ann Petry, the woman, had it all, and so does her insightful, prescient and unputdownable prose. Beyond 'The Street': An Ann Petry Starter Kit 'THE NARROWS' Petry's second novel continues with her penchant for marrying social commentary with complicated plot work. Both meaningful and scandalous, ""The Narrows"" is the story of a doomed interracial romance that proves that passion and prejudice are not mutually exclusive. 'TITUBA OF SALEM VILLAGE' This YA novel reminds us that Petry was a writer from New England. Tituba was the enslaved black woman who was the first person accused of practicing witchcraft in the infamous Salem Witch Trials.

Unseen. As if she had nothing to contribute to the world.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/style/intergenerational-womens-groups.html,1779," Susan Good was sitting with a group of women in her home in Palm Springs, Calif., when one of them began lamenting the difficulties of aging. But it wasn't the usual script about aches, pains and skyrocketing cholesterol levels. ""She said that she felt invisible,"" recalled Ms. Good, who is in her 70s. The speaker felt generally silenced. Unseen. As if she had nothing to contribute to the world. This shocked Ms. Good. ""Invisible"" was the last word she would have used to describe this woman. ""She was very popular with a great personality,"" she said. But then the other women in the room echoed the same feelings. ""These were all women who had college degrees, were married or had a significant other, were well traveled and led very nice lifestyles, but every one of them felt invisible,"" she said. ""They felt invisible when they saw themselves in the mirror. They didn't feel pretty any longer. Nobody was looking at them."" The word continued to haunt her, and she wondered if she could help address this prevalent feeling. So in 2015 Ms. Good, whose nickname is ""Honey,"" created a website for women 50 and over, HoneyGood.com, which offers advice on everything from pedicures to the stock market to grandparenting (she has two children, one stepchild and 26 grandchildren; a book, ""Stories for my Grandchild,"" comes out in February).  But rather than keep her initiative strictly online, Ms. Good in September started Moxie!: a free private social network on her website where women could bond. The idea was for them to share their stories, concerns and triumphs not just with people in their same age group, but across generations. IRL. At her monthly Moxie! group in Palm Springs, now in its third year, women in their 60s munch on cookies and sip coffee while mingling with women in their 80s. At a recent gathering in Chicago, where she lives half the year, guests ranged from 29 to 93. ""We talk about money issues, blended families, widowhood, invisibility,"" Ms. Good said. ""We talk about problems between mothers and daughters. The only rule I have is that nothing leaves my home."" Ms. Good's Moxie! group is one of a handful of informal, intergenerational women's gatherings that have started recently in cities around the country. Distinct from the Lean In circles started by Sheryl Sandberg, which tended to focus on career, these groups are filling a necessary void: As a January 2018 J. Walter Thompson trend report of women 53 to 72 noted, women in this age group are usually overlooked or ignored.  In most other countries, young and old freely mix together, with several generations often living under one roof. But in the United States, that mostly happens in the workplace. Even so, millennials and baby boomers tend to stick with their same-aged cohort, rarely associating out of the office. This is a limited way of socializing that cross-generational groups seek to expand. ""A lot of people think if they're mothers they can only be friends with mothers; if they're single they can only hang out with single people,"" said Shasta Nelson, 41, the author of ""Frientimacy,"" a book about deepening friendships that was published in 2016. ""But research suggests that it doesn't matter what commonality we have, only that we find a couple of commonalities. If I say, 'I'm in my 40s and I only want to meet people in my 40s,' it's as much of a predictor of friendship as saying I can only be friends with people born in September or who like Madonna or who have my name."" According to Ms. Nelson, only three things are necessary for a relationship to flourish: positivity (it has to feel good); consistency (you have to be in touch on a regular basis); and vulnerability (you have to feel safe with each other). None of them has to do with age. ""A friendship is any relationship where two people both people feel seen in a safe and satisfying way,"" she said. Ten years ago, Ms. Nelson created GirlFriend Circles, a kind of match.com for women to meet online and take it offline if they choose. She later started Travel Circles, which helps women of all ages take trips to meet other women around the world. Angela Wilkinson, 48, a self-described ""suburban housewife in Middle America"" (in this case, Marion, Iowa), went to Greece, Italy, Rwanda and Peru with Ms. Nelson. With two sons now in their early 20s, one of whom has special needs, Ms. Wilkinson said she always felt isolated at home, and unable to meet new people.  ""It's hard to make friends as an adult,"" she said. ""I didn't have friends who were older or younger."" On her trips with Ms. Nelson, she became close with two women: one of whom is 13 years older than she is, another who is 14 years younger. They have remained in touch and have even taken other vacations together. ""What helped bridge the age gap with friendship is when you're in a new situation or uncomfortable in some way — it's just a great equalizer,"" Ms. Wilkinson said. ""We're all in the same boat. On these trips everyone's on these new situations. The age goes out the window."" Though Lean In is less spoken of these days, some intergenerational women's gatherings are focused on professional advancements. Erica Keswin, 50, is a workplace strategist who started the Spaghetti Project, a monthly gathering in her Manhattan home of like-minded individuals two years ago. (The name came from a study she read Kevin Kniffin, a professor at Cornell who found that firefighters who ate meals together had higher performance levels than those who dined solo.) Some are free; others have a nominal cost. Ms. Keswin models her salons, which do include pasta, after today's average white-collar workplace, where multiple generations share one roof and are forced to interact. ""Groups of people need to come together in an intentional way,"" she said. ""It's good for us personally and in business. Regardless of where it is and who's there, good things happen when people connect."" Spaghetti Project attendees are invited not by age but by a common denominator, usually work related: They're all in the food industry, say, or obsessed with conscious capitalism, or trying to transition out of freelance writing. ""When I curate these events I want diversity of thought — race, gender, age — and not just people from the same schools or background,"" said Ms. Keswin, the author of ""Bring Your Human to Work,"" about encouraging personal authenticity in the office. ""We want people at different stages of their career."" That's also the thinking behind Generation Women, a monthly reading series in New York and Sydney, Australia, where women from multiple generations read short stories and essays loosely centered around a theme. The series came about after a conversation its founder, the novelist Georgia Clark, 38, had with her mother about ""disappearing"" in later life. ""She said that as she had gotten older people looked right through her,"" Ms. Clark said. ""If we're walking down the street together they'll just look at me, and if she's alone it's as if she's not there."" ""I was aware of ageism as an issue, but because it was something my mother said it really made it personal and I got mad,"" she continued. ""I wanted to do something about it. I wanted to create a storytelling event where women of all ages could come together and feel comfortable and heard. We make a lot of space in our society for teens through 30s, for their experiences and journeys and point of views, but we don't make space for women in their 60s, 70s and 80s, who are still going through changes and evolution and whose perspectives are so much greater."" Some participants find these sorts of intergenerational gatherings comforting in a divisive political climate. Younger women are seeking solace in the assurance of older women, who have lived through political uncertainty or wartime, that everything will be O.K. Older women appreciate the passion and drive of younger women in case everything isn't. ""I'm blown away by their emotional sills and self-awareness,"" said Christine Mulvey, 60, a writer in Nevada City, Calif., who attends annual Honey Root Embodiment Gathering intergenerational retreats (no relation to Honey Good). ""Things I came to in my 40s and 50s, young women are coming to so much earlier. I find permission to be themselves and to be creative in them that just thrills me. I'm delighted by it. Their hunger for real connection and depth, their passion for the world."" ""And then there's a darker side to that,"" Ms. Mulvey said. ""The passion that I see in them can slip into a kind of despair. There's something about being older and having been through a number of cycles from different eras that kind of holds the despair at bay, and also calls it into a sense of how important it is that they show up and engage."" At HoneyRoot's Embodiment Gathering (yes, the name is a little woo-wooey, but it is California, after all), which lasts four days and costs $495 to $750, depending on financial means, certain women are given ""elder"" status, which means they're treated as valued members whose experiences are honored and respected. They, in turn, welcome the ""youngers"" into adulthood. (Each woman determines for herself when she's an ""elder"" — for most woman it's when they are postmenopausal.) ""I think our younger members have an understanding that strangely not everyone does, that one day they will be older women and that we're all responsible for creating a society that honors older women,"" said Devorah Bry, 40, the founder of HoneyRoot, who is a dancer and couple's therapist in Nevada City, Calif.  ""The dominant culture tells you that when you get to a certain age you can't be included anymore,"" Ms. Bry said. ""It's cool to see certain people who say, 'I don't want you to see my age, I want you to see my age and spirit.' Then other people who are in the same room who want you to acknowledge that 'I'm older and living in a different type of body now, I want to be honored that I have life experience now.' It's really about paying attention. We're all going to get to the end of our life."" Jessica Arnold, 30, started going to HoneyRoot two years ago. She was feeling adrift, and worried about the country.  ""I really felt I needed more connection with older people, especially politically — I feel really lost,"" Ms. Arnold said. ""But I also have this sense that history repeats itself and that it's a continuum that has happened throughout history. I need the guidance and remembrance that times like these have happened before and to keep your eyes set on something greater."""
News,2018-11-10,"PARIS — They shook hands politely and patted each other on the arm stiffly. Their tight-lipped smiles appeared strained and forced. No cheeks were kissed, no friendly rubs were given, none of the bonhomie of their earlier meetings was on display.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/world/europe/world-war-i-trump-macron.html,1559," PARIS — They shook hands politely and patted each other on the arm stiffly. Their tight-lipped smiles appeared strained and forced. No cheeks were kissed, no friendly rubs were given, none of the bonhomie of their earlier meetings was on display. So much for the bromance. After a promising start, the relationship between President Trump and President Emmanuel Macron of France has soured. By the time they met in Paris on Saturday, the trans-Atlantic alliance that was to be showcased by this weekend's commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I appeared to be fraying instead. ""The honeymoon is well and truly over,"" said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""Trump's visible contempt for allies over trade and the Iran nuclear deal are humiliating for Macron. There were high hopes of Macron's charm offensive, but Trump's actions have shown that it had no policy impact and that it is dangerous for any political leader to tie his reputation to the mercurial mood swings of the American president."" It did not help on Saturday that Mr. Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery at the foot of the hill where the Battle of Belleau Wood was fought. Aides cited the rain; the Marines who pilot presidential helicopters often recommend against flying in bad weather. But that did not convince many in Europe who saw it as an excuse and another sign of disrespect. ""They died with their face to the foe and that pathetic inadequate @realDonaldTrump couldn't even defy the weather to pay his respects to The Fallen,"" Nicholas Soames, a Conservative member of the British Parliament and grandson of Winston Churchill, wrote on Twitter. He added the hashtag: #hesnotfittorepresenthisgreatcountry. Ben Rhodes, who was deputy national security adviser to President Barack Obama, dismissed the explanation. ""I helped plan all of President Obama's trips for 8 years,"" he tweeted. ""There is always a rain option. Always."" Mr. Trump will have another chance to pay respects to the war dead on Sunday with a scheduled visit to the Suresnes American Cemetery outside Paris following the ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe marking the anniversary of the armistice at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. But he will not stay for a Paris peace forum that Mr. Macron is sponsoring to bring together world leaders to discuss ways to avoid conflict. ""Trump's absence from the Peace forum tomorrow, apparently alone among the 72 heads of state and government, will have a negative impact — the man who did not even pretend to work for peace, as it were,"" said François Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a research organization. In a five-minute session with reporters before their meeting on Saturday, Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron sought to defuse simmering tension over security and trade. Mr. Macron reassured his visitor that his proposal to create a ""true European army"" was in harmony with Mr. Trump's repeated insistence that Europe stop relying so much on the United States for its defense. World War I demolished empires and destroyed kings, kaisers and sultans. It introduced chemical weapons and aerial bombing. It brought women into the work force and hastened their legal right to vote. ""I do share President Trump's views that we need much better burden-sharing within NATO, and that's why I do believe my proposals for European defense are utterly consistent with that,"" Mr. Macron said with Mr. Trump at the Élysée Palace. Mr. Trump, who had called the idea of a European army ""very insulting"" in a tweet three minutes after Air Force One landed in France on Friday, said he was glad to hear Mr. Macron's reasoning. ""He understands the United States can only do so much, in fairness to the United States,"" Mr. Trump said. The flap may have resulted from misleading accounts of Mr. Macron's comments, which came in an interview in French with Europe 1 radio this week. In the interview, Mr. Macron said that Europe needed to defend itself against the United States as well as Russia and China, but he was referring to cyberthreats, not the American government. The discussion of a European army actually came up later in the interview, and he characterized it as lightening America's burden, not defending against it. Still, Mr. Macron was critical in the interview of Mr. Trump's move to scrap the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, a three-decade-old agreement that eliminated a whole class of missiles stationed in and aimed at Europe. The United States has accused Russia of violating the treaty and Mr. Trump seems focused on whether such missiles might be useful in countering China, but European leaders see it as reopening a threat to their own countries. ""When I see President Trump announcing that he's quitting a major disarmament treaty, which was formed after the 1980s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim?"" Mr. Macron said in the interview. ""Europe and its security."" The tense meeting with Mr. Trump contrasted with Mr. Macron's joint appearance with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany later in the day. At a solemn ceremony in the woods outside the northern town of Compiègne where the armistice was signed on Nov. 11, 1918, the two leaders stood in front of a plaque celebrating peace and Franco-German friendship. It was the first time a German leader had returned to the spot where both World War I and World War II armistices were concluded. After conquering France in 1940, Adolf Hitler forced the defeated French to return the same railway car used in 1918 to consecrate Germany's defeat, a way of humiliating his vanquished foe. On Saturday, Mr. Macron and Ms. Merkel entered a similar car that now sits inside a museum at the site and sat glumly side by side for a few moments. The original car was destroyed during the second war and much at the site razed on Hitler's orders. The ceremony, simple yet symbolic, was over in 45 minutes, after the French and German national anthems were sung. ""The symbolism of it is, it's not just a question of military victory, or military defeat, but of friendship between France and Germany, and also that both sides have overcome this defeat,"" said Sylvain Fort, a top aide to Mr. Macron. ""We've overcome this defeat to build a friendship that's lasted 70 years."" The meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Macron earlier in the day seemed decidedly chillier than their warm session in Washington in April when they smiled broadly, hugged, kissed each other on the cheeks and lavished praise on each other. During their short appearance before reporters, Mr. Trump remained formal and distant. When he avoided sharp language in front of the cameras, Mr. Macron appeared relieved and patted Mr. Trump's leg appreciatively. ""We have become very good friends over the last couple of years,"" Mr. Trump said, with none of the enthusiasm of last spring. ""We have much in common in many ways — perhaps more ways than people would understand. But we are — we're very much similar in our views."" Mr. Macron referred to Mr. Trump as ""my good friend"" and said they had ""worked very closely together"" in countering Syria's use of chemical weapons. ""Our people are very proud to have you here,'' he said. A major point of contention is Mr. Trump's decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran following his withdrawal from the multinational accord intended to curb the country's nuclear program. The French want to continue doing business with Iran and resent pressure by the Americans. The Trump administration  waived the sanctions for eight countries, but France was not among them. One of Mr. Macron's senior advisers complained about bullying by Washington earlier this week. ""Europe refuses to allow the U.S. to be the trade policeman of the world,"" Bruno Le Maire, the economy minister, told The Financial Times. The two sides remain at odds over broader trade issues as well. Mr. Trump has slapped steel and aluminum tariffs on Europe and other trading partners, and has threatened tariffs on cars manufactured in Europe. Mr. Trump said negotiations to ease the tariff war have been promising. ""We've made a lot of progress,"" he said. ""We'll see if we can get it over the line, as they say."" Mr. Trump remains deeply unpopular in Europe, especially in France, where just 9 percent think he will do the right thing in international relations, according to the Pew Research Center. The president's seeming indifference to European sensibilities was reinforced by a report in Le Monde, the French newspaper, that in a meeting with the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania earlier this year, Mr. Trump confused the Baltic states for Balkan states and blamed them for the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Mr. Macron understands the importance of maintaining the relationship, said Karen Donfried, president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. But ""domestically,"" she said, ""it may be better for him if the bromance has cooled visibly."" Charles A. Kupchan, a former Europe adviser to Mr. Obama, said that Europe has all but given up on Mr. Trump and is focused instead on developing its own ""strategic autonomy"" to make it less dependent on the United States. ""Trump might be able to retain decent working relationships with populist governments in Italy, Poland, and Hungary,"" he said. ""But the rest of Europe is resigned to running out the clock, hoping and praying that Trump is a one-term president."""
News,2018-11-10,"DES MOINES — Partway through his stump speech at the Iowa State Fair in August, Representative John Delaney spotted a familiar face walking by.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/politics/john-delaney-2020-iowa.html,1360," DES MOINES — Partway through his stump speech at the Iowa State Fair in August, Representative John Delaney spotted a familiar face walking by. ""Mr. Speaker!"" he called from his perch atop The Des Moines Register's soapbox. ""What a nice surprise. Speaker Boehner is in the house. You're looking good, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate you coming out and supporting me, I really do."" John Boehner, the former House speaker, wearing a blue-and-white gingham shirt almost identical to Mr. Delaney's — and looking distinctly as though he wished he had taken a different route from the pork chop stand to the parking lot — was instantly surrounded by reporters. ""I worked on a lot of stuff with him. He's a good member,"" was about all Mr. Boehner, a Republican, would say of Mr. Delaney, a Maryland Democrat running for president. ""Oh God. I'm just walking by. If it weren't Delaney there — I'm walking by, I got a pork chop, I was walking by, I saw Delaney. I said, 'Aw, I'll stop.' I should have known better. I should have kept walking."" It was hardly a reaffirming moment for Mr. Delaney, but he will take any recognition he can get. Political junkies like to joke that the 2020 campaign began the moment the polls closed on Tuesday, but Mr. Delaney is already more than a year into his.  He is well aware that better-known Democratic politicians like Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are attracting more news coverage even though they have not yet officially declared, and he knows that even though he is the only major candidate running right now, he is running from behind.  So why do it? ""I think I'm the right person for the job, but not enough people knew who I was or still know who I am,"" Mr. Delaney, 55, said. ""The way to solve that problem, it seems to me, is to get in early and just work harder than everyone else."" While Mr. Boehner's clear discomfort showed how little he had expected to run into a campaign-trail press scrum more than two years before the 2020 election, Mr. Delaney seemed to thoroughly enjoy the pageantry in Iowa, whose caucuses are the first test for presidential candidates at the ballot box. He strolled over to WHO-HD's corn poll and dropped a kernel in a jar for Fred Hubbell, the Democratic candidate for governor, who would lose three months later. He grabbed a rug and went on the Giant Slide with the youngest of his four daughters, Grace, 11, who looked unconvinced of the wisdom of this activity.  That night, he would cheerfully recall the Boehner encounter in a speech at the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding.  And two days later, he would hit the last of Iowa's 99 counties, completing a classic campaign feat before any better-known opponent started. He isn't running for re-election to the House, the better to go ""all in"" on running for president. It's hard to overstate how unusual Mr. Delaney's timeline is. He announced his candidacy on July 28, 2017, almost three years before the Democratic convention. John T. Woolley, co-director of the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said that with the arguable exception of President Trump, whose campaign apparatus never disbanded after 2016, he didn't know of ""any case of a serious major-party candidate announcing so far before the election.""  Characteristically for a man who spent much of his career in finance — and who listened to one Iowan describe how the cost of his medication had skyrocketed and proceeded to calculate the ""annual compounded increase"" in his head — Mr. Delaney likened his campaign start date to inflation-adjusted dollars. ""Campaigns have gotten much longer,"" he said. ""When Jimmy Carter announced, which was effectively right after the midterms — back then, on a relative pace, this was similar to what I'm doing now."" Mr. Carter was the quintessential ""came out of nowhere"" candidate, something Mr. Delaney hopes to duplicate. But the retail politicking that lifted Mr. Carter in 1976 is not as decisive as it once was. Around this time in 2015, the five Republicans who had visited Iowa the most were all polling in the bottom half of the pack. Two days after the caucuses in 2016, not one was still in the race. And yet, by some measures, Mr. Delaney's strategy has been effective. In an Emerson College poll in September, only 21 percent of Iowa voters were unfamiliar with him. At the Iowa State Fair, one couple — Connie Waller, 74, and Don Waller, 75, farmers in nearby Van Meter — even recognized him from his TV ads.  ""He's just coming out and saying, 'Here's who I am and here's what I believe in,'"" Ms. Waller said approvingly. ""I like him right now. But there's not a lot of others."" Mr. Delaney's central message is simple: Globalization has been an ""extraordinarily positive"" force, he says, but not for everyone, and politicians should have acted — through tax incentives, infrastructure investments, better public education, universal health care — to make it positive for more people. Instead, they were ""too busy fighting."" In an interview on his campaign bus, winding through corn and soybean fields west of Des Moines, he said he would start to change that by dedicating the first 100 days of his administration exclusively to existing bipartisan legislation. He cited a criminal justice overhaul drafted by Mr. Booker and Rand Paul; immigration reform as proposed in a bill that passed the Senate with a supermajority in 2013, but that Mr. Boehner refused to bring to the House floor; and repairs to the Affordable Care Act outlined by Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray.  ""So much of politics these days has become, quote, 'about politics,'"" Mr. Delaney said in an earlier interview, adding that he wanted to emphasize civility, bipartisanship and compromise. ""People getting into these pointless arguments about ideology, and are you left or center or progressive, or all this garbage."" A self-described ""pragmatic idealist,"" Mr. Delaney was a businessman before he was elected to the House in 2012: the founder of two financial companies and, at one point, the youngest chief executive on the New York Stock Exchange. Those companies made him one of the wealthiest members of Congress, with an estimated net worth of more than $90 million — allowing him now to finance most of his campaign while, by his own acknowledgment, not yet focusing on fund-raising. At the end of the last quarter, he had raised about $1 million and contributed $2.5 million of his own money. But on the trail, he emphasizes his working-class roots. Neither of his parents went to college. His father, an electrician, belonged to a union that covered half of Mr. Delaney's tuition at Columbia, ""which has always been a great reminder for me that none of us do it alone in life,"" he said to a crowd in Adel. ""I would have nothing that I have today but for a bunch of electricians reaching into their pockets."" Mr. Delaney's strategy is classic small-town retail politics. Over five days in August — his 14th trip to Iowa — he covered more than 700 miles and held more than two dozen events, many of them featuring fewer than 20 people in cities with populations of barely more than 1,000.  At a cafe in Greenfield (population 1,800), he met with the Adair County Optimist Club. In Panora (population 1,100), he campaigned for a House candidate, Cindy Axne, and the Democratic nominee for Iowa's secretary of agriculture, Tim Gannon.  In Grundy Center (population 2,700), he canvassed with Dennis Evans, a candidate for the Iowa House. In Atlantic (population 6,700), he visited the farm of another Iowa House candidate, Denise O'Brien, and asked her about agriculture policy.  Less than five hours later, he added one of Ms. O'Brien's policy suggestions — making the national farm bill last longer than five years — to his stump speech.  At the Greenfield event in particular, Mr. Delaney received a warm welcome. Afterward, Marcia Fulton, 77, of Creston, declared herself ""extremely impressed."" But she also said she was ""anxious to see who else comes into"" the race. The caucuses, after all, were still more than 500 days away."
News,2018-11-10,"PHOENIX — At first, the Republican looked as if she could win Arizona’s Senate race by a razor-thin margin. Then the Green Party emerged as a potential spoiler, even though its candidate had dropped out of the race. Now the Democrat has taken the lead.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/us/arizona-senate-sinema-mcsally-green-party.html,1035," PHOENIX — At first, the Republican looked as if she could win Arizona's Senate race by a razor-thin margin. Then the Green Party emerged as a potential spoiler, even though its candidate had dropped out of the race. Now the Democrat has taken the lead. Confused yet? The battle for the seat being vacated by Senator Jeff Flake, the Republican ridiculed time and again by President Trump, is just getting started. Arizona's election officials say it could take days for a winner to emerge as they steadily count hundreds of thousands of ballots after a surge in turnout around the state. Mr. Trump is weighing in, claiming without offering proof that corruption is tainting the race. The chairman of the Arizona Republican Party is accusing the top election official in Phoenix of voter fraud, prompting angry rebuttals from Democrats who seem to be clawing back in a Republican bastion. ""Welcome to the new Arizona,"" said Joseph Garcia, the director of the Latino Public Policy Center at Arizona State University. ""We're slowly shifting from a red conservative state to a blue progressive state. Will this process be smooth at every turn? No way."" In a state that is home to conservative icons like Joe Arpaio and Jan Brewer, the power struggle is revealing one potential path forward for Democrats fighting to win elections in a state where they haven't won an open Senate seat since 1976: embrace the center. [Here's a look at how close the results are in Arizona, Georgia and Florida.] Kyrsten Sinema, 42, the Democrat in the race, started out as a liberal but moved hard to the middle after winning a seat in the House of Representatives in 2012. She drew attention for staking out relatively conservative positions on various issues, sometimes siding with Mr. Trump and other Republicans. Some liberal Democrats were left aghast by such positioning, but it seems to be working for Ms. Sinema, who is currently ahead of her rival by about 29,800 votes. About 150,000 voters who cast ballots for Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican who sailed to re-election this week, also voted for Ms. Sinema, tallies show, suggesting that her strategy of appealing to moderate Republicans and independent voters may be working. At the same time, her Republican opponent, Martha McSally, 52, a congresswoman and former United States Air Force pilot, drifted away during the campaign from centrist positions to a more energetic embrace of Mr. Trump on issues like building a wall on the border with Mexico. Arizona is just one state where voting has been marked by confusion, rancor and undecided races in the aftermath of the midterm elections. Races in Florida and Georgia also remain extremely close. In Arizona, election officials emphasized the need to count mail-in ballots, early ballots dropped off on Election Day and provisional ballots. Turnout was unusually robust in the state, with some estimates reaching as high as 65 percent, the highest level in decades. Republican officials filed a lawsuit against Adrian Fontes, a Democrat and the top election official in Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, over the way that signatures on ballots are verified. But a settlement was quickly reached requiring all counties in the state to continue checking signatures until Nov. 14. In a state where Republicans have exerted near hegemonic control in some levels, Ms. Sinema's strategy of appealing to voters on both sides of the fence comes with obvious risks. For instance, in the closing days of the race, the Republican Party sent out mailers to some Democratic voters in the state. The leaflets didn't mention the Republican or Democrat in the race but the Green Party candidate, Angela Green, and her support for policies like legalizing marijuana and robustly expanding public health care. ""It was a classic reverse psychology tactic,"" said Tyler Montague, a Republican campaign strategist in Arizona, emphasizing how the mailers may have had the effect of peeling away liberal support for Ms. Sinema, while bolstering Ms. Green. Never mind that Ms. Green dropped out of the race and endorsed Ms. Sinema. Ms. Green, 48, who works in the mortgage industry and is an avowed progressive, still received about 47,000 votes — far more than the 29,800-vote lead currently held by Ms. Sinema over Ms. McSally. The small Green Party's role in the race has elicited recriminations from Democrats over the possibility that their candidate could end up losing to a Republican closely aligned with President Trump if the final vote count shifts in Ms. McSally's favor. We're tracking the votes as they are tallied in two races for governor and two for Senate that have slim margins. ""That underestimates the intelligence of the tens of thousands of people who voted for me,"" said Ms. Green. ""Obviously there are a lot of people out there who are very frustrated with both sides."" In a state where registered Republicans still easily outnumber Democrats, promoting Green Party candidates is nothing new. In 2010, a Republican political operative went so far as to recruit drifters and homeless people onto the Green Party ballot in an effort to siphon some support from Democrats. And in a twist involving some irony, Ms. Sinema got her start in politics as an activist and spokeswoman for the Green Party in Arizona. She then joined the Democratic Party, won a seat in the State Legislature and went on to be elected in 2012 to the U.S. House of Representatives. The confusion surrounding the race is eliciting different reactions from voters. ""I'm glad they're taking the time to do it right,"" said Brenda Palmer, 57, a financial reporting manager with the Arizona State Retirement System. Ms. Palmer said she voted in the past for both Republicans and Democrats but opted for the first time in this election to vote a straight Democratic ticket. ""Sometimes they come back so quickly I wonder how accurate can it be,"" Ms. Palmer added, referring to the way election results are released in Arizona. Others were already expressing fatigue with an often venomous race in which Democrats and Republicans spent heavily on attack ads. ""I didn't care for either of them because of the way they went after one another,"" said Roger Quaing, 72, a retired manager of auto parts warehouses. Still, he voted for the Republican in the race. ""I felt McSally was the lesser of two evils."""
News,2018-11-10,"HONG KONG — An exiled Chinese novelist spoke at a literary festival in Hong Kong on Saturday, two days after his appearance had been briefly canceled in a move that was widely seen as the latest erosion of freedoms in the semiautonomous city.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/world/asia/ma-jian-hong-kong-literary-festival.html,901," HONG KONG — An exiled Chinese novelist spoke at a literary festival in Hong Kong on Saturday, two days after his appearance had been briefly canceled in a move that was widely seen as the latest erosion of freedoms in the semiautonomous city. The writer, Ma Jian, whose appearances at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival were reinstated at the last minute, said the reversal ""proves the failure"" of self-censorship. Mr. Ma, a British citizen who lives in exile in London, said on Saturday that a robust literary culture helps to ""safeguard the bottom line of our civilization."" ""Of course there is no way literature can resist a political force,"" he told reporters at a hastily arranged news conference. But he said that ""in fiction we find our real roots: the goodness of human nature."" There had been concern that Mr. Ma might be taking a security risk by even traveling to Hong Kong, where a few booksellers who published titles critical of China's Communist government have disappeared in recent years, only to turn up in custody on the Chinese mainland. Mr. Ma's appearances at the Tai Kwun Center for Heritage and Arts were thrown into doubt on Thursday when the venue said it would not host them. Mr. Ma's books have been banned in mainland China since 1987, and he says his new novel, the biting satire ""China Dream,"" is a political allegory of the country's modern self. ""We do not want Tai Kwun to become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual,"" Timothy Calnin, the center's director, said in a statement on Thursday. ""We have therefore worked closely with the Hong Kong International Literary Festival to find a more suitable alternative venue."" Tai Kwun reversed course on Friday, saying it had ""reconsidered our position in light of the possibility that these events might be prevented from taking place altogether."" Yet it was unclear on Friday whether Mr. Ma, who previously lived in Hong Kong and has permanent resident status here, would even be allowed to enter the city when his flight landed that evening. He later said on Twitter that he would be speaking at the festival as a novelist, ""which is my only identity,"" and that he was not a politician. ""But anyone who has ever read me knows that my books are deeply political, and China Dream is no exception,"" he added. ""All literature is political, whether the writer intends it to be or not."" Phillipa Milne, the festival's director, told reporters on Saturday that its goal was to promote Hong Kong's literary arts while also ""supporting the principles of free speech by providing a platform for a diverse spectrum of inspirational local and international writers."" She did not take questions. The festival came amid growing concerns about Hong Kong's future as a haven for rule of law and civil rights in Asia. Last week, for example, the political cartoonist Badiucao, whose works satirize leaders of mainland China and Hong Kong, called off a solo exhibition in Hong Kong after receiving threats from the Chinese authorities. On Thursday, the Hong Kong authorities denied entry as a visitor to Victor Mallet, an editor at The Financial Times, a few weeks after he was expelled from the city. Mr. Mallet's expulsion was widely seen as retaliation for his role in hosting a talk with a local independence advocate at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong in August. On Saturday, Mr. Ma declined to directly answer a question about whether he felt safe in Hong Kong, but he noted that he had informed the British authorities of his travel plans. ""I know if I ever disappear, they will look for me,"" he added. Emily Lau, a former Democratic Party member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, said the back-and-forth over Mr. Ma's appearances created an emotional ""roller coaster"" for many people in the city. Ms. Lau said she believed the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which finances and operates the Tai Kwun center, had faced political pressure to cancel Mr. Ma's visit, and that the reversal of the cancellation was not much of a victory because it had already set a damaging precedent. ""In Hong Kong we've never had democracy, but we enjoy freedoms,"" she said. ""Now it seems our freedoms are being taken away."" A spokeswoman for the Jockey Club did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday evening. Mr. Ma, 65, has been barred from entering mainland China since 2011, and he spoke at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival as recently as 2013. He was back this year to speak at a panel discussion on Hong Kong literature and to promote ""China Dream,"" whose title refers to the signature catchphrase of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The book, published in Britain this month, charts the disintegration of a Chinese official who is haunted by his violent past. On Saturday evening, Mr. Ma told a packed auditorium that the totalitarian society that George Orwell had described in his dystopian novel ""1984"" had now been ""completely and totally"" realized in China. He also said he saw repression and propaganda in the Chinese mainland today that was eerily similar to that of the Cultural Revolution. He said he feared that building the ""China dream"" that Mr. Xi envisions would require erasing China's recent history. ""If we ignore history, what follows will be something even more horrible,"" he said."
News,2018-11-10,"ROME — Rome’s embattled mayor was acquitted on Saturday of charges of lying about a city hall appointment, a case that threatened her career as well as the credibility of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement she represents.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/world/europe/virginia-raggi-rome-mayor-italy.html,469," ROME — Rome's embattled mayor was acquitted on Saturday of charges of lying about a city hall appointment, a case that threatened her career as well as the credibility of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement she represents. A judge found that no crime had been committed when the mayor, Virginia Raggi, appointed the brother of her top aide to a prestigious tourism position at the beginning of her tenure in 2016. ""This sentence wipes away two years of political mud,"" Ms. Raggi told reporters outside Rome's court. ""I am going ahead with our heads high for Rome, my beloved city, and all residents."" Prosecutors had sought a 10-month prison term on charges that Ms. Raggi had lied to anti-corruption officials when they questioned her about the appointment. Ms. Raggi said that the choice was hers alone, while prosecutors argued that it had been orchestrated by her aide. Had Ms. Raggi been convicted, she would have faced the loss of her position as mayor. Under the Five Star Movement's rules, no member convicted of a crime may stay in office, even pending appeal. The verdict was saluted as a victory by Luigi Di Maio, Italy's vice prime minister and the political leader of the Five Star Movement, which governs in an increasingly tense coalition with the anti-immigrant League of Matteo Salvini. ""Happy to always have defended you, and always believed in you,"" Mr. Di Maio wrote in a blog post on the Movement's website. ""The real plague of this country is the vast majority of intellectually and morally corrupt media,"" Mr. Di Maio added. Such journalists were trying to topple the government, he said, with the specific strategy of ""glorifying the League and always butchering the Movement."" The comment betrayed Five Star's difficulty in keeping up with its increasing popular coalition partner. A recent survey showed that Five Star is losing support even as it is rising for the League and Mr. Salvini, the deputy prime minister and interior minister. Mr. Salvini's tough immigration policies and his image of Italy's strongman are appealing to Italian voters: 30 percent would now vote for the League. Political observers noted that, if Ms. Raggi had been made to quit, Mr. Salvini might have tried to take the high-profile position of running Italy's capital for his own party. Regardless of the criminal case against her, Ms. Raggi is under constant pressure over a sense of decay in the city, where basic services like garbage collection are spotty in many neighborhoods and the transportation company is on the constant verge of financial collapse. In the past six months, a bus caught fire in the city center and a metro escalator packed with Russian soccer fans collapsed, wounding dozens. This weekend, Romans vote in a nonbinding referendum on whether they want the city's transportation services to be privatized."

We'll keep it concise, informative and hopefully entertaining — because we know your time is precious, especially on the weekend. So have a read, tell us what you think, forward to a friend and then get back to your other Sunday standbys — perhaps you'll attempt one of these mesmerizing pies, gawk at Central Park's handsome celebrity duck or peruse Oprah's new ""Favorite Things."" After all, don't we all deserve a ""snuggle lounger"" — whatever that is? Nov. 4–10 The most expensive midterm elections are behind us. So what now, besides a stock market that breathed a sigh of relief? With Democrats in control of the House, the Republicans' promise of future tax cuts look dicey, unless they can compromise by raising corporate taxes to pay for lower rates for the middle class. (President Trump said he'd consider it.) But don't expect much else in the way of bipartisanship. Now that Representative Maxine Waters of California is primed to lead a more hawkish House Financial Services Committee, buckle up for investigations into the President's real estate and financial dealings, starting with his dealings with Deutsche Bank.  Facebook claims to have won its latest battle against fake news. Its ""war room"" of employees working around the clock to fight false news stories collaborated with the F.B.I. last week to thwart a Kremlin-backed group of trolls that had meddled in the 2016 election. As a result, Facebook says, the midterms were relatively free of smear campaigns from foreign entities, at least on its platforms. But are Facebook's efforts sustainable — and are they enough? The network also released an independent report on its role in deadly hate crimes in Myanmar, and admitted that it ""can and should do more"" to prevent ""being used to foment division and incite offline violence."" After a yearlong (and much-publicized) quest to find a home for ""HQ2,"" Amazon may split its second headquarters between two new locations. The two are expected to be New York City — namely, the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens — as well as Crystal City in Arlington, Va. (In other offline news, an Amazon toy catalog — in print! — is scheduled to thump on your doorstep this month.) Meanwhile, Google is quietly buttoning up a deal to grow its Manhattan footprint, potentially adding space for more than 12,000 additional workers. The company also announced an overhaul of its sexual misconduct policy. Nov. 11–17 On Monday, economic leaders from 21 nations will gather for the weeklong Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Papua New Guinea. China will have a flashy presence, literally, as it has given tens of millions of dollars for a swish renovation of the summit's convention center, as well as the country's main highway. Mr. Trump, who made his ""America first"" stance clear at last year's APEC meeting, will not attend; instead, he's sending Vice President Mike Pence. Which is just as well, perhaps, since the convention's hottest topics will include trade and climate change, and the president's views on these issues are not winning the United States many friends these days. On Thursday and Friday, the United States International Trade Commission will hold a hearing on the likely impact of his United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on the economy and American consumers. This replacement of Nafta needs congressional approval to pass, which may be tricky now that the Democrats are about to have a majority in the House. The agreement focuses mainly on new rules for exporting cars, dairy products, wine and pharmaceutical drugs, but critics worry that some provisions will backfire. Auto production is one concern: If the deal makes this more expensive, it could raise prices for American car buyers and give incentives to manufacturers to move production elsewhere. The sale of David Hockney's 1972 painting, ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures),"" is estimated to fetch $80 million at a Christie's auction this Thursday. If the bidding does go this high, the piece will become the most expensive work sold by a living artist, a record held by Jeff Koons' ""Balloon Dog"" since 2013, when it sold for $58.4 million. Hockney not your taste? Edward Hopper's ""Chop Suey"" will be at Christie's too, expected to sell for $70 million to $100 million. The China trade war has trickled down to the lobster market, leaving Mainers high and dry with millions of pounds of unsold crustaceans. And speaking of weird-looking animals: The oldest known figure drawing — found in a cave in Borneo — depicts a reddish creature with spindly legs. Finally, Bill Gates is giving millions of dollars to teams trying to invent a better, more sanitary toilet for the good of humankind — and held up a jar of poop to announce it. The man knows how to make a point. What Counts 7.3 inches: The full width of Samsung's new foldable-screen smartphone, which opens like a book to reveal a screen the size of a tablet.

Obituary (Obit),2018-11-11,"Ron Johnson, the All-Pro running back who became the first player in Giants history to gain at least 1,000 rushing yards in a season, achieving the milestone twice in the 1970s, died on Saturday at an assisted living facility in Madison, N.J. He was 71.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/10/obituaries/ron-johnson-dead-giants.html,846," Ron Johnson, the All-Pro running back who became the first player in Giants history to gain at least 1,000 rushing yards in a season, achieving the milestone twice in the 1970s, died on Saturday at an assisted living facility in Madison, N.J. He was 71. His wife, Karen, confirmed the death. Johnson was found to have Alzheimer's disease in 2008. The Giants had only two winning seasons between 1964 and 1980. Both came when Johnson achieved rushing milestones for the franchise. ""When I got to New York, the running backs were Tucker Frederickson and Ernie Koy,"" he recalled in Ken Palmer's ""Game of My Life: Memorable Stories of Giants Football"" (2007). ""They were two white, big fullback-type guys. Everyone assumed that if you were black, you were fast. The Giants never really had anybody like that. So I was very, very well received when I got to New York."" Johnson, 6 feet 1 inches and 205 pounds in his playing days, ran for 1,027 yards and eight touchdowns in 1970, his first season as a Giant. He also had 487 receiving yards, giving him a league-leading 1,514 yards from scrimmage. The Giants went 9-5. and he was voted to the All-Pro first team and the Pro Bowl. ""He's the best halfback in football today — period,"" the Giants' star quarterback Fran Tarkenton told The Associated Press after Johnson caught a touchdown pass, ran for another score and rushed for more than 130 yards in a 23-20 comeback victory over the Dallas Cowboys in November 1970. ""He catches the ball, he blocks, he runs inside and outside, he makes the big plays,"" Tarkenton said. After missing most of the 1971 season with an injury, Johnson ran for 1,182 yards and nine touchdowns in 1972, when he was again chosen for the Pro Bowl. He set a Giants record for touchdowns in a game when he scored three times on passes from Tarkenton's successor, Norm Snead, and once on a run in a victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in October 1972. The Giants went 8-6 that season, then reverted to their losing ways. Johnson was an All-American halfback at Michigan, and he was the first black player to be named a football captain there. He scored 19 rushing touchdowns in the 1968 season, including a five-touchdown, 347-yard game against Wisconsin; all are still university records. As a rookie with the Cleveland Browns, who selected him in the first round of the 1969 draft, he scored seven touchdowns. The Browns traded him to the Giants in 1970 for receiver Homer Jones in a multiplayer deal. For all his achievements in six seasons with the Giants, Johnson was hampered by injuries, and the team did not win so much as a division title. ""I'd like to go anywhere to play for a winner,"" he told The Sarasota Herald Tribune in January 1975. The Giants did not trade him, and he retired following the 1975 season. Ronald Adolphus Johnson, the youngest of five children, was born on Oct. 17, 1947, in Detroit, where his father, Arthur, owned a trucking company, and his mother, Willie Mae, was a homemaker. He was a high school football star and idolized Jim Brown, the Browns' star fullback. Johnson ran for 4,308 yards and 40 touchdowns as a pro and scored another 15 receiving touchdowns. His single-season Giants rushing record stood until 1985, when Joe Morris ran for 1,336 yards. He shares the club record of four touchdowns in a game with running back Rodney Hampton and receiver Earnest Gray. Johnson is survived by his wife; a sister, Jean; a son, Chris; a daughter, Allison; and three grandchildren. His brother Alex, a major league outfielder for 13 seasons, won the 1970 American League batting championship, hitting .329 for the California Angels. Johnson received bachelor's and master's degrees in business from Michigan, worked as a financial analyst for Dean Witter, and then founded the Rackson Corporation, which is based in Totowa, N.J., and New York City and operates fast food outlets in several states. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1992. Fourteen years later, he became the hall's first member to be chairman of the National Football Foundation, which operates it. Johnson's family told The New York Times in 2011 that he had never received a concussion diagnosis and that his mother and a brother also had Alzheimer's disease. But the possible connection between football contact and long-term neurological disability has been a rising concern. Johnson received between $88,000 and $130,000 annually under the 88 Plan, a fund operated by the N.F.L. and its players' union that helps retired players with dementia. He had sustained knee and thigh injuries while playing football and had neck surgery in 1988 to remove two vertebrae. In reflecting on her husband's neurological illness and her fears for him after football, Karen Johnson told The Times in 2011 how ""I was always worried about the appendages."" ""I always thought it would be something physical, something with the knees, arthritis,"" she said. ""This came out of the dark."""

Crowley III are to be married Nov. 11 at the Butterfly Conservatory, Fairchild Garden in Coral Gables, Fla. Ashley Jansen, a friend of the couple who was ordained by the Renewal of the Spirit Institute, is to officiate in a nondenominational ceremony. The bride, who is 62 and will be taking her husband's name, is a Miami-based National Geographic explorer and anthropologist. She graduated from Brigham Young University-Hawaii, and received a Ph.D. in cultural anthropology with a specialization in ethnonavigation from the Union Institute in Cincinnati, through which the majority of her four years of course work was completed at the University of Hawaii, Manoa Campus, Honolulu, and the University of Hawaii, Hilo Campus.

Mr. Crowley, who has two grown sons, lived in Miami. She had been widowed for nearly 11 years, and he for 12. ""The thing that impressed me the most about George was that he never talked about what he did for a living,"" Dr. Lindsey said. ""I was much more interested in a man who didn't define himself by what he did, or what he had."" She was in fact, more interested in ""how he lived, and what his friends thought about him,"" she said. That is why Dr. Lindsey, an explorer by trade, decided to visit Mr. Crowley in Miami before he visited her. ""He offered to come out to Los Angeles but I thought it would be much more revelatory to see him in his own environment,"" she said. ""I did just that, and much like George, I found his friends to be all very quietly accomplished. They were sophisticated, well educated and well traveled, they just didn't talk much about themselves."" Ms. Lindsey was not alone in her search for the perfect mate. ""I was looking for someone who was spiritual, and through her big heart, I could see that Elizabeth's spirituality was palpable,"" Mr. Crowley said. ""She was also an amazingly accomplished woman with great intellect and curiosity."" They went on a first date to a restaurant in Miami, and on a second to the Butterfly Conservatory in Coral Gables, where their long-distance relationship took flight.

News,2018-11-11,The hotel industry is betting that a simple device can help solve the complex problem of guests sexually assaulting and harassing workers.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/us/panic-buttons-hotel-me-too.html,1192," The hotel industry is betting that a simple device can help solve the complex problem of guests sexually assaulting and harassing workers. It's known as a panic button, a small gadget that housekeepers can use to swiftly call for help. The technology takes different forms, including GPS devices that track employees as they walk through the building, buttons that emit an audible alarm and smartphone apps. After a yearlong cascade of stories about the sexual harassment of hotel workers, questions about how to address the problem remain largely unanswered. The most popular solution, one that hotel executives and labor activists can agree on, is small enough to fit in a pocket. Through company policy or legislation pushed by local officials, panic buttons have become increasingly widespread at hotels across the country. But the hotel industry has fiercely resisted measures that would punish the accused, saying that they would threaten guests' due process rights. Juana Melara, a housekeeper in Southern California, believes a panic button could have gotten her out of a frightening situation several years ago when she was working in Cerritos, Calif. Ms. Melara said she was cleaning a bathtub in a hotel room when she turned to see a guest staring at her. She asked him to leave the room and went on her break. When she returned to her housekeeping cart, she said, the man was walking in the hallway toward her with his penis pulled through his pants. ""I was so scared, I said, 'Oh my God, what do I do?'"" Ms. Melara said in an interview. ""The rooms were empty — there were a lot of checkouts on Sunday. There was not anyone who could hear me."" Ms. Melara, 53, said she escaped into a nearby room and locked the door. She called her supervisor and the front desk but said that no one came to the room for about 20 minutes. When she moved to Long Beach, Calif., years later, Ms. Melara continued to work as a housekeeper and began organizing with Unite Here, a union that represents hotel workers that was advocating a law mandating panic buttons at hotels. Statewide legislation failed earlier this year, but on Tuesday, separate ballot measures in Long Beach and Oakland requiring panic buttons at hotels of a certain size passed easily. Over the past year, Seattle has become the main battleground for the industry and the hospitality union's dueling interests. Two years ago, voters approved a ballot measure mandating panic buttons and instituting a system that would place guests accused of sexual misconduct on a blacklist, which would make hotel workers aware of their presence but not bar them. Under the ordinance, if a hotel worker makes a sworn statement accusing a guest of sexual misconduct or if evidence supports the accusation, the guest would be barred from returning to that hotel for three years. If the worker makes the accusation without signing an affidavit, the guest's name will be added to the list for five years. If the worker agrees, the hotel should report the allegations to the police. In late 2016, the American Hotel and Lodging Association, the main trade group representing major hotel chains, and other local trade organizations sued the city over the ordinance. The groups argued that requiring hotel management to bar and blacklist guests would violate guests' due-process rights. ""That told us loud and clear that the industry was more concerned about their guests' comfort level than protecting their employees from sexual harassment,"" said Erik Van Rossum, the president of Unite Here's chapter in the Northwest, which covers Seattle and Portland, Ore. The hotel and lodging association counters that workers' safety is a top priority. But Katherine Lugar, the association's president, said it objected to the ordinance partly because ""we don't believe it's prudent to put a Seattle employee in the position of acting as a surrogate for law enforcement."" In June 2017, a judge ruled in favor of the city, but the trade groups appealed and were back in court arguing their case this month. While the hotel trade group fights these rules, it has embraced panic buttons as worth a significant financial investment. Chicago officials estimated that a hotel security system including panic buttons with tracking capabilities would cost about $100 per room. The lower-tech option that emits an audible alarm is about $25 per device, a Hyatt spokeswoman said. This fall, 17 hotel brands — including major chains like Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott — said they would put the safety devices in place at all their hotels across the country by 2020. Industry groups were not always enthusiastic backers of the devices. Ms. Lugar said the trade association previously had concerns that the hotel union was using worker safety as a ""fig leaf for labor's laundry list of other wants and desires."" Panic buttons were under consideration, and in some places, in operation, before the #MeToo movement, Ms. Lugar said. But the cultural reckoning has clearly played into the industry's calculations. For many years, business leaders rarely prioritized protecting their workers, said Tina Tchen, a lawyer who served as Michelle Obama's chief of staff. Management did only as much as the law required when it came to sexual harassment policies and training, said Ms. Tchen, who advised hotel chains this year on the panic button initiative. ""One of the failings of the past is that we looked at anti-sexual-harassment policies and trainings as one-size-fits-all,"" she said. ""That's why people tuned out."" Before the hotel industry embraced panic buttons, cities including Chicago and Miami Beach, Fla., mandated them through ordinances passed by their city councils. Collective bargaining agreements have also required the devices at union hotels. New York was the first city to require panic buttons on a broad scale when the provision was included in a contract struck in 2012, the year after a hotel housekeeper accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the chief of the International Monetary Fund and a French politician, of sexually assaulting her. Washington, D.C., followed suit with its own agreement. But enacting legislation that includes measures to punish guests has proved difficult in the shadow of Seattle's legal battle. In California and Chicago, the bills initially were supposed to be modeled on Seattle's ordinance, including the provisions on barring and blacklisting certain guests. Later, those provisions were abandoned. Laws in cities including Seattle and Chicago require hotels to maintain sexual harassment policies with procedures to follow if an employee reports harassment by a guest, such as allowing them to temporarily work at a location separate from the alleged harasser. Some hotels are encountering practical challenges as they put the panic button technology in place. Four months after Chicago mandated panic buttons, some small hotels are struggling to pay for the technology, said Alderman Michelle Harris. Larger hotels, she noted, had faced challenges with establishing reliable Wi-Fi connections in every corner of their buildings. In California, Al Muratsuchi, an Assembly member who spearheaded the legislation there, said he had not given up on a statewide law. Although he wants to find a way to punish guests accused of sexual misconduct, he said the panic buttons are the first step."

The first three are board members of MoMA PS1, where Mr. Biesenbach had been director through late October. All four are based in major art capitals outside of California. Mr. Cheng, from Hong Kong, founded the K11 Art Foundation to give Chinese artists a more international platform and serves as a board director of the National Museum of China Foundation and a board member of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, among others. Mr. Mordant, from Sydney, is chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia and a member of the Tate and MoMA International Councils. Ms. Stoschek, from Berlin, a collector of video, performance and other time-based art, is a co-chairman of the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art. Ms. French, from New York, is a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Academy in Berlin. Ms. French has also been involved with MoMA PS1, though not as a trustee. ""She made MoMA PS1 free for New Yorkers for five years in a row,"" said Mr. Biesenbach. Her commitment to free museum admission might come in handy, as Mr. Biesenbach has been seriously considering suggestions from local arts leaders that he take the Museum of Contemporary Art free of charge, along the lines of the city's other contemporary museums, the Broad and the Hammer. But he said he is not rushing into anything, given ""all the implications that free admission could have,"" not just in lost entrance fees but also lost membership revenue and possibly increased staffing and facilities needs. ""I think it needs very careful, responsible evaluation. Fiscal responsibility is very important for this institution — it's definitely factual that the museum's financial problems in the past were life-threatening,"" he said, referring to the museum's near-collapse a decade ago, when its endowment dropped below $10 million. (It now stands around $134 million.) A larger and more supportive board is one safeguard against these sorts of problems. MOCA now has 41 board members, not counting lifetime trustees. Before Mr. Biesenbach's arrival, the latest addition to the board was Sean Parker, a co-founder of Napster and an early Facebook president."

The loudest noise on a recent day was the autumn breeze whistling in the trees. There were a few streets of stone houses, a 13th-century church, one baker and not much else. So it may come as a surprise that late last year, Mr. Gentilhomme wrote a letter to President Emmanuel Macron telling him that the stress was too much and that he was quitting. He could not stand watching his village of 400 wither anymore. ""After 30 years, I've had enough,"" wrote Mr. Gentilhomme, a vigorous 77-year-old former French Navy SEAL diver. ""The compromises, the unkept promises and the state's withdrawal have used me up, morally and physically.'' His letter speaks to a broader anxiety in France's heartland. This year, like him, more than 150 of the country's mayors, mostly rural, have quit. The number of mayors quitting their posts may be at an all-time high, up anywhere from 32 percent to 50 percent over the previous electoral cycle, according to the French news media. The resignations provide an echo of the larger clash taking place in France today between Mr. Macron's drive to shake up the country's sometimes archaic institutions, untouched for centuries, and a way of life that may no longer be sustainable. [Read about Mr. Macron warning this past week of the dangers of nationalism as he hosted world leaders to commemorate the end of World War I 100 years ago on Sunday.] It is in villages where the president's ambition to pare back the government most squarely runs up against French traditions and expectations — one of which is that the state provides services and should make its authority felt in even the quietest corners. That has long been the role of the village mayor, as much a French specialty as the 17th-century castle that graces Mr. Gentilhomme's tiny territory, and almost as anachronistic. Mayors have been a mainstay of French life since the revolutionaries of 1789 decreed that wherever a church steeple arises — even if only a few houses are clustered around it — there should be a mayor. It has remained this way ever since. No country on the Continent surpasses France's 35,502 mayors, who make up 40 percent of all the mayors in the European Union. Twenty thousand of these towns have fewer than 500 inhabitants. But even before Mr. Macron came to office in May 2017, France was confronting the question of whether it could still afford so many little fiefs, which were already straining under cost cutting and administrative ""regroupings."" Under a 2015 law, small towns were ordered to combine into administrative units of at least 15,000 people, where 5,000 had been the previous benchmark. Real power — to handle economic development, to manage water, even to raise taxes — passed to the new clusters. Now the young president has accelerated that drive toward even more administrative efficiency. ""In the era of the internet, fast transport and cuts in local funding, it makes sense for these towns to group themselves together to confront these new challenges,"" said Jean-René Cazeneuve, a Macron deputy in the French Parliament who is studying why so many mayors are resigning. ""It's Emmanuel Macron who wants to speed things up, who wants to reform,"" Mr. Cazeneuve said. ""And that could make local officials feel uneasy about their future."" No doubt it has. More mayors are shedding the sash that denotes their authority, as the appeal of presiding over the tricolor flag that flutters outside every mairie, or town hall, is not what it used to be. ""There's something going on,"" said Christian Le Bart, an expert in local government at Sciences Po university in Rennes. ""They have the impression of being abandoned by the state, and of being more and more criticized by their citizens."" The departures — a small fraction of the total, to be sure — reflect the struggle of villages in rural France to remain alive while trapped in a spiral of shrinking revenues and declining populations. But the cure, the mayors say, has steadily left them with less money and less authority, but with no fewer burdens. ""We do everything,"" said Jean-Claude Bellini, who recently quit as mayor of nearby Chaux. ""It's always, 'call the mayor, call the mayor.'"" Indeed, experts say, even with the regroupings and the cuts, there is a logic — a very French logic — in keeping the mayor in city hall. ""Their reason for being is proximity,"" said Matthieu Leprince, an economics professor and expert on local finance at the University of Western Brittany in Brest. ""They know the turf."" That has made the quiet revolt among France's mayors — whose ears are closest to the citizen's mouth — an important measure of grass-roots resistance to Mr. Macron's reform drive. The resistance comes at a time where Mr. Macron is looking to position himself as the leader of Europe and the chief defender of its liberal values, as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany prepares to exit the stage. National polls show his support dwindling, most strikingly in the ""deep France"" of the provinces. Mr. Macron is considered the president of France's thriving big cities, not its left-behind periphery. But money has its own logic, too, and funds from Paris have dropped sharply over the last two years, Mr. Gentilhomme said. Overall, the state's contribution to France's towns has dropped to 30 billion euros, or about $34 billion, in 2017, when Mr. Macron was elected, from 42 billion euros in 2014. At the same time, Mr. Macron has vowed to cut a main source of local revenue, the lodging tax, which brings in a total of 22 billion euros annually, or about $25 billion, and makes up 10 percent of the average village's budget. The tax is paid by anyone who owns, rents or lives in a home or apartment — just about everyone in France — and Mr. Macron's pledge to get rid of it was one of his most popular campaign promises. While that promises to lighten the tax load on local residents, it has made the mayors — who booed Mr. Macron at their meeting last year — particularly furious. The president has said he will make up the shortfall, but mayors are distrustful that he will. ""There's a real threat to the financial autonomy of these towns,"" said Ludovic Rochette, who heads the mayor's association in the Côte d'Or department in Burgundy.  The mayors, he said, had long felt disrespected by the authorities in Paris, but they had hoped for a change with Mr. Macron. ""We thought that with him, finally, there would be dialogue between Paris and the territories,"" Mr. Rochette said. ""But cutting out the lodging tax was the last straw. And we've all cut and cut, and now we're down to the bone."" Aware of the frustration, Mr. Macron last month beefed up his local affairs ministry, vowing more attentiveness. But that was too late for mayors like Mr. Gentilhomme. Where he lives in the Côte d'Or, the heart of Burgundy's legendary wine country, the local mayor's association says resignations have increased 52 percent over the period from 2008 to 2014. ""My struggle for the survival of our countryside was misunderstood, and barely supported,"" Mr. Gentilhomme wrote the president. The short letter back from Mr. Macron was signed, but that was the only human touch. It spoke dryly of ""institutional stability"" and promised to simplify the administrative regroupings. But that consolidation was exactly what Mr. Gentilhomme had fought against, as he was pushed from a regrouping of 11 villages into one of 26. Mr. Cazeneuve, the parliamentary deputy, thinks the consolidations could be a prime reason behind the resignation wave — an end to the distinctive French dream of being king of one's own small domain. ""It's better to be first in the village than second in Rome,"" he said. But second, even in the village, is another thing entirely. ""I walked to the mairie every day,"" Mr. Gentilhomme said. ""And they didn't hesitate to call out to me, or even to come to the house. They think the mayor can do everything."" ""'There's no water, there's no electricity, so, it's got be the mayor,'"" he said, mimicking the complaints that came piling down. ""On your own turf, people think you are the good Lord,"" Mr. Gentilhomme said. ""But in reality, you can't do much of anything."""
News,2018-11-11,Shane Parrish was a cybersecurity expert at Canada’s top intelligence agency and an occasional blogger when he noticed something curious about his modest readership six years ago: 80 percent of his followers worked on Wall Street.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/business/intelligence-expert-wall-street.html,1403," Shane Parrish was a cybersecurity expert at Canada's top intelligence agency and an occasional blogger when he noticed something curious about his modest readership six years ago: 80 percent of his followers worked on Wall Street. The blog was meant to be a method of self-improvement, helping Mr. Parrish deal with a job whose pressures had increased with the growing threat of global hacking. But his lonely riffs — on how learning deeply, thinking widely and reading books strategically could improve decision-making skills — had found an eager audience among hedge fund titans and mutual fund executives, many of whom were still licking their wounds after the financial crisis. ""People just found us,"" Mr. Parrish said. ""We became a thing on Wall Street."" His website, Farnam Street, urges visitors to ""Upgrade Yourself."" In saying as much, Mr. Parrish is promoting strategies of rigorous self-betterment as opposed to classic self-help fare — which appeals to his overachieving audience in elite finance, Silicon Valley and professional sports. His many maxims cite Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bertrand Russell and even Frank Zappa. (""A mind is like a parachute. It doesn't work if it is not open."") Today, Mr. Parrish's community of striving financiers is clamoring for more of him. That means calling on him to present his thoughts and book ideas to employees and clients; attending his regular reading and think weeks in Hawaii, Paris and the Bahamas; and in some cases hiring him to be their personal decision-making coach. ""These guys are driven to get that incremental edge — they are competitive, gladiatorial in that respect,"" said Mr. Parrish, 39. ""We are trying to get people to ask themselves better questions and reflect. If you can do that, you will be better able to handle the speed and variety of changing environments."" To do that, Mr. Parrish advises investors like Scott Miller, the founder of Greenhaven Road Capital, to disconnect from the noise and read deeply. ""I will leave my computer and go into a separate room to read,"" said Mr. Miller, an early sponsor of Farnam Street who is currently reading ""Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones,"" by James Clear. ""It feels weird to do this in the middle of the day — but I do it."" Mr. Parrish's site has drawn the attention of some of the biggest names in finance. Dan Loeb, one of the more prominent hedge fund executives on Wall Street, is a big fan. And Ray Dalio of Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund, recently did a podcast with him. ""Shane is a special person,"" Mr. Loeb said via email. Few Wall Street obsessions surpass the pursuit of an investment edge. In an earlier era, before computers and the internet, this advantage was largely brain power: Warren Buffett plucking a nugget from an annual report or George Soros making a seismic bet against a currency. Today, information is just another commodity. And the edge belongs to algorithms, data sets and funds that track indexes and countless other investment themes. This has been devastating for hedge fund and mutual fund managers who make their living trying to outsmart the stock market. With their business models under attack, they are searching for answers. And Mr. Parrish has a simple solution: reading, reflection and lifelong learning. ""These days, if you are not getting better you are falling behind,"" said Mr. Parrish, who is reading ""The Laws of Human Nature,"" an examination of human behavior that draws on examples of historical figures by Robert Greene. ""Reading is a way to consume people's experiences, to learn something timeless and then apply it to your life."" Chuck Royce, the founder and former chief executive officer of Royce mutual funds, who oversees $4 billion in investments, said he stumbled on Mr. Parrish's site and related to it immediately. Mr. Royce developed a reputation as one of the industry's most astute fund managers, specializing in small, high-quality companies in the 1970s. But in the recent period of low interest rates, his main mutual fund's performance has suffered. ""I failed to understand that in this period of zero rates, inferior companies would outperform high-quality companies,"" said Mr. Royce, who was part of a group that spent a long weekend talking books and big ideas with Mr. Parrish in Hawaii two years ago. Mr. Royce has embraced Mr. Parrish's core principles. He gets up at 5:30 every morning to do his daily reading, which currently includes ""Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Bets When you Don't Have All the Cards"" by Annie Duke, a former poker champion — and a big favorite among investors these days. At the office, Mr. Royce works from a couch strewn with papers. His Bloomberg terminal is in another room. ""It is all about habits,"" Mr. Royce said. ""Setting goals is easy — but without good habits you are not getting there."" Some executives have long sought insight from the printed page — and not just in the business section. Emmanuel Roman, the chief executive officer of the bond giant Pimco — who is reading ""On Grand Strategy,"" an assessment of the decisions of notable historical leaders by the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer John Lewis Gaddis — called reading ""a pure passion."" And Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman of Goldman Sachs, has talked up the benefits of reading books, especially those not related to economics or finance. Mr. Parrish is an unlikely guru, a computer scientist from Halifax, Nova Scotia, who seems bemused by his sudden cachet. On a recent swing through New York to meet with clients, Mr. Parrish was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts and carried a worn backpack. Slight and balding, he looked more like an unhurried graduate student than a counselor to some of the wealthiest executives on Wall Street. Mr. Parrish joined the Communications Security Establishment, a division of Canada's Defence Department, straight out of college. His first day was Aug. 28, 2001, and he was soon promoted in the tumult that followed the Sept. 11 attacks. Suddenly, he was managing a large staff at the age of 24. Wanting to improve his decision-making skills, Mr. Parrish found inspiration in Charlie Munger — Warren Buffett's longtime investment partner. Mr. Parrish quickly became an acolyte, drawn to Mr. Munger's thoughts on multidisciplinary thinking and mental models. He pored over Berkshire Hathaway annual reports and became a regular attendee of Mr. Buffett's yearly meetings in Omaha. The name of his site is another tribute to the billionaire investor: Berkshire Hathaway's address in Omaha is 3555 Farnam Street. Last year, Mr. Parrish left intelligence work to tend to the site full time. He would not disclose how much his various projects were making. Farnam Street now consists of book lists, essays, podcasts and a vibrant social network — all of which are anchored by Mr. Parrish's self-improvement musings. There are also branded goodies to be had, such as a decision-making journal and a Farnam Street thinking cap. Some 190,000 people have signed up to Brain Food, his free weekly newsletter. Mr. Parrish's more dedicated followers pay $250 a year to become part of his ""knowledge community"" — a premium site with a private discussion forum and additional content. They have flocked to his social network, trading book ideas and meet-up suggestions in Toronto, Dubai and London. James Aitken, an independent investment adviser in London who counsels some of the world's largest investors, was among the readers that came upon Mr. Parrish in 2012. Since then, Mr. Aitken has revamped his work habits, pushing himself to disconnect from all his screens and read books — ideally for at least two hours a day. ""He is so indispensable to me that, beyond becoming a part of his network, I will occasionally write him a check at the end of the year,"" Mr. Aitken said. Mr. Aitken now pushes his clients to increase the time they spend reading and thinking away from their screens. Twice a year he sends out a list of books — including history, biography, finance and economics, self-help, and more — from which clients can choose a number of books as gifts. He has sent out about 2,300 over the past 10 years. ""Every world-class investor is questioning right now how they can improve,"" he said. ""So, in a machine-driven age where everything is driven by speed, perhaps the edge is judgment, time and perspective."""

So far, dozens of people have been confirmed dead and hundreds more are missing. Vast expanses of land have been scorched in Northern California by the Camp Fire — the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history — and in Southern California by the Woolsey and Hill Fires. Here's how you can help. Remember to do your research on a charity's reputation for using donations effectively. Charity Navigator is a good source to consult. Also, remember that sending money is almost always the most efficient way to help in a disaster, according to the Center for International Disaster Information, part of the United States Agency for International Development. If volunteers on the ground end up with a mountain of donated goods, they'll have to spend time sorting through them rather than buying exactly what's needed. American Red Cross: This nonprofit has opened shelters across the state to help evacuees. They also have an online tool that people can use to register themselves as safe so loved ones can find them. California Community Foundation's Wildfire Relief Fund: For 15 years, the foundation has offered aid to those affected by wildfires. Grants have gone to rebuilding homes, providing financial and mental health assistance and helping those affected to get medical treatment. California Fire Foundation: This organization is on the ground distributing financial assistance to people who have lost everything in the fires. Through its emergency assistance program, firefighters distribute pre-paid gift cards to help those who need to purchase necessities like food, medicine and clothing. Caring Choices: This nonprofit, which is in Chico, Calif., has turned into a hub for organizing volunteers to help those affected by the Camp Fire. Volunteers are assigned a variety of duties, including caring for displaced animals and, for those who are certified doctors or nurses, offering medical care. The organization has paused taking on new volunteers for the next few days but still encourages applications. It said it will need extra hands in the coming weeks. Caring Choices is also seeking monetary donations for its operations. Enloe Medical Center: This 298-bed hospital is in Chico, the site of multiple evacuation centers for the Camp Fire. It is accepting donations for patients and families who have been displaced. Entertainment Industry Foundation: This nonprofit, started by Hollywood stars, has a fund that helps firefighters and other emergency workers battling California wildfires. One of its beneficiaries is the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation, which provides hydration backpacks and night vision goggles for helicopter pilots. Humane Society of Ventura County: This nonprofit is accepting donations to help animals displaced by the Woolsey and Hill Fires. It is taking in domestic animals, such as dogs, cats and birds, as well as livestock. North Valley Community Foundation: This nonprofit in Chico is raising money to support organizations that are sheltering evacuees of the Camp Fire. These could include churches, fairgrounds and community centers, said Logan Todd, a foundation spokesman. Salvation Army: At both ends of the state, the Salvation Army is providing meals to shelters in local churches, fairgrounds and a community college. United Way of Greater Los Angeles: This local branch of the national organization is raising money for those affected by the Woolsey and Hill Fires, specifically to help low-income residents. United Way of Northern California: This local chapter of the national nonprofit has established a disaster relief fund to offer emergency cash and help to people who have lost their homes, according to a news release. There are multiple crowdfunding efforts for victims of the California fires. GoFundMe has organized a page that catalogs the relief efforts in Northern and Southern California. It includes links to donate to families who have lost their homes. Google is collecting donations to help those affected by the wildfires in Southern California. It will funnel the donations to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, which will distribute the money to local nonprofits. Additionally, Airbnb has launched a program that asks people to open their homes to those affected by the fires. Until Nov. 29, the company is allowing residents to mark their homes as a place for evacuees and aid workers to stay for free."
News,2018-11-12,"SYDNEY, Australia — The Queensland police have arrested a former strawberry industry worker for spiking strawberries with needles, a crime that fueled a nationwide scare that crippled Australia’s strawberry industry.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/world/australia/strawberries-needles-woman-arrested.html,436," SYDNEY, Australia — The Queensland police have arrested a former strawberry industry worker for spiking strawberries with needles, a crime that fueled a nationwide scare that crippled Australia's strawberry industry. The woman, a former supervisor at a strawberry farm in Queensland, was arrested Sunday and has been charged with seven counts of contamination of goods. The police say there was a ""circumstance of aggravation,"" meaning that if convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison. The local news media identified her as My Ut Trinh, 50. ""This has probably been one of the most trying investigations that I've been a part of,"" Jon Wacker, a detective superintendent of the Drug and Serious Crime Group, said in a news conference on Monday. News that fruit was being tampered with first broke in September, after several people reported discovering needles in strawberries they had purchased. One 7-year-old girl bit into a contaminated strawberry but was not harmed. Another man from Queensland was less lucky: he was hospitalized after he swallowed half a needle while eating the fruit. ""It put me into shock,"" the man, Hoani Hearne told 9 News in an interview. The incidents caused something of a nationwide hysteria, and led to more than 230 copycat incidents and false reports of similar strawberry spikings. Needles were also reported in some bananas and apples. Officials began urging people to cut up their strawberries before eating them. Some supermarkets in Australia stopped stocking the fruit, and videos circulated of farmers dumping tons of ripe strawberries. Ultimately, 68 strawberry brands were affected, with 49 of them in Queensland, the police said. The events had a ""crippling impact,"" bringing Queensland's strawberry industry ""to its knees"" Jennifer Rowling, a spokeswoman for the Queensland Strawberry Growers Association, said in a statement Sunday. ""It was a crisis driven by social media and the only real victims were the strawberry growers, and to some extent other Australian fruit growers and exporters,"" she added. In response, lawmakers pushed through tougher penalties for those found guilty of food contamination. The Queensland government announced that it would provide 1 million Australian dollars, or about $720,000, to offset the financial impact on the strawberry industry. The state produces 30,000 tons of strawberries each season — 40 percent of the country's strawberries, they said. While the grower's association had said it suspected a ""disgruntled ex-employee"" of carrying out the initial contaminations, the woman's exact motives remain unknown. She will appear before a Brisbane court on Monday. ""All farmers and growers sincerely hope there will not be a repeat of past events,"" Ms. Rowling said. Strawberry sales are returning to normal, she added."
briefing,2018-11-12,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/briefing/world-war-1-california-gaza-strip.html,1311," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Europe marks a century since World War I, wildfires engulf California and a start-up sends satellites into space.  Here's the latest: • A rebuke of nationalism on Armistice Day. Dozens of leaders from around the world gathered in Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of the armistice ending World War I. But a ceremony meant to celebrate the ties that bind the world today instead showcased the divisions that are pulling it apart. Above, President Trump at Suresnes American Cemetery in France. President Emmanuel Macron of France, whose relationship with Mr. Trump has soured, used the occasion to denounce the resurgence of nationalism, which has been embraced by Mr. Trump and other European leaders, but also contributed to igniting the Great War. With memories of the world wars — which many believe helped unite Europe — fading and being replaced by those of financial crises, an influx of migrants and a sense that the promise of a united Europe is not delivering, many see the old demons of chauvinism and ethnic division again spreading across the Continent. Here's how world leaders commemorated the centenary. _____ • Top Saudi intelligence officials close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed hiring companies last year to kill Iranian enemies of the kingdom, according to people familiar with the discussions. Their discussions, more than a year before the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, indicate that top Saudi officials have considered assassinations since the beginning of Prince Mohammed's ascent. Mr. Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last month. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said audio recordings of Mr. Khashoggi's killing had been given to the United States and other Western countries. His disclosure intensifies the pressure on President Trump, who has refused to assign blame for the crime, to take stronger punitive measures against his allies in Saudi Arabia. Above, a person wearing a mask of the dead journalist. _____ • California is burning. At least 29 people have died as the Camp Fire engulfs large swaths in the north, matching the deadliest wildfire in the state's history. Above, burned cars in Paradise, Calif. In Southern California, two more died in fires near Los Angeles that forced evacuations in Malibu and Thousand Oaks, a city that was still reeling from a mass shooting last week. International readers said they didn't understand why Americans let gun violence persist. Once a seasonal worry, fires have recently become a near-constant terror in California. President Trump blamed ""gross mismanagement of the forests"" for the infernos, drawing outrage from local leaders. Thousands of firefighters are working to contain the blazes, but their efforts are being complicated by a forecast of strong winds. _____ • ""This territory is not yours."" Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's far-right president-elect, wants to do away with indigenous territories in the Amazon rain forest, which are protected by law. But descendants of the original inhabitants of the Amazon were growing more vulnerable long before Mr. Bolsonaro's victory. Bands of miners, loggers and farmers have been clearing the forest at a rate environmentalists call unsustainable, radically reshaping the land and harming indigenous communities. The Times traveled hundreds of miles into the Brazilian Amazon, staying with a tribe in the Munduruku Indigenous Territory, above, as it struggled with the shrinking rain forest and confronted illegal gold miners. ""We don't depend on gold, but rather the fruits and animals you are driving away,"" one tribe member said to a mining camp leader. • Treatment for conditions like cancer remains inaccessible for much of China's population despite the country's socialized health care system, so ""cancer refugees"" like the one above are hunting around the world and on the internet for ways to stay alive. • Facebook said it would drop forced arbitration in sexual harassment cases, a day after Google announced similar plans amid pressure from its employees. • Groups around the world highlighted the gender pay gap by noting the day of the year when women would start working without pay, relative to men's annual earnings. • Coming this week: The U.S. International Trade Commission will submit a report to President Trump on the economic impact of the new Nafta deal, and a painting by the English artist David Hockney is estimated to fetch $80 million at auction. •  Here's a snapshot of global markets. • France's rural mayors are resigning in droves, saying they feel abandoned by President Emmanuel Macron's overhauls. Above, Louis Gentilhomme, the former mayor of Saint-Seine-Sur-Vingeanne. [The New York Times] • In the Gaza Strip, a covert Israeli operation gone wrong left at least seven Palestinians and one Israeli dead, in addition to breaking a nascent cease-fire.

News,2018-11-12,"Information may want to be free, as an aphorism had it in the early days of digital media. But these days, increasingly, journalism wants to be paid for.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/business/media/new-york-magazine-paywall.html,445," Information may want to be free, as an aphorism had it in the early days of digital media. But these days, increasingly, journalism wants to be paid for. New York Media, the parent company of New York magazine, will become the latest publisher to institute a paywall when it starts charging for access to its websites. Under its longtime editor, Adam Moss, New York was a pioneer in breaking various areas of coverage into separate websites known as verticals. Its related online offerings are composed of the flagship NYMag.com, The Cut (fashion), Grub Street (food), Intelligencer (politics), The Strategist (shopping) and Vulture (pop culture). The move to a metered paywall has been in the works for a year, said Pamela Wasserstein, the daughter of the late New York magazine owner Bruce Wasserstein and the company's chief executive since 2016. ""I think it's the next evolution in what we do,"" she added. New York Media is now joining other publishing companies or individual publications that have recently added paywalls, including Bloomberg Media, The Atlantic and the Condé Nast magazines Vanity Fair, The New Yorker and Wired. Subscriptions for the New York Media sites will cost $5 a month or $50 annually. For $70 a year, the company will include a subscription to New York magazine, the onetime weekly that started publishing every other week in 2014. The pay model, which will allow readers a number of stories free before shutting off access, will go into effect the last week of November, according to the company, which would not specify a date for the change. NYMag.com will undergo a slight redesign at the same time. Mr. Moss said he planned to further incorporate the content from the various sites into the flagship site. The paywall will not apply to The City, a soon-to-debut nonprofit site focused on coverage of New York City, which announced a partnership with the magazine in September. With the magazine industry in financial trouble, the New York sites have maintained a loyal readership. According to Comscore, its family of sites had 29 million unique viewers in September, a 45 percent increase compared with last year. The print publication's average circulation has held steady at over 400,000, with about 300,000 in home subscriptions and roughly 90,000 of that number denoting copies sent to doctors' offices and other business locations. In August, The Wall Street Journal reported that New York Media was exploring a sale. In an interview last week, Ms. Wasserstein said that interested parties had contacted her and she did not deny taking their inquiries seriously. ""Frankly, it's nice that people find us interesting and are interested in what we do,"" she said."
News,2018-11-12,[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/nyregion/amazon-queens-queensbridge-houses.html,1383," [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Until recently, the most important thing to know about Amazon for residents of the Queensbridge Houses, the country's largest public housing project, was that any packages left in a lobby would likely be stolen. But Amazon will soon be a far larger presence in their New York City neighborhood. The company owned by Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, will announce on Tuesday that it will establish a major headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, where Queensbridge's 26 aging buildings are home to a mostly black and Hispanic population with a median household income of $15,843, well below the federal poverty line for a family of four. Here, where livings are eked out on meager paychecks, or social service assistance, with nearly 60 percent of its households relying on food stamps, the new neighbor will be one of the world's most profitable high-tech companies, bringing what could be a work force of 25,000 people making salaries upward of $100,000. The stark contrast amplifies some of the social and economic tensions coursing through American society — a widening income gap, a lack of access to high-paying jobs for many minorities and a technology sector struggling to diversify. The planned location for the new headquarters is still unclear, as is whether Amazon will deliver any benefits to the roughly 6,000 people who live in the Queensbridge Houses and other disadvantaged parts of the neighborhood. ""What are they going to do for the community? Are they going to guarantee us employment opportunities?"" said April Simpson, the president of Queensbridge Tenants Association. ""I'm worried about, when they come, they're not going to have opportunities for people. Not just people from Queensbridge — but other lower- and middle-income people in this area. ""That's why we're leery about them coming in."" As New York City seeks to challenge Silicon Valley's dominance as a tech hub — Google recently announced plans for a significant expansion in New York — the explosion of jobs has helped propel the local economy. But it has not mitigated the ""tale of two cities"" narrative of economic disparity that Mayor Bill de Blasio has vowed to address in a city where the poverty rate in 2016 was 19.5 percent, significantly higher than the national rate. That stratification is keenly felt in Queensbridge, a gritty complex just across the East River from the East Side of Manhattan and some of the wealthiest neighborhoods and real estate in the country. Hard by the Queensboro Bridge, the Queensbridge Houses have been plagued with crime and drugs. Those problems have eased in recent years, Ms. Simpson said, and community programs have improved the quality of life. Last year, the housing project did not record a single shooting, something that had not happened in more than a decade and was a source of pride. But the neglect that afflicts many public housing developments and has led to harsh criticism of the de Blasio administration, persists here, residents and other local leaders said. ""There are still a lot of problems with the apartments — the lack of heat and hot water, non-working elevators, mold and broken front doors,"" said Jimmy Van Bramer, the city councilman whose district includes the Queensbridge Houses. Tyshema Basnight, 42, said she had been trying to rejoin the work force after raising a family. She has an associate degree in computer science and a tech job at Amazon would be a dream job, she said. ""For now, I'm just looking for secretarial work,"" said Ms. Basnight, who was among several residents lined up for one of the few aging computers available in the tenants association office for residents who do not have computers of their own. The office is not on the cutting edge of the digital frontier. And all the buzz over the e-commerce behemoth transforming Long Island City into a gleaming new-economy tech hub was met with skepticism, if not outright hostility. Many businesses — including travel and financial companies and hotel chains — have opened in recent years in the area, but Ms. Simpson said they have not hired local residents. ""They did not hire here — they brought in their own people,"" she said. ""My thing is: If you build here, hire here."" A spokesman for Amazon, Sam Kennedy, declined to comment on its plans in New York, but said that the company has a proven track record of funding and creating programs for the needy in Seattle, where Amazon has its main headquarters. This includes donating tens of millions of dollars, creating affordable housing, opening a shelter in its office complex for homeless families and creating a training program for the food service and culinary industries for less-advantaged residents. In Queens, the new companies that have come to Long Island City have helped transform the semi-industrial waterfront neighborhood into a haven for moneyed professionals. Since 2010 more apartment buildings have been built in Long Island City than in any other neighborhood in the city. Apartments in the more than 40 new buildings sell for an average of over $1 million. But past the gleaming skyline of high-rises, many residents fear that Amazon's arrival will only intensify the gentrification that is making the neighborhood less affordable for people of limited means. It is still unknown what financial incentives city and state officials may have offered Amazon or what, if any concessions, they have extracted from the company to help the neighborhood. City officials noted that the Queensbridge Houses had already been the focus of attention with projects to replace the roofs on all 26 buildings and install nearly 900 new security lights and 360 surveillance cameras. Mr. de Blasio is grappling with a lead-paint scandal at the city's public housing agency and accusations that officials had downplayed the number of young children in public housing with elevated levels of lead in their blood. Amazon's arrival, city officials insisted, would yield tangible gains for area residents. They said they were considering setting up programs similar to a city-funded employment center in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. ""Securing training and good jobs for local residents — especially those living in Nycha — is central to the way we craft major economic development initiatives,"" said Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, referring to the New York City Housing Authority. ""This is a tremendous opportunity to bring tens of thousands of good jobs to our city and open up good-paying careers in technology for New Yorkers."" Still, Mr. Van Bramer questioned the city and state's eager courting of Amazon at a time when the housing complex is still in need of funding for basic repairs. ""If we are helping a headquarters with 25,000 employees move in, a stone's throw from the largest housing development in the United States of America, we need more than lip service for the people of Queensbridge,"" he said. ""Before we throw corporate welfare at the richest man in the world, we should think about the crisis in Nycha, and address the needs of the community, including training Queensbridge residents for tech jobs — or they will be looking through the glass from the outside."" Outside a cluster of stores in the center of the Queensbridge Houses, Piif Jones, 29, said he has Amazon packages delivered to a secure locker at a nearby local check-cashing center, to avoid having them stolen from his lobby. Mr. Jones is an up-and-coming rapper trying to follow the illustrious tradition of hip-hop artists — Nas, Mobb Deep, Marley Marl, and others — who have come out of the housing project and have chronicled its hardscrabble conditions in verse. He spoke of belonging to the Queensbridge ""family,"" and taking pride in its success stories. Mr. Jones said he trained on computers in high school and if his rap career fizzles, he would happily take a job at Amazon. ""If Amazon doesn't hire from this community, we should boycott them,"" he said. But Andrew Johnson, a sidewalk bookseller near the busy entrance to the 21st Street-Queensbridge station on the F Train, took a more positive attitude. ""Not everyone here has a Ph.D., but anyone eager to work should be able to get job,"" he said. ""It can't be nothing but a plus."""
News,2018-11-12,"NAPLES, Italy — Italy’s desperate need for a financial shot in the arm is palpable at all levels of the economy, from the entrepreneurs in the industrial north who are hungry for tax breaks and a streamlined bureaucracy to the welfare seekers in the poverty-stricken south, with its dizzying levels of youth unemployment.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/world/europe/italy-budget-european-union.html,1621," NAPLES, Italy — Italy's desperate need for a financial shot in the arm is palpable at all levels of the economy, from the entrepreneurs in the industrial north who are hungry for tax breaks and a streamlined bureaucracy to the welfare seekers in the poverty-stricken south, with its dizzying levels of youth unemployment. But how best to invigorate the Italian economy has reanimated a wrenching debate for Europe over whether to spend or cut in the face of financial peril. On Tuesday, Italy is expected to resubmit a largely unchanged and high-spending budget to the European Union, which is expected to reject it, for a second time, and begin the rare process of punishing a founding-member nation with penalties in the billions of euros. The argument has haunted Europe since the financial crisis of 2008, of which the consequences, including uneven recoveries and persistent economic inequality, continue to ripple through southern Europe. Italy's populists came to power in part by blaming Brussels for stifling their economy with strict budget rules. The budget from Rome is the first real, and not just rhetorical, assault on the establishment order of the bloc. The question is whether the budget is a serious stimulus plan or a bank-breaking populist giveaway larded with tax cuts, pension benefits and welfare programs that neither Italy nor the European Union can afford. A crash of the Italian economy, one of the largest in the bloc, could sink everyone. Doubts among investors have already caused an increase in the yields of 10-year government bonds — an indication that markets view Italy as a riskier country to lend to. But Italy's populists, who are holding more meetings today, appear unwilling to budge. The anti-immigrant League, led by Matteo Salvini, has sought tax cuts to please its business-friendly northern base. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement, led by Luigi Di Maio, is looking to rally support in the relatively poor south with a welfare program estimated to cost around $9 billion. Both parties are looking to consolidate before European Parliament elections in May, which are seen as a test of their power at home. ""If we had acceded to the budget they probably expected in Europe, we would not have protected the interests of the Italians,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said recently. The government's argument in favor of spending might be more persuasive if Italy's public debt were not already 131 percent of G.D.P. But it is precisely the combination of high debt and low growth — now about zero percent — that has left Italy struggling to find a way out of its economic dead end. Yet even some supporters of the expansive Italian spending are worried that the country's leaders are playing politics with the economy. ""It's schizophrenic,"" Gennaro Ferrillo, the director of a job center in Naples, said of the opposing policies in the budget. ""To put the two together is in complete contradiction. On the one hand, you have a tax break that reduces revenues, and on the other, you have increased spending to address the needs of the poor and those harmed by the crisis and austerity."" Mr. Ferrillo was speaking after the lone hour that the job center he runs on a dusty street on the outskirts of Naples opens in the afternoon. The Five Star Movement has envisioned registration at these centers — some of which lack internet connections — as a prerequisite for receiving its proposed ""citizens' income,"" essentially an unemployment benefit that would be worth about $875 a month for about six million struggling Italians. ""The help is necessary,"" Mr. Ferrillo said of the aid, ""to help people work, to keep them from being forced into the black market where they are exploited and completely lose their dignity."" But he said that he had seen no details of the plan and that a proposed, billion-dollar overhaul of the job centers would have to be carefully thought out if it was to be effective. ""Everyone is asking how will the government and Di Maio do this revolutionary measure for Italy,"" he said, adding that, ""it's practically impossible unless there is also a revolution in the centers."" The European Union does not appear convinced. Weeks ago, Brussels rejected Italy's proposed budget with instructions to cut a 2.4 percent of G.D.P. deficit spending level that is three times as large as the one offered by its predecessor. Mr. Salvini has opted for what he calls a flat tax, a proposed cut of 15 percent for small businesses and individuals making up to $73,000 a year, that is designed to please his base in the north, the country's industrial and economic heart. Along orderly streets lined with canals and handsome shops in the wealthy northern town of Treviso, a stronghold of the League, residents welcomed the proposed tax break. National, regional, provincial and city taxes, as well as those on utilities, can add up to about 65 percent in Italy, suffocating businesses. Even so, officials at the headquarters of Confartigianato, an association of Italian small businesses that have an average of about four employees, in the northeastern region of Veneto, expressed doubts about the seriousness of the government's proposals. In fact, they say, it is the combination of uncertainty, a lack of clarity in what the government is offering and a looming conflict with the European Union that is paralyzing small businesses. ""Day after day, the government changes its information,"" said Vendemiano Sartor, the president of the group's Treviso chapter. The group's policy shop has not started calculating the real impact of the tax proposal because there has not yet been a concrete proposal to study. This government, according to Agostino Bonomo, the association's president in Veneto, ""makes only electoral slogans and gives no clarity and has no vision for business."" The businesses ""are waiting,"" he said. ""They aren't moving."" Entrepreneurs, he added, feared a devaluation of Italy on the international markets that would hurt its reputation and lead to a drop in work orders from abroad. Increasingly, people in Veneto are moving their bank accounts to Austria, said the officials, who also expressed concern that the standoff with Brussels was more about stimulating frustrated voters than about improving the economy. Just as the north of Europe tends to resist paying for what it sees as fiscally undisciplined southern countries, the pro-business north of Italy, where joblessness is not an issue, does not want to pay for a huge expansion of welfare in the south, where youth unemployment can reach as high as 50 percent. ""What we're protesting is that we are spending money in this country to create a dependency culture,"" Mr. Sartor said. ""If the south drains resources, it's not that we can just say, 'Oh well.' It's 100 years like this!"" But the Five Star Movement campaigned explicitly on the promise of delivering that assistance, and its support ballooned in the south partly as a result. The economic realities that come with governing have forced the party to backtrack on some guarantees, such as its opposition to a gas pipeline in the southern region of Puglia that it campaigned against for years but now calls strategic. The so-called citizens' income, however, is now a critical element in its political identity. Killing time with other unemployed women perched on parked scooters, Filomena Palumbo lamented the lack of job prospects in the city for herself and for her adult children and their spouses, with whom she shared a small apartment in a crowded street up the hill. Her sons-in-law managed to ""get by,"" she said. ""They steal!"" her friend Giuseppina Iaccarino, 35, said with a laugh. Ms. Palumbo, a 38-year-old grandmother, shushed her friend but then conceded with a shrug: ""They can't even get by doing that anymore. There's not enough money going around. It's not worth going to jail for nothing,"" she said. She said she had voted for the Five Star Movement because she hoped that its promised relief program — which the party's leaders have sought to equate with the 1930s-era New Deal in the United States — would provide an alternative. ""The government has to get the money flowing,"" she said. Since taking office though, Five Star's popularity has shrunk while the League's has expanded. The League is applying pressure on Five Star to support a high-speed rail project through the Italian Alps to France. Mr. Di Maio, who has a record of flip-flopping, keeps getting outplayed by Mr. Salvini and is clearly desperate to deliver. But it is his welfare proposal that is driving deficit spending through the roof and attracting the censure from the European Union. In recent days, Mr. Di Maio has begun exploring the possibility of saving face by scaling back the welfare program, which critics say is merely an expanded version of the system put in place by the previous government that he excoriated. Some of the hundreds of people who turn up daily at the Naples job center have already started asking for the citizens' income even though it does not yet exist. On a recent afternoon, Daniele Peluso, 17, showed up looking for a job. Instead, he found a guard explaining to frustrated job seekers through a locked fence that the region had failed to update its website for its new operating hours. They were now 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., not 2:45 to 3:45. Crestfallen, Mr. Peluso turned away. His father, Luigi, 55, who had accompanied him, said he hoped the citizens' income would eventually help unemployed young southerners like his son. Daniele agreed, but added that he had some reservations if the job centers were to be involved in distributing the funds. He gestured to the guard and the locked gate. ""It's a bad start,"" he said."
News,2018-11-12,"Amid the recounts, recriminations and allegations of voter suppression or ballot fraud, something else happened in Tuesday’s elections — a wave of actions aimed at making voting easier and fairer that is an often-overlooked strain in the nation’s voting wars.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/voting-rights-turnout-gerrymandering.html,1493," Amid the recounts, recriminations and allegations of voter suppression or ballot fraud, something else happened in Tuesday's elections — a wave of actions aimed at making voting easier and fairer that is an often-overlooked strain in the nation's voting wars. Floridians extended voting rights to 1.4 million convicted felons. Maryland, Nevada and Michigan were among states that made it easier to register and vote. Michigan, along with Colorado and Missouri, limited politicians' ability to directly draw, and gerrymander, district lines. Utah, where votes are still being tallied, appears poised to do the same. It was as if states around the country were pulled in two directions at once — with measures aimed at broadening voter participation coming on the heels of recent laws and regulations making it harder to register and vote. Still, for all the charges and countercharges on voter suppression, most of the momentum Tuesday was on measures quite likely to broaden voter participation and limit gerrymanders. ""It is clear when you put democracy reforms on the ballot, those measures win overwhelmingly,"" Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, said. ""From our perspective, we are going to be taking a hard look at where we can move more of these reforms in 2020 and beyond."" There was plenty of news in the other direction, most notably the potential for prolonged legal fights over tight races in Florida, Georgia and Arizona. Many Americans cast ballots whose weight was diluted by precise, data-driven gerrymanders. North Carolina and Arkansas bucked this year's voter-friendly tide by creating new identification requirements. Sometimes, clashing electoral policies played out within the same state. While Floridians voted to re-enfranchise felons, college students there had to fend off a move by Florida's secretary of state to bar voting on campus. In Michigan, voters reinstated straight-ticket voting, which makes it easy to quickly vote for a single party across elections, overturning a move by the Republican-controlled legislature in 2015 to abolish it. Nationwide, the varying moves are the latest chapter in an escalating battle between Democrats, who tend to gain with a larger electorate, and Republicans, whose policies often push in the opposite direction. How Americans vote is likely to remain on the front burner as both parties turn toward the 2020 presidential year elections. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a backer of redistricting reform — he has a Terminate Gerrymandering PAC — said last week he will seek to build on recent gains and hold a summit on the topic. The election was also a reminder that, despite episodes of voter suppression, substantial progress is being made at increasing turnout, which was at the highest rate for a midterm in more than half a century. While the polarization and passion of the Trump era was likely the primary reason, the ease of early voting and automatic registration contributed. For the most part, the array of new ballot measures were aimed at continuing to make voting easier. That reflects the way voting issues combine both deeply political impulses and largely practical ones. ""There are voting reforms which trigger partisan sensibilities, and then there are those that respond to people's desire to have a modern, efficient and nonbureaucratic process,"" said Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford University law professor and elections scholar. ""People want options. They don't want to be forced to go to a polling place; they want to be able to vote from home. Right now, when people can conduct their entire lives on their phone, they wonder why they have to go to a 19th century polling place to cast a ballot."" Several of the measures sparked partisan battles, like Michigan's Proposal 2, which created a commission to draw district lines, and Issue 2 in Arkansas, which requires voters to have photo identification and was opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The A.C.L.U. also targeted Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and candidate for governor who became a villain among liberals after repeatedly making spurious claims about widespread voter fraud. While the A.C.L.U. does not officially endorse or oppose specific candidates, it made its feelings clear in Mr. Kobach's race, with a $400,000 TV ad buy, 150,000 mailers, 70,000 phone calls and by knocking on more than 5,000 doors. Mr. Kobach lost. ""When voters — actual people — get an opportunity to shape their election system, it's unequivocal where they are, but when it's politicians who are rendering judgment of the system, they are protecting the status quo and engineering outcomes to their advantage,"" Faiz Shakir, national political director of the A.C.L.U., said. ""The main lesson here is that we should go big and bold on voting rights."" The group was a central player in many of the progressive ballot measures, and it projected that, taken together, they will expand voting rights to two million people. Conservatives say that what Americans most want is an electorate in which everyone has been found to be eligible to vote. Donald Bryson, the chief executive of Civitas Institute, a Raleigh-based conservative policy group, said North Carolina voters backed the state's voter ID measure because it ""brings security to the electoral process."" Civitas has opposed steps like allowing voters to register on Election Day, as Maryland did. Mr. Bryson said same-day registration could ""make voters nervous about the integrity of the election, and that is something we should be wary of."" Some of the highest-profile initiatives were less partisan than one might expect. Republicans generally did not contest reinstating voting rights to Florida felons, even though demographics suggest the change is likely to favor Democrats. The Brennan Center called it ""the largest expansion of voting rights"" since the 26th Amendment lowered the voting age to 18 in 1971. The biggest financial backers of the Florida effort, by far, were the A.C.L.U. and one of the so-called ""dark money"" groups that have proliferated on both sides of the aisle. Combined, the A.C.L.U. and the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a left-leaning group, donated more than $9 million of the $10.2 million budget of the Floridians for a Fair Democracy, the group of former felons and family members that led the effort. While Florida Governor Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, the Republican candidates for Senate and governor, expressed measured opposition, many Republicans supported the measure. ""A significant number of folks voted straight red and pulled for the amendment,"" said Logan C. Churchwell, the communications and research director at the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a conservative group that wants states to aggressively cull their voter rolls. ""Some people interpret felon voting rights like any other question of redemption,"" he added in an email. ""Federalism at play here."" The effort was also endorsed by Freedom Partners, backed by the Koch brothers, conservative stalwarts; the group said that ""when individuals have served their sentences and paid their debts as ordered by a judge, they should be eligible to vote."" The A.C.L.U. and Freedom Partners even sent out a joint mailer. ""I'm not 180 degrees changing my position on the Koch brothers, but I did take note of it,"" said Miles Rapoport, a senior fellow at Harvard University and a Democrat who is the former secretary of state of Connecticut. ""It will transform Florida's politics."" Mr. Rapoport was encouraged both by the preponderance of progressive ballot measures and the shifting control in statehouses in some key states, like New York, where Democrats captured the State Senate, the only wing of the government they lacked, and North Carolina, where Republicans lost their supermajority. Unlike most states, New York does not allow early voting. ""There will be a lot of places to watch where there will be opportunities for further reform,"" Mr. Rapoport said. Officials in Colorado, which created two commissions to take over the task of drawing district lines, went even further in finding bipartisan compromise. Frank McNulty, the former Republican Speaker of the state's House of Representatives, said the political parties essentially called an armistice, setting aside their own ballot measures on redistricting. ""There was an agreement that there would be a laying down of arms,"" Mr. McNulty said. ""It was one of those things that we did to build trust."" Mark Grueskin, a prominent Colorado lawyer who was the lead negotiator for the Democrats, said ""each side has to have a serious motivating factor to be at the table."" He added: ""My sense is that the demographics of the voting populations in each state are going to determine how willing those states are to nurture the possibility of an open election process."" Some did not even get to vote on ballot measures that will change their lives. Neil Volz, the political director of the Floridians for a Fair Democracy, has a felony conviction related to the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. ""We were crying and hugging,"" Mr. Volz, a Republican, said of winning back his right to vote. ""We're fighting just as hard for people who want to vote for Donald Trump as we are for people who want to vote for Barack Obama."""
News,2018-11-12,You shouldn’t start a restaurant unless you know people like your cooking.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/your-money/how-to-reduce-risk-goals.html,408," You shouldn't start a restaurant unless you know people like your cooking. Sure, it's been your dream to own a restaurant since you were a kid. Perhaps you've finally saved enough to give yourself a running start. Your spouse and parents always tell you how great a cook you are. Every day you see another quote on social media about the need to seize the day. So it's time to take the next step, right? And that means mortgaging the house, maxing out the credit cards and going all in on a fancy spot. But wait. What if the restaurant fails? Or any big, risky thing you're tempted to try? Maybe there is a different way to pursue this dream. Yes, people who love you love your food. It's a reasonable guess that complete strangers will like it too. But don't forget, that's still a guess. Wouldn't it be worth testing that guess? 1. See if unbiased people like your cooking. Invite some acquaintances (preferably not your closest friends) over for dinner. Make them your best food, and watch what they do. Don't ask them if you should open a restaurant, just watch. Hopefully it goes well. If it does, that's valuable knowledge. Think of that knowledge as a tailwind. 2. See if people will pay for your food. Invite 10 or 12 more people over, suggest a menu and tell them it will cost them $25 per person, or $50. See how many show up. Gauge their reaction. If the dinner goes well, the tailwind just got stronger. So take the next step. 3. Rent a small space somewhere affordable. If the food is good, people will find it and put it on Instagram and Yelp. You don't need to sign the fanciest lease in the most happening area. Imagine achieving your dream without exercising the full nuclear option. What if you just took one small step at a time until you were forced — not by your untested hypothesis, but by market demand — to open a full-blown restaurant? Going all in is heroic. It makes for great television and social media. But when it fails, it's like the Titanic, and you and your family are left alone in the ocean among the sharks and icebergs wondering how you'll survive. Fortunately, there's another way. Make a guess, do the smallest test you can, learn from the results and repeat. That's how you de-risk a scary thing."
Obituary (Obit),2018-11-12,"If Stan Lee revolutionized the comic book world in the 1960s, which he did, he left as big a stamp — maybe bigger — on the even wider pop culture landscape of today.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/obituaries/stan-lee-dead.html,2497," If Stan Lee revolutionized the comic book world in the 1960s, which he did, he left as big a stamp — maybe bigger — on the even wider pop culture landscape of today. Think of ""Spider-Man,"" the blockbuster movie franchise and Broadway spectacle. Think of ""Iron Man,"" another Hollywood gold-mine series personified by its star, Robert Downey Jr. Think of ""Black Panther,"" the box-office superhero smash that shattered big screen racial barriers in the process. And that is to say nothing of the Hulk, the X-Men, Thor and other film and television juggernauts that have stirred the popular imagination and made many people very rich. If all that entertainment product can be traced to one person, it would be Stan Lee, who died in Los Angeles on Monday at 95. From a cluttered office on Madison Avenue in Manhattan in the 1960s, he helped conjure a lineup of pulp-fiction heroes that has come to define much of popular culture in the early 21st century. Mr. Lee was a central player in the creation of those characters and more, all properties of Marvel Comics. Indeed, he was for many the embodiment of Marvel, if not comic books in general, overseeing the company's emergence as an international media behemoth. A writer, editor, publisher, Hollywood executive and tireless promoter (of Marvel and of himself), he played a critical role in what comics fans call the medium's silver age. Many believe that Marvel, under his leadership and infused with his colorful voice, crystallized that era, one of exploding sales, increasingly complex characters and stories, and growing cultural legitimacy for the medium. (Marvel's chief competitor at the time, National Periodical Publications, now known as DC — the home of Superman and Batman, among other characters — augured this period, with its 1956 update of its superhero the Flash, but did not define it.) Under Mr. Lee, Marvel transformed the comic book world by imbuing its characters with the self-doubts and neuroses of average people, as well an awareness of trends and social causes and, often, a sense of humor. In humanizing his heroes, giving them character flaws and insecurities that belied their supernatural strengths, Mr. Lee tried ""to make them real flesh-and-blood characters with personality,"" he told The Washington Post in 1992. ""That's what any story should have, but comics didn't have until that point,"" he said. ""They were all cardboard figures.""  12 Photos View Slide Show › Energetic, gregarious, optimistic and alternately grandiose and self-effacing, Mr. Lee was an effective salesman, employing a Barnumesque syntax in print (""Face front, true believer!"" ""Make mine Marvel!"") to market Marvel's products to a rabid following. He charmed readers with jokey, conspiratorial comments and asterisked asides in narrative panels, often referring them to previous issues. In 2003 he told The Los Angeles Times, ""I wanted the reader to feel we were all friends, that we were sharing some private fun that the outside world wasn't aware of."" Though Mr. Lee was often criticized for his role in denying rights and royalties to his artistic collaborators , his involvement in the conception of many of Marvel's best-known characters is indisputable. He was born Stanley Martin Lieber on Dec. 28, 1922, in Manhattan, the older of two sons born to Jack Lieber, an occasionally employed dress cutter, and Celia (Solomon) Lieber, both immigrants from Romania. The family moved to the Bronx. Stanley began reading Shakespeare at 10 while also devouring pulp magazines, the novels of Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Rice Burroughs and Mark Twain, and the swashbuckler movies of Errol Flynn. He graduated at 17 from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and aspired to be a writer of serious literature. He was set on the path to becoming a different kind of writer when, after a few false starts at other jobs, he was hired at Timely Publications, a company owned by Martin Goodman, a relative who had made his name in pulp magazines and was entering the comics field. Mr. Lee was initially paid $8 a week as an office gofer. Eventually he was writing and editing stories, many in the superhero genre. At Timely he worked with the artist Jack Kirby (1917-94), who, with a writing partner, Joe Simon, had created the hit character Captain America, and who would eventually play a vital role in Mr. Lee's career. When Mr. Simon and Mr. Kirby, Timely's hottest stars, were lured away by a rival company, Mr. Lee was appointed chief editor. As a writer, Mr. Lee could be startlingly prolific. ""Almost everything I've ever written I could finish at one sitting,"" he once said. ""I'm a fast writer. Maybe not the best, but the fastest."" Mr. Lee used several pseudonyms to give the impression that Marvel had a large stable of writers; the name that stuck was simply his first name split in two. (In the 1970s, he legally changed Lieber to Lee.) During World War II, Mr. Lee wrote training manuals stateside in the Army Signal Corps while moonlighting as a comics writer. In 1947, he married Joan Boocock, a former model who had moved to New York from her native England. His daughter Joan Celia Lee, who is known as J. C., was born in 1950; another daughter, Jan, died three days after birth in 1953. Mr. Lee's wife died in 2017. A lawyer for Ms. Lee, Kirk Schenck, confirmed Mr. Lee's death, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his younger brother, Larry Lieber, who drew the ""Amazing Spider-Man"" syndicated newspaper strip for years. In the mid-1940s, the peak of the golden age of comic books, sales boomed. But later, as plots and characters turned increasingly lurid (especially at EC, a Marvel competitor that published titles like Tales From the Crypt and The Vault of Horror), many adults clamored for censorship. In 1954, a Senate subcommittee led by the Tennessee Democrat Estes Kefauver held hearings investigating allegations that comics promoted immorality and juvenile delinquency. Feeding the senator's crusade was the psychiatrist Fredric Wertham's 1954 anti-comics jeremiad, ""Seduction of the Innocent."" Among other claims, the book contended that DC's ""Batman stories"" — featuring the team of Batman and Robin — were ""psychologically homosexual."" Choosing to police itself rather than accept legislation, the comics industry established the Comics Code Authority to ensure wholesome content. Gore and moral ambiguity were out, but so largely were wit, literary influences and attention to social issues. Innocuous cookie-cutter exercises in genre were in. Many found the sanitized comics boring, and — with the new medium of television providing competition — readership, which at one point had reached 600 million sales annually, declined by almost three-quarters within a few years. With the dimming of superhero comics' golden age, Mr. Lee tired of grinding out generic humor, romance, western and monster stories for what had by then become Atlas Comics. Reaching a career impasse in his 30s, he was encouraged by his wife to write the comics he wanted to, not merely what was considered marketable. And Mr. Goodman, his boss, spurred by the popularity of a rebooted Flash (and later Green Lantern) at DC, wanted him to revisit superheroes. Mr. Lee took Mr. Goodman up on his suggestion, but he carried its implications much further. In 1961, Mr. Lee and Mr. Kirby — whom he had brought back years before to the company, now known as Marvel — produced the first issue of The Fantastic Four, about a superpowered team with humanizing dimensions: nonsecret identities, internal squabbles and, in the orange-rock-skinned Thing, self-torment. It was a hit. Other Marvel titles — like the Lee-Kirby creation The Incredible Hulk, a modern Jekyll-and-Hyde story about a decent man transformed by radiation into a monster — offered a similar template. The quintessential Lee hero, introduced in 1962 and created with the artist Steve Ditko (1927-2018), was Spider-Man. A timid high school intellectual who gained his powers when bitten by a radioactive spider, Spider-Man was prone to soul-searching, leavened with wisecracks — a key to the character's lasting popularity across multiple entertainment platforms, including movies and a Broadway musical. Mr. Lee's dialogue encompassed Catskills shtick, like Spider-Man's patter in battle; Elizabethan idioms, like Thor's; and working-class Lower East Side swagger, like the Thing's. It could also include dime-store poetry, as in this eco-oratory about humans, uttered by the Silver Surfer, a space alien: ""And yet — in their uncontrollable insanity — in their unforgivable blindness — they seek to destroy this shining jewel — this softly spinning gem — this tiny blessed sphere — which men call Earth!"" Mr. Lee practiced what he called the Marvel method: Instead of handing artists scripts to illustrate, he summarized stories and let the artists draw them and fill in plot details as they chose. He then added sound effects and dialogue. Sometimes he would discover on penciled pages that new characters had been added to the narrative. Such surprises (like the Silver Surfer, a Kirby creation and a Lee favorite) would lead to questions of character ownership. Mr. Lee was often faulted for not adequately acknowledging the contributions of his illustrators, especially Mr. Kirby. Spider-Man became Marvel's best-known property, but Mr. Ditko, its co-creator, quit Marvel in bitterness in 1966. Mr. Kirby, who visually designed countless characters, left in 1969. Though he reunited with Mr. Lee for a Silver Surfer graphic novel in 1978, their heyday had ended. Many comic fans believe that Mr. Kirby was wrongly deprived of royalties and original artwork in his lifetime, and for years the Kirby estate sought to acquire rights to characters that Mr. Kirby and Mr. Lee had created together. Mr. Kirby's heirs were long rebuffed in court on the grounds that he had done ""work for hire"" — in other words, that he had essentially sold his art without expecting royalties. In September 2014, Marvel and the Kirby estate reached a settlement. Mr. Lee and Mr. Kirby now both receive credit on numerous screen productions based on their work. Mr. Lee moved to Los Angeles in 1980 to develop Marvel properties, but most of his attempts at live-action television and movies were disappointing. (The series ""The Incredible Hulk,"" seen on CBS from 1978 to 1982, was an exception.) Avi Arad, an executive at Toy Biz, a company in which Marvel had bought a controlling interest, began to revive the company's Hollywood fortunes, particularly with an animated ""X-Men"" series on Fox, which ran from 1992 to 1997. (Its success helped pave the way for the live-action big-screen ""X-Men"" franchise, which has flourished since its first installment, in 2000.) In the late 1990s, Mr. Lee was named chairman emeritus at Marvel and began to explore outside projects. While his personal appearances (including charging fans $120 for an autograph) were one source of income, later attempts to create wholly owned superhero properties foundered. Stan Lee Media, a digital content start-up, crashed in 2000 and landed his business partner, Peter F. Paul, in prison for securities fraud. (Mr. Lee was never charged.) In 2001, Mr. Lee started POW! Entertainment (the initials stand for ""purveyors of wonder""), but he received almost no income from Marvel movies and TV series until he won a court fight with Marvel Enterprises in 2005, leading to an undisclosed settlement costing Marvel $10 million. In 2009, the Walt Disney Company, which had agreed to pay $4 billion to acquire Marvel, announced that it had paid $2.5 million to increase its stake in POW! In Mr. Lee's final years, after the death of his wife, the circumstances of his business affairs and contentious financial relationship with his surviving daughter attracted attention in the news media. In 2018, Mr. Lee was embroiled in disputes with POW!, and The Daily Beast and The Hollywood Reporter ran accounts of fierce infighting among Mr. Lee's daughter, household staff and business advisers. The Hollywood Reporter claimed ""elder abuse."" In February 2018, Mr. Lee signed a notarized document declaring that three men — a lawyer, a caretaker of Mr. Lee's and a dealer in memorabilia — had ""insinuated themselves into relationships with J. C. for an ulterior motive and purpose,"" to ""gain control over my assets, property and money."" He later withdrew his claim, but longtime aides of his — an assistant, an accountant and a housekeeper — were either dismissed or greatly limited in their contact with him. In a profile in The New York Times in April, a cheerful Mr. Lee said, ""I'm the luckiest guy in the world,"" adding that ""my daughter has been a great help to me"" and that ""life is pretty good"" — although he admitted in that same interview, ""I've been very careless with money."" Marvel movies, however, have proved a cash cow for major studios, if not so much for Mr. Lee. With the blockbuster ""Spider-Man"" in 2002, Marvel superhero films hit their stride. Such movies (including franchises starring Iron Man, Thor and the superhero team the Avengers, to name but three) together had grossed more than $24 billion worldwide as of April. ""Black Panther,"" the first Marvel movie directed by an African-American (Ryan Coogler) and starring an almost all-black cast, took in about $201.8 million domestically when it opened over the four-day Presidents' Day weekend this year, the fifth-biggest opening of all time. Many other film properties are in development, in addition to sequels in established franchises. Characters Mr. Lee had a hand in creating now enjoy a degree of cultural penetration they have never had before. Mr. Lee wrote a slim memoir, ""Excelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee,"" with George Mair, published in 2002. His 2015 book, ""Amazing Fantastic Incredible: A Marvelous Memoir"" (written with Peter David and illustrated in comic-book form by Colleen Doran), pays abundant credit to the artists many fans believed he had shortchanged years before. Recent Marvel films and TV shows have also often credited Mr. Lee's former collaborators; Mr. Lee himself has almost always received an executive producer credit. His cameo appearances in them became something of a tradition. (Even ""Teen Titans Go! to the Movies,"" an animated feature in 2018 about a DC superteam, had more than one Lee cameo.) TV shows bearing his name or presence have included the reality series ""Stan Lee's Superhumans"" and the competition show ""Who Wants to Be a Superhero?"" Mr. Lee's unwavering energy suggested that he possessed superpowers himself. (In his 90s he had a Twitter account, @TheRealStanlee.) And the National Endowment for the Arts acknowledged as much when it awarded him a National Medal of Arts in 2008. But he was frustrated, like all humans, by mortality. ""I want to do more movies, I want to do more television, more DVDs, more multi-sodes, I want to do more lecturing, I want to do more of everything I'm doing,"" he said in ""With Great Power …: The Stan Lee Story,"" a 2010 television documentary. ""The only problem is time. I just wish there were more time."""
News,2018-11-12,A settlement announced Monday between the N.H.L. and several hundred retired hockey players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of repeated head hits did little to quell the emotional intensity surrounding the issue.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/sports/hockey/hockey-concussion-settlement.html,997," A settlement announced Monday between the N.H.L. and several hundred retired hockey players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of repeated head hits did little to quell the emotional intensity surrounding the issue. The deal, which must be approved by the 318 former players who joined the lawsuit, includes free neuropsychological tests, up to $75,000 for medical treatment, a potential cash payment of about $20,000 a player, and the establishment of a Common Good Fund to help other players in need. The settlement will undoubtedly bring a trickle of money to players in need and is a minor legal achievement, given the resources and resolve of the N.H.L., which used brass knuckles to fight the players at every turn. But few on the plaintiff side will be happy with a deal that provides little long-term security for retired players who are suffering. ""The N.H.L.'s philosophy was scorched earth and deny every issue,"" said Charles Zimmerman, the lead lawyer for the retired hockey players. ""They denied the link between neurocognitive problems and the game of hockey, and felt that the players were not injured and wouldn't participate in large numbers. They were right on that."" After four years of litigation, the N.H.L. knew that far fewer former hockey players, many of them Canadians, were willing to take on a sport that is all but a national religion in Canada, a country with a less litigious tradition than the United States. Fighting a sport synonymous with Canadian toughness and freezing afternoons on frozen ponds goes against the grain with many people above the 49th parallel. Hockey, Zimmerman said, is ""a very different culture"" than football and the N.F.L. He said, ""We had a different game, a different league, a different culture and different commissioners."" The agreement, fairly or not, will be forever compared to the settlement in the N.F.L., which agreed to a far more sweeping settlement in 2013. That deal covers every retired football player, not just those who sued the league, like the N.H.L.'s. All players can get medical tests, but also cash payments of up to $5 million if they have or develop A.L.S., dementia or other cognitive and neurological conditions. The N.F.L. settlement has been plagued with delays and accusations of fraud, and it has more than a few flaws, including covering only a limited number of players who are found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits. But the N.F.L. settlement is more inclusive than the deal the former hockey players struck because the N.F.L. wanted to end potential lawsuits that might have cited evidence already unearthed, like internal league committees that created junk science to discredit those claiming the game was dangerous. In the end, the league agreed to an estimated $1 billion settlement without a single player being deposed or appearing in court. There were different legal realities, too. In the N.F.L. case, hundreds of civil actions that about 5,000 players brought were consolidated in the United States District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania. The N.F.L. actively supported that move, and the judge overseeing the case, Anita B. Brody, appointed a well-known mediator to bring the sides together. Just four months after oral arguments in April 2013, an initial deal was announced covering all 20,000 or so retired players. The former hockey players, meanwhile, won several early decisions in court, but the N.H.L. opposed the creation of a class that would include many more former players. On July 13, Susan Nelson, the judge overseeing the case in United States District Court in St. Paul, denied the former players' bid to attain class-action status. That would have made it easier for thousands of other players to join the suit. Instead, the decision effectively limited the size of the group of players suing the league, diluting their leverage. In her decision, Nelson wrote that managing the case as a class-action lawsuit would prove too difficult given that different states had different rules about the medical monitoring the players were seeking. With the scales tilted toward the league, negotiations, which were largely stalled, advanced. ""We gave it a hell of a shot,"" Zimmerman said. Some sports lawyers say that Zimmerman and the other lawyers involved got the best deal they could under the circumstances. ""The N.H.L. case makes the N.F.L. settlement look like a grand slam times 10,"" said Paul Anderson, a sports lawyer in Kansas City, Mo. ""But the facts in the N.F.L. case were far more egregious, the total number of players at the N.F.L. level was larger, and there was nonstop media reporting about it."" Norman O'Reilly, who teaches sports business at the University of Guelph in Ontario, added that the N.H.L. had the good fortune of facing a more fractured opponent: former players not just from Canada and the United States, but also Europe. He also said player resentment of the league was not as virulent in the N.H.L., partly because player contracts are guaranteed. Yet, given the scale of injuries that former hockey players are dealing with, Zimmerman said he was surprised the N.H.L. did not appear more willing to help some of the men who helped make the league and the owners wealthy. On Monday, the fans will have their chance to say whether they think the league should have done more. That's when Commissioner Gary Bettman, a former litigator who played hardball with the retired players, will be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in a ceremony in Toronto. Bettman is regularly booed when he presents the Stanley Cup to the winning team each June. He has never given an inch when it comes to acknowledging that high-speed collisions and bare-knuckle fistfights might cause long-term brain damage. The settlement his league has agreed to seems sure to protect the financial well-being of the owners. It's unlikely to win Bettman much in the way of praise from anyone who advocates the long-term health and well-being of hockey players."
News,2018-11-13,"SYDNEY, Australia — Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia was blindsided by reports that a state government had quietly sidestepped federal regulators and signed a deal with China to participate in that country’s contentious Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/world/australia/victoria-china-scott-morrison.html,986," SYDNEY, Australia — Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia was blindsided by reports that a state government had quietly sidestepped federal regulators and signed a deal with China to participate in that country's contentious Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.  Mr. Morrison said this week that the agreement, signed last month between the governments of China and the state of Victoria, undermined the federal government's ability to conduct foreign policy at a time when intelligence officials are concerned that China is trying to exert undue influence in Australia.  Mr. Morrison told reporters he was ""surprised"" that the Victorian government would involve itself in a ""matter of international relations"" without discussing it first. ""They know full well our policy on those issues and I thought that was not a very cooperative or helpful way to do things on such issues,"" Mr. Morrison said.  Daniel Andrews, the premier of Victoria, said the deal would bring his state's businesses ""one step closer to unlocking the trade and investment opportunities of China's ambitious Belt and Road initiative."" Critics, however, have characterized Mr. Andrews as naïve for failing to understand how China has used the initiative to deepen its global influence by promising to help construct grand infrastructure projects.  Others have said Mr. Andrews cut a deal with China for politically opportunistic reasons: His state government goes to the polls in less than two weeks. Whatever his motivations, the deal sets a precedent for China to sidestep national leaders in Canberra and court states individually. ""I think this is a big part of Beijing's agenda, to say to other states and territories that being the last to sign up will be bad,"" said Michael Shoebridge, director of the defense and strategy program at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. ""That would be consistent with Beijing's approach with other negotiations internationally.""  It remains unclear exactly what the deal in Victoria will cover, but the Belt and Road projects in other countries have tended to be large in scale. Under President Xi Jinping, China has pledged trillions of dollars over the past five years toward the construction of roads, power plants and ports throughout Asia, Africa and Europe. The Belt and Road initiative, a key foreign policy of Mr. Xi's government, uses big infrastructure projects as way to win friends and spread influence. But the money often comes with strings attached. Chinese government-controlled lenders offer sizable amounts of money through loans or financial guarantees to build airports, seaports, highways, rail lines and power plants.  That money often comes with the requirement that Chinese companies be heavily involved in planning and construction, and Chinese employees are often brought in for the work, minimizing the immediate economic benefits to the country hosting the project. Pakistan has accepted billions of dollars in loans from China in recent years for infrastructure projects, the terms of which remain largely undisclosed. China has pledged a total of more than $60 billion to Pakistan in the form of loans and investments for roads, ports, power plants and industrial parks. But now Pakistan is seeking an emergency bailout loan of $8 billion from the International Monetary Fund, along with new loans from Saudi Arabia and China.  Sri Lanka, in debt over a port that was never viable, renegotiated the terms of its contract with China to repay billions for the investment and ended up signing the port over to Beijing under a 99-year lease. The deal last December crystallized international criticism depicting the Belt and Road Initiative as a debt trap for vulnerable countries. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia recently canceled two major Chinese-linked projects, greenlighted by his since-ousted predecessor, that were worth more than $22 billion.  Australia has long had to balance its economic relationship with China against its strategic security alliance with the United States. Ever since John Howard was prime minister more than a decade ago, Canberra has tried to keep both powers happy. ""Howard famously argued that Australia didn't have to choose between its economic relations with China and the alliance with the United States,"" said Michael Clarke, an associate professor at the National Security College at Australian National University. ""Clearly, both of those assumptions no longer hold with President Trump's 'America First' approach and China's assertiveness under President Xi Jinping,"" Mr. Clarke said.  The federal government, Mr. Clarke said, needs to clarify its position on whether Australian states are allowed to receive funding for Belt and Road projects. Canberra may object to Victoria's decision to sign on to the initiative, but the federal government has also signed a memorandum of understanding with China, which it, too, has kept largely under wraps. In September, Steven Ciobo, then the trade minister, signed an agreement that would allow Australia and China to cooperate on infrastructure projects in third countries under the Belt and Road Initiative. The federal government has yet to make the details of that agreement public.  The Victorian government initially refused to divulge the contents of the deal it had signed with Beijing. On Monday, however, it published a four-page document online.  ""It says something about the culture of government and its distrust toward public transparency that both the federal and state governments chose not to disclose their MOUs,"" said Euan Graham, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute, a think tank. ""And there is a broader point here about how the government conducts its business."" The reaction from other politicians — the opposition leader Bill Shorten has said he supports Victoria's deal — and their attempts to use the news for partisan politicking have created even more fissures for China to exploit, Mr. Graham said. ""What the government needs to focus on is what's good policy,"" he said. ""Good policy toward China means a joined-up approach, and anything that allows those divides to be exposed is going to result in bad policy outcomes that China can at the very least rhetorically cash in on.""

News,2018-11-13,"Real estate titans have long scoffed at WeWork, which in eight short years has managed to attain a $20 billion valuation by selling short-term leases for shared office space with a mixture of stylish design and free-flowing alcohol. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/business/dealbook/wework-office-space-real-estate.html,1019," Real estate titans have long scoffed at WeWork, which in eight short years has managed to attain a $20 billion valuation by selling short-term leases for shared office space with a mixture of stylish design and free-flowing alcohol.  Derided by some as a real estate company masquerading as a technology company, it has been called everything from a ""$20 billion house of cards"" to a ""Ponzi scheme.""  The naysayers argue that WeWork's business model looks brilliant only in a rising economy that has allowed it to lock in long-term leases and then re-rent that space to other businesses at a premium. The enormous valuation it has obtained is higher than that of Boston Properties and Vornado, two of the country's biggest office-space landlords — companies that actually own the kind of space that WeWork usually rents. Now, with interest rates creeping higher, residential real estate prices flattening and fears of an economic slowdown coming, real estate insiders are gleeful at the notion that a downturn could be an existential threat for the company. But a funny thing happened as WeWork has scaled up all over the globe: It may have become too big to fail. WeWork has gobbled up leases for so much space in so many cities, there's a compelling case to be made that its landlords wouldn't be able to afford for it to go under. Because of WeWork's size, ""they have more power in a down market,"" said Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the longtime real estate investor and founder of Colony Capital.  The company is scheduled to release third-quarter financial results on Tuesday. A WeWork spokesman, citing the coming report, declined to comment.  [WeWork reported that it lost $1.22 billion through the first nine months of the year — but the company also said an additional $3 billion investment from SoftBank had pushed its valuation to at least $42 billion.] The conventional wisdom is that when the economy turns south, WeWork's customers — many of which are start-ups and may be the most vulnerable — will simply walk away. The flexibility of WeWork's short-term leases is part of its appeal, after all.  Such a situation would leave the company stuck with long-term leases, few clients and little income. It's the same one that faced Regus, an office sharing company that filed for bankruptcy protection after the dot-com bust. And even as WeWork has grown, it has burned through considerable cash: It lost more than $700 million in the first half of 2018. Even those who are bullish on WeWork count changing economic conditions among the dangers it faces. ""While the company's flexible contracts may be ideal for small companies, WeWork would inevitably face trouble leasing their spaces if start-ups began to dry up or if the real estate market experiences a downturn similar to the 2008 financial crisis,"" the research firm CB Insights wrote as it articulated the criticisms of WeWork in an otherwise upbeat case for the company's sky-high valuation. But WeWork has been building a more durable business than most real estate executives seem to appreciate. The company was once marketed to individuals and small businesses on month-to-month lease agreements, but large companies like IBM and Microsoft are now using it and signing significantly longer leases. The company says its average customer has a lease of seven to eight months and new customers are signing leases that average 20 months. Underneath all the branding and wide-ranging aspirations — which include a for-profit elementary school called WeGrow — it's still a real estate company.  ""At the end of the day, it is about leasing space,"" Mr. Barrack said. And WeWork has leased a lot of it. The company has said it is the largest real estate tenant in New York, London and Washington. It ranks in the top five in many other major cities. In New York alone, WeWork controls three million square feet of commercial real estate; it controls 15.5 million square feet globally with 335 locations in 24 countries. WeWork projects to have about 400,000 individuals using its office space by the end of the year, which would put it ahead of the entire employee base of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway — one of the largest employers in the nation. Another sign of just how large WeWork's ecosystem has become: It employs 1,300 people in architecture, interior design, engineering and related activities — an employee roster that would make it one of the biggest architecture firms in the world.  That means when the next economic downturn comes — and it will — WeWork's landlords will actually be less likely to evict the company if it doesn't pay its rent. If they were to let WeWork fail, those landlords would risk depressing commercial real state prices to such a degree that it would create a serious sense of pain for the country's largest real estate owners. More likely, landlords would swallow hard and renegotiate the lease agreements on more favorable terms to keep WeWork from creating a full-on panic. The idea of ""too big to fail"" has long applied to banks and whether the government would come to the rescue to prop them up, but in this case, landlords all over the world might find themselves in the uncomfortable position of having to help save a failing tenant simply because the tenant is so large. That isn't necessarily the only solution if WeWork were to end up unable to pay its rent.  Rather than kick out WeWork or lower its rent, a landlord could have the company act as a property manager. A big part of WeWork's value proposition is in its management of properties. It's possible that WeWork could become the equivalent of Marriott, which manages hotels but doesn't own or lease them.  WeWork also has a cushion that most real estate companies don't: SoftBank. The Japanese investor has already plowed $4.4 billion into the company and just last month discussed taking a majority stake. Given SoftBank's deep pockets — it has a $100 billion fund aimed at start-ups — it is quite possible that WeWork could weather financial difficulties without any help from its landlords. When the next downturn comes, we'll find out who was right: real estate traditionalists, or the ones trying to upend them."

Denise and Michael Hunter typically come here for a quiet cuppa with the volunteers, a square meal and sometimes a food parcel or two. But on this day, the Hunters had a surprising tea date: the United Nations special rapporteur for extreme poverty and human rights,  Philip Alston, his four assistants, two television cameras, a dozen journalists and the local priest. ""It's a bit different to how it usually is,"" said Ms. Hunter, 57, her face beaming. ""It's like we're royalty or something."" It was Day 3 of Mr. Alston's two-week tour of the world's fifth-richest country — a hectic 2,000-mile mission across some of the poorest districts in Britain. He is visiting food banks, job centers, community charities and government ministries in London, Oxford, Cardiff, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast and Essex — as well as here in Newcastle — to assess why about a fifth of Britons remain in poverty despite rising employment levels, economic growth and pockets of enormous wealth. 100 miles Scotland Edinburgh Glasgow N. Ireland Newcastle Belfast Britain Ireland England Wales Essex Oxford Cardiff London Bristol By The New York Times Many might be as surprised by his presence as the Hunter family was, or the reporters struggling to keep up with him as he rushed between as many as five meetings a day, often without pausing for lunch or supper. Special rapporteurs for extreme poverty are mandated to visit and investigate countries with high levels of deprivation and then report their findings to the United Nations. They have historically spent most of their time in the developing world, and Mr. Alston's trip to Britain is only the second mission to a Western European country by a poverty rapporteur this century, the other being to Ireland in 2011. The rapporteur has also visited the United States twice since 2000. ""There's an oddity to this, obviously,"" said  David Gordon, director of the Townsend Center for International Poverty Research at the University of Bristol, who met Mr. Alston on the second day of his tour. ""When you think of the special rapporteurs on extreme poverty and human rights, you expect them to be visiting sub-Saharan Africa or Haiti. You don't expect them to be visiting the U.K."" Yet for Mr. Alston, Britain in 2018 is an obvious place to focus his energy, and not just because child poverty and food bank usage are on the rise here. Having pioneered the welfare state in the late 1940s and the privatization of the state in the 1980s, Britain in the 2010s has become the world's main laboratory for the politics of austerity. In response to the 2008 financial crisis, few governing parties have pared back the state for so long, and with such ideological glee, as the ruling Conservative Party in Britain. ""The U.K. was a world leader in social security after World War II, it was a world leader on privatization on a large scale and it is a world leader right now in self-imposed austerity,"" Mr. Alston said in an interview during a rare pause in his schedule, aboard a train in northeast England. ""And so it is an important case study to better understand the implications of an austerity approach."" Since 2010, the government has set in motion more than $39 billion of cuts, freezing or reducing welfare payments and housing subsidies for families and disabled people and cutting back youth and children's services, as well as funding for local authorities. Bungled technical reforms have also delayed payments to struggling families, forcing thousands into unnecessary debt and rent arrears. Here at the Newcastle West End food bank, a one-story building where staff members hand out nearly 300 food parcels a week, local residents were queuing up to tell Mr. Alston how they had been failed by the reforms. One of them was Denise Hunter. Until a year ago, she and her husband had been getting by, living off the money her husband made from painting toy figurines. Then he fell seriously ill, forcing the couple to apply for welfare payments. But because of widely documented problems with the Conservatives' new welfare system, known as Universal Credit, the Hunters' predicament has worsened. Almost all new Universal Credit recipients must wait around six weeks to receive their first payment, forcing those without savings into debt. The Hunters were no exception. With no income, the Hunters immediately went into rent arrears, unable to pay for electricity, food and heating. Only the generosity of their landlord prevents their eviction now, and only the existence of the food bank keeps them fed. ""We wouldn't be able to survive without the food bank,"" Ms. Hunter said. To avoid further cuts to their payments, Ms. Hunter must regularly provide the government with online updates about what she is doing to find work. But because she cannot afford a mobile phone or regular home internet, she can sometimes only do this at the city's main library. And since she cannot afford the bus fare, she must walk three miles to get there — a lengthy round trip that hinders her search for work. Libraries closer to home have either closed or had their hours and services scaled back, because of government cuts. Hospitalized with a heart condition in March and unable to update her online account, Ms. Hunter had her payments suspended for three further months, forcing her further into debt, she said. ""It's terrible,"" Ms. Hunter said. ""You don't know which way to turn."" Ms. Hunter's situation is far from unique, staff members at the food bank said. The demand for their food parcels has increased by a fifth in the past six months. Nationally, the number of food parcels distributed by the Trussell Trust, Britain's largest food bank network, grew to more than 650,000 during the summer of 2018, nearly double the 350,000 distributed during the summer of 2013. An hour later, across town at the central library, Mr. Alston hurried into another round-table discussion about the reasons for this rise. At the discussion was Thushara Chandrasiri, 35, who started receiving benefits in 2011 because of a disabled right arm. But this year, the government reassessed Mr. Chandrasiri and said his disability was not as serious as they had previously judged, cutting his monthly welfare payments by just over $500. A case worker said he ""should be used to it by now,"" Mr. Chandrasiri remembered being told. ""You've got a left hand as well."" Next to him sat Tracey Whitenstall, 41, a single parent of three, whose life was upended when her family was transferred to the new welfare system. Because of an administrative error, the family's payments were delayed by 10 weeks, shoving them into debt. For several weeks, Ms. Whitenstall's teenage son stopped attending school because she could no longer afford his bus fare. He is among 600,000 children who have fallen into poverty since the start of the Conservatives' reforms, a trend that is projected to continue by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent analysis firm. The looming impact of Britain's departure from the European Union, scheduled for March 2019, is also likely to worsen the situation, according to an alliance of children's rights groups. With the welfare changes, families on benefits are now an average of $2,700 worse off, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group, an independent watchdog. And while unemployment has more than halved under the Conservatives, wages have stagnated and the number of working families in poverty has risen. Yet, poverty is a complex and contested subject in Britain, where there are several contrasting measures of deprivation, and some observers were skeptical about the necessity of Mr. Alston's visit. While child poverty has risen markedly in recent years, overall poverty levels have remained fairly steady or even dropped slightly — partly because of sharp falls in pensioner poverty since the 1980s. Though 1,550,000 were classed in 2017 as destitute, or experiencing extreme poverty, by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a poverty research group, that figure was a quarter less than in 2015. If Mr. Alston ends up linking poverty to the government's benefit policies, ""he would just be adding more noise,"" said Edward Davies, director of policy at the Center for Social Justice, a think tank founded by Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative minister who spearheaded the reforms. ""My fear is that we have a debate about welfare reform in this country, and he could get embroiled in that."" Commenting on Mr. Alston's visit in a written statement, a government spokesman said that child and overall poverty rates had fallen since the Conservatives entered office — using a different measure from the one preferred by poverty researchers at the Rowntree Foundation and the Child Poverty Action Group. Mr. Alston said he was keeping an open mind. In several meetings in Newcastle, he avoided asking leading questions and frequently played devil's advocate to people seeking to blame the government. As his train thundered north into Scotland that night, Mr. Alston said he would draw no conclusions until releasing his preliminary findings on Friday. ""It's been said to me, 'Come on, you must have had a draft before you came here,' "" Mr. Alston said. ""But on every mission I've always found myself asking after a few days, 'What the hell am I going to say?' """
News,2018-11-13,Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/business/dealbook/ge-larry-culp.html,415," Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Larry Culp is only six weeks into his job as the head of General Electric, but he has already fallen into a familiar pattern. The chief executive of the $70 billion conglomerate said on Monday that he was looking to accelerate asset sales to reduce the company's debt. But other problems, like G.E.'s troubled power business, still aren't close to being solved. Mr. Culp may have been trying to stop G.E.'s share price slide; instead he exacerbated it. Mr. Culp's sudden appointment last month as the first outsider to lead the conglomerate in its 126-year history looked a lot like what G.E. needed. His record building up the conglomerate Danaher between 2000 and 2014 suggested that he could provide fresh thinking. G.E.'s woes go back decades, though, including determined expansion into financial services and former boss Jeff Immelt's $11 billion purchase of France's Alstom in 2015, just as demand for gas-fired electricity-generating turbines peaked. Unwinding those problems will take time. Mr. Culp could use some early wins, but there might not be any. Selling G.E.'s 62.5 percent stake in the oil-services company Baker Hughes sounds fairly straightforward. But the recent weakness in oil prices and disappointing third-quarter earnings have knocked a quarter off its market value since June, including a small decline after Mr. Culp's comments on Monday. G.E.'s health care business, which is also on the chopping block, continues to grow revenue at a single-digit percent rate, but arranging an initial public offering, which Mr. Culp hinted at Monday, could take the better part of a year. All of which suggests that it will take time to whittle down the $46.3 billion of debt attached to G.E.'s industrial businesses. The company's operations consumed more cash than they generated in the first nine months of this year, and executives acknowledge that they are likely to miss net debt reduction targets set by Mr. Culp's immediate predecessor John Flannery. Under its previous bosses, G.E. demolished its credibility with investors by repeatedly missing targets and failing to draw a clear line under its problems. Mr. Culp, who has already overseen a $22 billion write-down of G.E.'s accounting good will, should be wary of doing the same. After his remarks on Monday knocked over 6 percent off its shares, G.E. now has a slightly smaller market capitalization than Danaher — a company with revenue just one-sixth the size."
Op-Ed,2018-11-13,"In sports, the team that loses is the team that studies the game-day tapes the hardest. In the military, it’s called an after-action review. Businesses that don’t examine loss die. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/opinion/a-wake-up-call-for-the-gop.html,791," In sports, the team that loses is the team that studies the game-day tapes the hardest. In the military, it's called an after-action review. Businesses that don't examine loss die.  But somehow in politics, it's different. Too often, political figures simply blame the other side — or at least someone besides themselves. I know this firsthand. In June, after winning three straight elections to the House of Representatives from South Carolina, I lost my primary race to Katie Arrington, who in turn lost last week's general election to Joe Cunningham, a Democrat. After the general election, Ms. Arrington immediately blamed me for her loss because I did not endorse her. While it's human nature to blame someone, what happened here is far bigger than any postelection spin, given that it has been more than 40 years since a Democrat has held this seat, which runs along South Carolina's coast and leans Republican by 10 points. In fact, there was not a more conservative district in the country to flip to the Democrats.  For this reason, I think the race offers a chance for conservative soul-searching, and I say this as a committed conservative, who just happens not to be Trump enough in the age of Trump. The normal political dynamics at play in districts across the country held in this race. Both contestants were well financed, and you saw the same midterm drag on the Republican side that you saw in other congressional races.  But three things made this race different — things that could prove instructive for Republicans, if we choose to look at them. One, the environment matters to voters. As a party, we have somehow forgotten that conservatism should apply to more than just financial resources. Being conservative should entail being conservative with natural resources, too. I've always believed this — so much so that the Sierra Club endorsed me in my race for re-election as governor.  Not so many years ago, I was hardly an outlier. But the Republican playbook has changed, and it damages Republicans in suburban districts. In the primary, Ms. Arrington criticized my stand against offshore drilling and my disagreement with President Trump's plan to repeal a moratorium on offshore drilling — a moratorium that has held under Republican and Democratic presidents for 37 years. She attempted to pivot away from this stand in the general election, but voters didn't forget, and Mr. Cunningham was able to use it as a wedge issue.  As Republicans, we've drifted from our roots. The party, in fact, has a remarkable legacy on conservation and the environment — and this race suggests we should recommit ourselves to it. Two, financial irresponsibility proved a drag. Even in a hyperpartisan world, you still need reasons for traditional conservatives like myself to show up. It's got to be more than the blue team is bad.  One of the underpinnings of the Republican Party has long been financial responsibility, but here, again, the party has drifted. The president has done very little to trim the size of the federal government or entitlement spending, even as he asks for more money for corn farmers hit by his tariffs. That's hardly motivating for a traditional conservative. We need to once again be the party of not just lower taxes, but less spending. Third, civility is important. What happened to Ronald Reagan's notion of being a happy warrior? Like his policies or not, he was pleasant. He smiled. He joked. He played to optimism rather than fear. He and Tip O'Neill, the Democratic speaker of the House, had a famously strong working relationship despite their political differences. The Republican Party that so many of us care deeply about continues to be held hostage these days, and what I saw last week in a district I grew up in and know well is that there is a half-life to insults, bullying and an embrace of a post-truth world. I heard it from young soccer moms and longtime Republican voters alike. They don't want to condone behavior that is counter to what they've taught their children. In this district, my former opponent adopted Mr. Trump's highly combative style. It worked in the primary, but it fell flat in the general election. Mr. Cunningham presented himself as warm and affable.  Republicans got a wake-up call last week. But will we wake up? My party would be wise to take a step back from President Trump's approach to politics. We should renew our commitment to tenets like environmental conservation and financial responsibility. We should run from the president's zero-sum approach to politics.  These are not revolutionary ideas. But adhering to the simple approaches of kindness and respect, principles that have long guided society, could these days be groundbreaking.

News,2018-11-13,"CNN sued the Trump administration on Tuesday in an effort to reinstate the press credentials of its chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, escalating a dispute that has highlighted the increasingly tense dynamic between President Trump and the news media.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/business/media/cnn-jim-acosta-trump-lawsuit.html,1171," CNN sued the Trump administration on Tuesday in an effort to reinstate the press credentials of its chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, escalating a dispute that has highlighted the increasingly tense dynamic between President Trump and the news media. In a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court, the network argued that the removal of Mr. Acosta's White House press pass constituted a violation of his First Amendment rights to freely report on the government. CNN also asserted that the administration had violated Mr. Acosta's due process rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment when it revoked his credentials without warning. Mr. Acosta, who has frequently clashed with Mr. Trump, angered the president at a formal news conference last week with questions about immigration and the special counsel's investigation. The CNN correspondent would not give up the microphone after Mr. Trump tried to move on to another reporter. Hours later, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, announced that the administration had removed Mr. Acosta's credentials, which allowed him access to the White House grounds. The administration falsely claimed that Mr. Acosta had placed his hands on a White House intern who had tried to take his microphone away during the news conference. ""While the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta, this could have happened to anyone,"" CNN said in a statement. ""If left unchallenged, the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials."" A hearing on the lawsuit was set for Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. The judge in the case is Timothy J. Kelly, who was nominated last year by President Trump and then approved by the Senate. Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, the White House responded with a statement. ""This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit,"" Ms. Sanders wrote, noting that dozens of other CNN journalists have retained their White House credentials. Ms. Sanders made no mention of her original claim that Mr. Acosta had reacted inappropriately with the intern. Instead, she wrote that ""he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions."" ""The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional,"" she added. In turning to the courts, CNN has taken perhaps the most aggressive action yet by a news organization against a president. Mr. Trump has vilified the press since he started running for office in 2015. His denigration of the news media as ""the enemy of the American people"" — and his popularization of ""fake news"" as a way to dismiss critical coverage — has alarmed press freedom groups around the world. Supporters of Mr. Trump, though, are likely to seize on the lawsuit as evidence for the president's claim that news organizations, especially CNN, are biased against him. ""CNN sucks!"" has been a frequent chant at Mr. Trump's rallies. The reporter Bob Woodward, speaking in Florida on Tuesday, said that a lawsuit may play into Mr. Trump's hands. On Tuesday, the network and Mr. Acosta, a White House correspondent, sued over the revocation of his credentials. ""I think Trump would sit around and look at this and say, 'This is great,'"" Mr. Woodward said onstage at the Global Financial Leadership Conference. ""Nixon effectively made the conduct of the media the issue, rather than his conduct. Trump has adopted that strategy, he's refined it. It's very effective, and so when we engage in it, we're taking his bait, in my view."" Floyd Abrams, the noted First Amendment lawyer, said in an interview on Tuesday that CNN's legal action was necessary, even as he acknowledged the potential political fallout. ""I can understand the reluctance — at a time when the president is saying, 'CNN is hostile to me' — for a lawsuit to be filed with the caption 'CNN v. Donald Trump,'"" Mr. Abrams said. ""That said, sometimes a strong response is necessary, both for the institution itself and for the broader cause for which it effectively speaks."" Mr. Acosta, who has a reputation as a showboat among some of his press corps colleagues, is not the first White House reporter to aggressively question a president in public. One of his predecessors, the ABC correspondent Sam Donaldson, said in a memo filed with CNN's lawsuit that he knew of no precedent for a journalist's credentials being withdrawn and ""never would have imagined such action was possible."" Still, rival networks have not issued formal statements in support of CNN or Mr. Acosta. The White House Correspondents' Association on Tuesday criticized the removal of Mr. Acosta's credential, but did not address the lawsuit itself. ""Revoking access to the White House complex amounted to disproportionate reaction to the events of last Wednesday,"" the group's president, Olivier Knox of SiriusXM radio, wrote. ""The president of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him."" CNN's argument for restoring Mr. Acosta's credential resembles a lawsuit in 1977 that involved Robert Sherrill, then a correspondent for The Nation magazine who was denied a White House press pass. A court ruled that the Secret Service had to follow a clear process, including prior written notice, before revoking a journalist's credentials, a precedent cited on Tuesday by CNN's legal team. Andrew Napolitano, a former Superior Court judge in New Jersey and sometime Trump confidant, said on Tuesday that he expected CNN to prevail. ""Obviously, Acosta may have been an irritant to the president, but he was hardly a danger to him,"" Mr. Napolitano said on the Fox Business Network. ""CNN's got a very good case. I think this will be resolved quickly. I don't expect a jury trial."" Ms. Sanders is named as a defendant in the suit, along with Mr. Trump; his chief of staff, John Kelly; the head of White House communications strategy, Bill Shine; and the Secret Service. The lawsuit states that Jeff Zucker, CNN's president, personally wrote to Mr. Kelly last Thursday asking for Mr. Acosta's press pass to be reinstated. Mr. Zucker also accused the administration of a ""pattern of targeted harassment"" against journalists from CNN. CNN also said in the suit that Mr. Acosta was prevented from covering parts of Mr. Trump's weekend trip to Paris, and that his request last Thursday for a temporary day pass to the White House was rejected. CNN's corporate parent, AT&T, remains embroiled in its own legal battle with the administration. The Justice Department filed a federal appeal in July to unravel AT&T's merger with Time Warner, which owns CNN. Arguments in that case are scheduled to be heard on Dec. 6. The government had tried to block the deal before it was approved by a federal judge in June. The law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher is representing CNN in the Acosta lawsuit. The legal team includes Theodore B. Olson, who served as solicitor general under former President George W. Bush. Mr. Trump previously tried to hire Mr. Olson for his own legal team, without success."
News,2018-11-13,"JERSEY CITY — Two years ago this month, Mayada Anjari was only dimly aware that a holiday was approaching. After the family’s three-year journey as refugees from Syria, her sons — Hayan, Mohammed and Abdulrazaq — had just started school here; her husband, Ahmad Abdulhamid, was looking for work; and she had a baby girl, Jana, to chase after. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/dining/thanksgiving-refugees.html,1860," JERSEY CITY — Two years ago this month, Mayada Anjari was only dimly aware that a holiday was approaching. After the family's three-year journey as refugees from Syria, her sons — Hayan, Mohammed and Abdulrazaq — had just started school here; her husband, Ahmad Abdulhamid, was looking for work; and she had a baby girl, Jana, to chase after.  By last fall, the boys (now 14, 12 and 10) had learned about the Pilgrims (and to dislike broccoli), their father was working full time, and Ms. Anjari had memorized the two-mile walk to the nearest store that stocked staples like grape leaves and flatbread and olives. She had cooked for the church group that sponsored the family's resettlement, and some people in Manhattan had even paid to eat her kabsa (spice-rubbed chicken with scented rice), her expertly stuffed vegetables, and her fatayer, folds of flaky pastry stuffed with ground meat or spiraled around soft cheese.  A new friend who was also Muslim gave her a turkey from a local halal butcher for Thanksgiving. Ms. Anjari cut it into pieces, covered it with water, and simmered it into soup with potatoes, carrots, ginger and cumin. Her family liked it, she said, but it didn't seem very special to her.  This fall, Jana began prekindergarten, and fans of Ms. Anjari's food helped her publish a cookbook of Syrian recipes. So she decided to take a test run at making her first Thanksgiving feast.  Like many people who have recently arrived in America from other countries, Ms. Anjari, 33, found the holiday a bit perplexing. At home, she said, family celebrations and feast days are reserved for religious events. ""People do things in so many different ways here,"" she said: how they dress, how they raise children, how they worship. ""I was surprised that there's a holiday that everyone celebrates."" Before she even began cooking, there were many mysteries to be solved, with the help of people like Jennifer Sit, her co-author on the cookbook; Mira Evnine, who assisted with the book's photography; and Dave Mammen, part of the refugee task force at Rutgers Presbyterian Church on the Upper West Side.  Were the apples really going to be baked with cinnamon, a spice that Ms. Anjari uses with meat and chicken? Why would you roast a bird whole — how would it get evenly cooked that way? How can macaroni and cheese, one of her children's favorite dinners, be a side dish? Were the mashed potatoes not going to be seasoned with a little garlic and a lot of caramelized onions, the way she makes them?  ""Without it, there isn't much flavor, no?"" she asked, speaking through an interpreter, knitting her expression into a question, as she so often must in her new life.  The family left their home city, Homs, on March 31, 2013, when the daily violence of the civil war had made their lives untenable. They walked across the Jordan border in darkness, were picked up by the Jordanian military and were settled in the small city of Ajloun. They registered as refugees with the United Nations, so the boys could attend school, but the adults couldn't work legally. Food and money were always scarce.  Working with the United Nations Refugee Agency, the Department of State brings a certain number of refugees each year — most of them families with young children — to resettle in the United States. Only people displaced by violence or the threat of violence (like asylum seekers) can apply; the program is separate from other American immigration quotas and regulations.  In 2016, the year the family arrived in New Jersey, the United States accepted about 85,000 refugees for resettlement, including more than 15,000 Syrians; in 2017, the total dropped to about 52,000. So far in 2018, about 22,000 people have been allowed in, and just 50 of them were Syrian. Despite the continuing civil war and refugee crisis, Syria is one of seven countries from which the Trump administration has forbidden people to enter the United States. The vetting process for resettlement takes about two years. While Ms. Anjari, her husband and their children were admitted, dozens of their relatives are still stranded in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. With public and private funding, the State Department and nine independent agencies (like Church World Service, which guided the Rutgers group) sponsor and shepherd the refugees through their first year of American life, providing money, clothing, shelter and guidance on everything from groceries to G.E.D.s.  From the day of arrival, food is an integral part of adjustment to a new country.  On the State Department's list of things that sponsors must provide immediately is a ""culturally appropriate"" meal for the family. Some sponsors interpret this in religious terms, and provide store-bought halal fried chicken or kosher pizza. But others take the responsibility more literally, going to great lengths to greet arrivals with home-cooked food that is specific to their place of origin, familiar and comforting.  ""They already have been through so much when they get here — they shouldn't have to get used to another new thing right away,"" said Ulla Farmer, a member of the Rutgers congregation, who made the first dinner for the Anjari-Abdulhamid family even though she had never tasted Syrian food. (She immigrated from Finland in 1963.)  Working from online recipes and grocery lists, Ms. Farmer cooked a dinner of lamb stew and cracked wheat, and stocked the family's new kitchen with key ingredients like tahini, yogurt, cucumbers and rice.  ""The culturally appropriate hot meal is simply the best federal regulation of all time,"" said Chris George, executive director of Integrated Refugees & Immigrants Services, a New Haven agency that has resettled more than 6,000 refugees in Connecticut since 1982.  Mr. George is a passionate advocate for what he calls the CAHM (he even wrote a song about it), and his enthusiasm has percolated through the agency. For Congolese and Rwandan arrivals, volunteers have made chicken moambe, a braise with tomato, onion, peanut butter and rich red palm oil, a basic ingredient in those countries and for many, the taste of home. For an Eritrean mother and children, an Ethiopian family who had arrived earlier supplied a meal with injera, the soft, spongy flatbread that is a staple in both countries.  Fereshteh Ganjavi, who arrived from Afghanistan in 2013 and now works at Integrated Refugees, said the meal is particularly powerful for refugees who arrive after years of exile from their home country. Her welcome dinner included a traditional pulao of lamb and rice with raisins, and green tea spiced with saffron and cardamom, a brew specific to the mountainous Hindu Kush region that stretches across northern Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""We were living in a camp before entering the U.S., and I had almost forgotten the taste of our own food,"" she said. Dima King, who arrived in the United States last year, is seeking asylum because of the anti-gay persecution and legislation that have taken hold in his native Russia since 2013. He is cooking his first Thanksgiving dinner this year.  ""I understood it right away as a celebration of new Americans and Native Americans,"" he said. Holidays that celebrate a good harvest are universal, he said, but Thanksgiving also honors the practice of treating strangers with generosity, charity and humanity. ""Of course, that is a holiday I want to cook for."" Mr. King is a graduate of Emma's Torch, a nonprofit restaurant in Red Hook, Brooklyn, that offers professional culinary training to resettled refugees; he is soon to start a job as a line cook at Temple Court, a chic restaurant in the financial district.  Still, he said he is intimidated by roasting a whole turkey (a skill that is rarely taught in culinary school) and will likely attempt a smaller cut. But he has fully envisioned the dessert: a pumpkin pie with meringue topping.  ""I'm definitely going to use fresh pumpkin,"" he said. ""I've learned to be very comfortable with vegetables."" Even for trained and accomplished cooks like Mr. King and Ms. Anjari, the traditional Thanksgiving dinner can seem rife with unfamiliar flavors and methods. The multitude of soft, starchy dishes (like mashed potatoes, yams, stuffing and pie), the sharpness of cranberry sauce and the sheer size of a turkey strike many first-timers as peculiar.  Ms. Anjari, like most Syrian women, has been cooking since childhood, and thinks nothing of whipping up dinner for 60 people. She immediately set about making the Thanksgiving dishes her own.  She approached her first whole turkey as if making kabsa: Starting with whole-milk yogurt, she added grated onion, tomato paste, shards of cinnamon and nutmeg, turmeric and black pepper, and rubbed the mixture all over the skin.  She put the bird in one of her lightweight round tins — a heavy roasting pan with handles is not part of her cookware collection — covered it tightly with foil, and let it cook at high heat; then lowered the oven, removed the foil and let it brown. Finally, she toasted slivered almonds in clarified butter (the Middle Eastern version, called samna, is prized for its lush, tangy flavor) and scattered them over the bird for a rich, crunchy garnish.  She had already taken some brussels sprouts for a trial run, roasting them plain with salt and pepper until slightly caramelized. ""Little cabbages!"" she said with pleasure, slicing one open for the first time.  Now, with the oven occupied by the turkey, she shallow-fried the sprouts on top of the stove, and dressed them with a fundamental sauce from the Syrian canon: tahini and yogurt mixed together and spiked with fresh garlic.  Working quickly, by hand and without measuring, she mixed a batch of the butter-rich dough she uses for ma'amoul, classic date-stuffed cookies: It would be used to line a pan for her first apple pie.  In Syria, she said, she routinely made batches of the same dough using 25 pounds of flour and six pounds of sugar. All the women of the family, including her mother, three sisters and countless in-laws and cousins, would gather to share the painstaking work of pinching, filling and pressing.  Peeling apple after apple without even looking down at her hands, her phone pinging with messages from relatives who remain in the Middle East, she said that cooking alone had been a hard adjustment. ""That's when I miss home the most,"" she said.  Ms. Anjari brought her recipes to this country not in book form but in memory. She had never seen a cookbook before arriving in the United States, she said. Hers is called ""The Bread and Salt Between Us,"" an expression in Arabic that connotes mutual respect and the beginning of an alliance or friendship.  Finally, she sat down to taste the food, surrounded by her children and a crush of friends, interpreters, sponsors and assorted cookbook helpers. As a cook, she understands both that making Thanksgiving dinner is part of the passage to American life, and that mastering it gradually is a fine approach.  But this year, the appeal of sweet potatoes — even mashed with butter and salt — continued to elude her.  ""Next time,"" she said, like many a Thanksgiving cook, ""I'll make them better.""

Review,2018-11-13,"CHURCHILL Walking With Destiny By Andrew Roberts Illustrated. 1,105 pp. Viking. $40.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/books/review/andrew-roberts-churchill-winston-biography.html,1661," CHURCHILL Walking With Destiny By Andrew Roberts Illustrated. 1,105 pp. Viking. $40. In April 1955, on the final weekend before he left office for the last time, Winston Churchill had the vast canvas of Peter Paul Rubens's ""The Lion and the Mouse"" taken down from the Great Hall at the prime ministerial retreat of Chequers. He had always found the depiction of the mouse too indistinct, so he retrieved his paint brushes and set about ""improving"" on the work of Rubens by making the hazy rodent clearer. ""If that is not courage,"" Lord Mountbatten, the First Sea Lord, said later, ""I do not know what is."" Lack of courage was never Churchill's problem. As a young man he was mentioned in dispatches for his bravery fighting alongside the Malakand Field Force on the North-West Frontier, and subsequently he took part in the last significant cavalry charge in British history at the Battle of Omdurman in central Sudan. In middle age he served in the trenches of World War I, during which time a German high-explosive shell came in through the roof of his dugout and blew his mess orderly's head clean off. Later, as prime minister during World War II, and by now in his mid-60s, he thought nothing of visiting bomb sites during the Blitz or crossing the treacherous waters of the Atlantic to see President Roosevelt despite the very real chance of being torpedoed by German U-boats. Churchill had political courage too, not least as one of the few to oppose the appeasement of Hitler. Many had thought him a warmonger and even a traitor. ""I have always felt,"" said that scion of the Establishment, Lord Ponsonby, at the time of the Munich debate in 1938, ""that in a crisis he is one of the first people who ought to be interned."" Instead, when the moment of supreme crisis came in 1940, the British people turned to him for leadership. Here was his ultimate projection of courage: that Britain would ""never surrender."" If courage was not the issue, lack of judgment often was. Famous military disasters attached to his name, including Antwerp in 1914, the Dardanelles (Gallipoli) in 1915 and Narvik in 1940. So too did political controversies, like turning up in person to instruct the police during a violent street battle with anarchists, defying John Maynard Keynes in returning Britain to the gold standard or rashly supporting Edward VIII during the abdication crisis. His views on race and empire were anachronistic even for those times. The carpet bombing of German cities during World War II; the ""naughty document"" that handed over Romania and Bulgaria to Stalin; comparing the Labour Party to the Gestapo — the list of Churchillian controversies goes on. Each raised questions about his temperament and character. His drinking habits also attracted comment. Such is the challenge facing any biographer of Churchill: how to weigh in the balance a life filled with so much triumph and disaster, adulation and contempt. The historian Andrew Roberts's insight about Churchill's relation to fate in ""Churchill: Walking With Destiny"" comes directly from the subject himself. ""I felt as if I were walking with destiny,"" Churchill wrote of that moment in May 1940 when he achieved the highest office. But the story Roberts tells is more sophisticated and in the end more satisfying. ""For although he was indeed walking with destiny in May 1940, it was a destiny that he had consciously spent a lifetime shaping,"" Roberts writes, adding that Churchill learned from his mistakes, and ""put those lessons to use during civilization's most testing hour."" Experience and reflection on painful failures, while less glamorous than a fate written in the stars, turn out to be the key ingredients in Churchill's ultimate success. He did not get off to a particularly happy start. His erratic and narcissistic father, Lord Randolph Churchill, saw the boy as ""among the second rate and third rate,"" predicting that his life would ""degenerate into a shabby, unhappy and futile existence."" His American mother, Jennie, was often not much kinder, sending letters to him at Harrow that must have arrived like a Howler in a Harry Potter novel. Parental judgments became an obvious spur to fame and attention. ""Few,"" Roberts writes, ""have set out with more coldblooded deliberation to become first a hero and then a Great Man."" After stints in Cuba, India and Sudan, Churchill achieved instant fame during the Boer War after a daring escape from a South African P.O.W. camp in 1899. That renown propelled him into Parliament, where he soon added notoriety to his reputation by crossing the floor of the House of Commons, abandoning the Conservative Party for the Liberals. Thereafter, wrote his friend Violet, daughter of the future prime minister H. H. Asquith, he was viewed as ""a rat, a turncoat, an arriviste and, worst crime of all, one who had certainly arrived."" ""We are all worms,"" Churchill told her. ""But I do believe that I am a glowworm."" And glow he did, becoming in 1908, at 33, the youngest cabinet member in 40 years and subsequently the youngest home secretary since Peel in 1822. As First Lord of the Admiralty he was credited with making the navy ready for war — his single most important achievement in government before 1940. Even when disaster befell him, Churchill always managed to bounce back. A new prime minister, David Lloyd George, returned him to the wartime cabinet despite the catastrophe of the Dardanelles. When the Liberal Party disintegrated after the rise of Labour, Churchill conveniently ""re-ratted"" back to the Conservatives, where Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin put him unhappily in charge of the nation's finances. By the late 1930s, out of office and despised for his opposition to appeasement, Churchill seemed finished once and for all. But he was ready. ""The Dardanelles catastrophe taught him not to overrule the Chiefs of Staff,"" Roberts writes, ""the General Strike and Tonypandy taught him to leave industrial relations during the Second World War to Labour's Ernest Bevin; the Gold Standard disaster taught him to reflate and keep as much liquidity in the financial system as the exigencies of wartime would allow."" Less well known is that Churchill also learned from his successes. Cryptographical breakthroughs at the Admiralty during World War I led him to back Alan Turing and the Ultra decrypters in the second war; the anti-U-boat campaign of 1917 instructed him about the convoy system; his earlier advocacy of the tank encouraged him to support the development of new weaponry. Research for a life of Marlborough (a book that Leo Strauss called the greatest historical work of the 20th century) taught Churchill the value of international alliances in wartime. If Churchill's entire life was a preparation for 1940, ""the man and the moment only just coincided."" He was 65 years old when he became prime minister and had only just re-entered front-line politics after a decade out of office. It would be like Tony Blair returning to 10 Downing Street today, ready to put lessons learned during the Iraq war to work. Had Hitler delayed by a few years, Roberts suggests, Churchill would surely have been away from front-rank politics too long to ""make himself the one indispensable figure."" Experience certainly did not make success inevitable. In France, Marshal Pétain, revered as the ""Lion of Verdun"" for his glorious career in World War I, made all the wrong decisions as prime minister from June 1940 onward, equating peace with occupation and collaboration. Churchill was the anti-Pétain, but what was it that made him ""indispensable""? Hope, certainly, and an ability to communicate resolve with both clarity and force. Recordings of wartime speeches can still provoke goose bumps. In the end, Roberts sums up Churchill's overriding achievement in a single sentence: It was ""not that he stopped a German invasion … but that he stopped the British government from making a peace."" That turned out to be the whole ballgame. After the Battle of Britain was won and, first, the Russians and, then, the Americans came into the war, Churchill knew that ""time and patience will give certain victory."" But it also meant a gradual relegation to second if not third place. Britain had entered the war as the most prestigious of the world's great powers. By its conclusion, having lost about a quarter of its national wealth in fighting the war, Britain had become the fraction in the Big Two and a Half, and was effectively bust. Sic transit gloria mundi. Roberts tells this story with great authority and not a little panache. He writes elegantly, with enjoyable flashes of tartness, and is in complete command both of his sources and the vast historiography. For a book of a thousand pages, there are surprisingly no longueurs. Roberts is admiring of Churchill, but not uncritically so. Often he lays out the various debates before the reader so that we can draw different conclusions to his own. Essentially a conservative realist, he sees political and military controversies through the lens of the art of the possible. Only once does he really bristle, when Churchill says of Stalin in 1945, ""I like that man."" ""Where was the Churchill of 1931,"" he laments, ""who had denounced Stalin's 'morning's budget of death warrants'?"" Some may find Roberts's emphasis on politics and war old-fashioned, indistinguishable, say, from the approach taken almost half a century ago by Henry Pelling. He is out of step with much of the best British history being written today, where the likes of Dominic Sandbrook, Or Rosenboim and John Bew have successfully blended cultural and intellectual history with the study of high politics. But it would be foolish to say Roberts made the wrong choice. He is Thucydidean in viewing decisions about war and politics, politics and war as the crux of the matter. A life defined by politics here rightly gets a political life. All told, it must surely be the best single-volume biography of Churchill yet written."
News,2018-11-13,"New Jersey officials, taking on one of the state’s core industries, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson that manufactures opioids, accusing the pharmaceutical company of misleading patients about the addictive dangers posed by its drugs.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/nyregion/nj-opioid-lawsuit.html,1118," New Jersey officials, taking on one of the state's core industries, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson that manufactures opioids, accusing the pharmaceutical company of misleading patients about the addictive dangers posed by its drugs. It was the first time that New Jersey has brought legal action against a company based in the state as it struggles to contain a spiraling opioid addiction crisis. And it comes at a time when state attorneys general across the country have intensified their efforts to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for the epidemics of abuse. Gurbir Grewal, the New Jersey attorney general, said the subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, minimized the risks of opioid addiction in its marketing messages, targeted older people and other patients with little knowledge of opioids and mounted a campaign to ""embed its deceptions about the viability of long-term opioid use in the minds of doctors and patients."" ""It is especially troubling that so much of the alleged misconduct took place right here in our own backyard,"" Mr. Grewal said at a news conference announcing the legal action. ""New Jersey's pharmaceutical industry is the envy of the world, with a long history of developing vital, lifesaving drugs. But we cannot turn a blind eye when a New Jersey company like Janssen violates our laws and threatens the lives of our residents."" A representative for Janssen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In the absence of any significant federal action to stem the opioid epidemic, states have been leading the charge to grapple with a health crisis that has yet to be contained. In 2017, there were more than 72,000 overdose deaths in the country from opioids, a 10 percent rise from the previous year. More than 40 state attorneys general have joined New York state in a multiyear, wide-ranging investigation of manufacturers and distributors of opioids. Eleven states, including New Jersey, have filed separate lawsuits against Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin, a popular opioid painkiller. ""It became a state issue because there wasn't a lot of movement on the federal level,"" said Lewis S. Nelson, the chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Rutgers University. ""To this date, the federal government hasn't been very effective at regulating the practices of these pharmaceutical companies."" In addition to the human toll, the opioid crisis has also imposed a significant financial burden that has been largely shouldered by states, Dr. Nelson said, including paying for hospital bills, drug courts and emergency response. In New Jersey, the state also pays for opioids through public employee health plans, according to the lawsuit. New Jersey spent $178 million between 2010 and 2017 for opioid prescriptions submitted to employee health plans, according to the attorney general's office. While there have been some positive trends in the opioid epidemics at the national level, including a drop in the number of overdose deaths in parts of New England, New Jersey's death rate has been rising steadily. Nearly 2,700 overdose deaths have been confirmed in the first 10 months of this year, according to data collected by the state attorney general's office. In 2017, preliminary data show that there were 2,750 overdose-related deaths. The opioid crisis in New Jersey became the main focus of Gov. Chris Christie's final year in office and he used his national platform as a presidential candidate to repeatedly call for reforms on treating opioid addiction and prosecuting drug abusers. President Trump also named Mr. Christie as chairman of his commission on the opioid crisis. Besides suing Purdue Pharma, the Christie administration also sued Insys Therapeutics, an Arizona-based opioid manufacturer. But the lawsuit announced by Mr. Grewal represents a new front in New Jersey's battle against the scourge of opioids, targeting a company that plays a key role in the state's economy. New Jersey has a deep and lucrative connection with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Often referred to as ""The Medicine Chest of the World,"" New Jersey was once home to many major pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as Pfizer, Merck and Johnson and Johnson. And while some companies have left the state, the industry still accounts for roughly 120,000 jobs, totaling $16.5 billion in annual payroll in 2016, or 7.8 percent of the state's total wages. Mr. Grewal told reporters that his office was not investigating Janssen's parent company, Johnson & Johnson, but said that additional charges could be filed. Though Janssen is one of the state's largest employers, Mr. Grewal said that did not factor into his office's decision making. ""We're not shying away from holding folks accountable,"" Mr. Grewal said. ""If they're culpable, we'll hold them accountable."" The lawsuit is similar to other lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, tracing the evolution of opioids from short-dosage painkillers in the early 1990s to drugs whose effects are more long term. ""Janssen joined the wave of opioid manufacturers working to persuade health care providers and patients — including the elderly and opioid-naïve — that pain had been widely and improperly under-treated, and that opioid pain medications were the answer,"" the lawsuit says. Mr. Grewal stood beside placards displaying what his office said were examples of Janssen's fraudulent marketing campaigns for their opioid products. While Janssen sold the rights to the two drugs in 2015 for over $1 billion, Mr. Grewal said his office was focusing on the eight-year period that the company marketed the drugs. ""They funded bogus research,"" he said. ""They pushed bogus theories like pseudoaddiction, things that have been debunked. They positioned Nucynta and Nucynta ER as the safer alternative to other more powerful opioid drugs and, as the director mentioned, in fact, they were the same types of opioid drugs."" The lawsuit also pointed to disturbing trends in the prescription. Over the course of a year, one patient on a state health care plan received 125 prescriptions for two opioids, Nucynta and Nucynta ER — more than a 2,700-day supply. The prescriptions were written by a health care provider ""who had received hundreds of visits from Janssen sales representatives."" The mounting legal campaigns against pharmaceutical companies, Dr. Nelson said, highlights how complicit many believe they are for the crisis. ""Everybody on opioids for more than a couple of weeks is dependent, only about five to 10 percent of people develop addiction,"" he said. ""But remember, five to 10 percent of millions and millions of people is a lot of people. So, that's what the state attorneys general are really fighting against. They're fighting against the fact that all of these companies put out marketing and misinformation that these drugs don't cause addiction, don't cause dependence, don't lead to abuse."" ""In reality,"" Dr. Nelson added. ""Lots and lots of people died using the drugs as directed."""

More questions for Boeing about the Lion Air crash, new evidence in a Saudi journalist's killing, a loyal dog in China. Here's what you need to know:  • Mounting questions for Boeing over Indonesian crash. Pilots said the aircraft maker didn't tell them about changes to the emergency system on its new 737 Max 8 jet, the model in the Lion Air 610 disaster that killed 189 people. Investigators have been focused on whether the emergency system caused the accident. It's designed to automatically correct a plane's angle if it appears to be stalling. But if it malfunctions, it could send a plane into a potentially fatal nose-dive. Indonesian transportation officials have said the manual for the new Boeing model didn't contain information about the update. And pilots said the onboard check list, which contains information about overriding the emergency system, was incorrect. More than 4,700 orders have been placed worldwide for the Max 8. It is especially popular with low-cost carriers looking for dependable workhorses for shorter flights. The precise cause or causes of the crash remain unknown. _____ • ""Tell your boss"" the mission is complete. That's what one operative said to a superior over the phone shortly after the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi consulate in Turkey, our reporters have learned. Above, a memorial image of Mr. Khashoggi. A recording of the conversation was shared with the C.I.A. last month, and U.S. intelligence officials believe ""your boss"" refers to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, presenting the strongest evidence yet that links him to the killing. On Tuesday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey pressed Prince Mohammed for answers. ""We want the person who gave the order to be revealed,"" he told Turkish media. The new evidence also intensifies pressure on the White House to take more punitive action against Saudi Arabia, an important ally. _____ • A plan for Brexit. After months of deadlock, Britain and the E.U. have reached a draft agreement over the terms of their divorce. But there's still a long road ahead. The plan first needs approval from Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet, where hard-line Brexiteers could put up a fight, then from a Parliament stacked with opponents. Here are all the sticking points that could derail the deal. Above, anti-Brexit protests. Details of the outline agreement aren't available yet, but the prime minister has made it clear she wants to avoid a so-called ""no-deal"" Brexit, an abrupt withdrawal with no measures to avoid a chaotic transition. The cabinet is scheduled to meet today. If members give the plan the green light, European leaders will need to give it their blessing at the end of the month. Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc in March. _____ • Russian disinformation, from the Cold War to Pizzagate. Moscow's meddling in U.S. elections is not a hoax. The 2016 presidential campaign capped Russia's decades-long strategy of creating divisions in the West and undermining democracies, often in places ill-equipped to combat the threat.

Op-Ed,2018-11-14,"GRAND ISLAND, N.Y. — In August, Representative Chris Collins, the first member of Congress to endorse Donald Trump for president, was indicted on federal insider trading charges. Yet last week, voters appeared to have re-elected him by a narrow margin: As of Monday, he was leading by fewer than 3,000 votes, with nearly 18,000 ballots, including absentee and affidavit ballots, left to count.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/opinion/trump-chris-collins-reelection.html,944," GRAND ISLAND, N.Y. — In August, Representative Chris Collins, the first member of Congress to endorse Donald Trump for president, was indicted on federal insider trading charges. Yet last week, voters appeared to have re-elected him by a narrow margin: As of Monday, he was leading by fewer than 3,000 votes, with nearly 18,000 ballots, including absentee and affidavit ballots, left to count. But Mr. Collins's likely re-election while under criminal indictment is possibly not the most unusual thing about his political career. Equally remarkable was his swift transformation from a mainstream, fiscally conservative Republican into a cheerleader for Mr. Trump and his hard-right brand of nationalism. A decade ago, Mr. Collins was the executive of Erie County, where I live. He was a typical Republican. The county's finances were in disarray, and Mr. Collins, a successful entrepreneur and engineer, campaigned as a technocrat, pledging to ""run government like a business."" He hired consultants devoted to Six Sigma, the management fad popularized by Jack Welch at General Electric, and promised to give the bureaucracy a business school shakedown and maybe lower taxes to boot. Chris Collins was not a populist radical. He was a boring Mitt Romney Republican with a dash of Tea Party. His efforts at reform in the midst of the financial crisis failed, and Mr. Collins lost his re-election bid in 2011. But in 2012, he narrowly defeated the Democratic representative in the 27th Congressional District, who had won in a special election after the Republican incumbent had resigned in a sexting scandal. At the time, people wondered why the guy who said he was a ""chief executive, not a chief politician,"" even wanted the job. During his first term, Mr. Collins was a little-known backbencher. The 27th District, which encircles the Democratic stronghold of Buffalo, consists of upscale exurbs, lakeshore communities and farmland with more cows than people. His constituents were happy for him to be a reliable Republican vote and little more — he won re-election with over two-thirds of the vote in both 2014 and 2016 — and his legislative accomplishments were largely limited to naming post offices. Until Donald Trump. Whatever motivated his endorsement, Mr. Collins traded in his reserved character for a MAGA cap and went all in, becoming a fixture on Fox News during the campaign, and then championing Mr. Trump's nominees and policies after the election. The chief executive had become the chief apologist. We now know that Mr. Collins used his assignments on the House Energy and Commerce Committees to give stock tips to fellow congressmen and promote legislation beneficial to his health care industry investments. According to the federal indictment, Mr. Collins made a phone call urging family members to dump shares of a pharmaceutical company before news of a failed drug test was made public during a June 2017 picnic at the White House. In the midterms, Mr. Collins's Democratic opponent was Nate McMurray, the supervisor of my small town, Grand Island. I know Nate, but then everyone here knows Nate. Buffalo is the kind of place where we expect to bump into our politicians and professional athletes in the grocery store, and we see nothing rude in stopping them to talk about the game last Sunday. This is especially true on Grand Island. Despite this, Chris Collins said I should fear Nate — because he speaks Korean. A Collins campaign ad that ran just days before the election shows a video of Mr. McMurray bowing and speaking in Korean in slow motion. Beneath him runs a subtitle warning that Mr. McMurray ""worked to send jobs to China and Korea."" In the background an image of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, flashes by. ""You can take Nate McMurray at his word,"" warns the ad. His Korean word.  Yet Mr. McMurray, who is married to a Korean woman, never said anything in the video about jobs, and there is no evidence he ever ""worked to send"" American jobs overseas. He posted the video himself on YouTube in June as a gesture of international good will before President Trump's nuclear summit with Mr. Kim. Mr. Collins was implicitly attacking Mr. McMurray's Korean wife and his Korean-speaking children. That's not how things normally work on Grand Island. ""Big island, small town"" goes the saying. It's Republican in a keep-my-taxes-low sort of way. Mr. McMurray won his supervisor position by only 14 votes, but in a race where the worst high jinks involved stealing opponent's lawn signs. (Disclosure: my wife, Jessica Castner, while not a paid member of his staff, has been Mr. McMurray's science adviser for environmental issues.) A charismatic campaigner, Mr. McMurray crisscrossed the district and likely met many of the people who voted for him. Mr. Collins dropped out of the race after being indicted, then got back in, did almost no campaigning, spoke to only one or two friendly members of the news media, has never held a town hall and has sworn he never will. He's not around to stop at the grocery store. Yet he appears to have won in this district that cast 59 percent of its votes for Donald Trump in 2016. Our country's tribalism was on full display in the 27th, with party loyalty, or Trump loyalty, apparently overcoming consideration of the quality and character of the individual candidates. Some of his critics say that Mr. Collins was always a corrupt, casual racist, that Donald Trump merely unleashed what was always inside. I don't know. All I do know is that I don't recognize the former country executive, or his party at all.

News,2018-11-14,[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/nyregion/el-chapo-trial.html,1005," [What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Lawyers for Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the infamous drug lord known as El Chapo, claimed on Tuesday that for decades their client had been framed by a vast conspiracy of plotters, including his chief lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel, American drug agents, and the last two presidents of Mexico. The defense's claim was an unexpected start to Mr. Guzmán's drug conspiracy trial, which after several delays on Tuesday began under tight security in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. During an impassioned opening statement, one of Mr. Guzmán's lawyers, Jeffrey Lichtman, said that the real mastermind of the cartel, which Mr. Guzmán has been accused of running for decades, was his longtime partner Ismael Zambada Garcia. Describing Mr. Guzmán as no more than ""a scapegoat,"" Mr. Lichtman argued that Mr. Zambada, known as El Mayo, had been the one to oversee 20 years of drug shipments into the United States, and who repeatedly paid off — to the tune of millions of dollars — a ""completely corrupt"" Mexican government, including top officials like President Enrique Peña Nieto and his predecessor, Felipe Calderón. ""The world is focusing on this mythical El Chapo creature,"" Mr. Lichtman said. ""The world is not focusing on Mayo Zambada."" Mr. Zambada, 70, has long been one of Mr. Guzman's closest deputies and is believed to be still at large in Mexico. Though he has been never been arrested, he was named as a defendant in the same 2009 indictment that prosecutors in New York used to charge Mr. Guzman. Both Mr. Zambada's son, Vicente Zambada-Niebla, and his brother, Jesus Reynaldo Zambada García, are in custody in the United States and may appear as witnesses at the trial. Mr. Calderón and Mr. Peña Nieto, the former Mexican presidents, put out statements on Twitter saying Mr. Lichtman's claims were ""absolutely false."" Almost immediately after the defense offered its conspiracy theory, Judge Brian M. Cogan excused the jury for the day. In their absence, the judge cautioned Mr. Lichtman against making statements that might not be supported by evidence or that the judge's own rulings could preclude as inadmissible. Judge Cogan ordered both the defense and prosecution to submit written briefings on the claims, indicating that the main thrust of Mr. Guzmán's defense will now face judicial scrutiny even though the trial is underway. In the nearly two years that Mr. Guzmán, 59, has been in custody in New York preparing for his long-awaited trial, his legal team has only given hints at a defense, sometimes suggesting at hearings and in court papers that he never played as central a role in the Sinaloa drug cartel as the government has claimed. But Mr. Lichtman's speech on Tuesday posited what amounted to a complex, cross-border scheme to railroad Mr. Guzmán, one that was undertaken, he claimed, not only by compromised Mexican officials, but also by ""crooked"" agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration. The government's own witnesses will soon testify that some of those agents allowed Mr. Zambada to traffic drugs freely, Mr. Lichtman said. The defense's arguments, which will continue Wednesday morning, came after Adam Fels, a federal prosecutor, told the jury the evidence would prove Mr. Guzmán was not only the cartel's leader, but the world's biggest drug dealer. Mr. Fels said that authorities in the United States have seized more than 40 tons of Mr. Guzmán's cocaine. That was enough, he said, to form 328 million separate lines of the drug. Mr. Fels also said that during his long career, Mr. Guzmán had a payroll of corrupt officials and a violent army of sicarios — professional assassins — to protect his multibillion-dollar empire. ""Money, drugs, murder, a vast global narcotics trafficking organization,"" Mr. Fels told the jury. ""That is what this case is about."" The government has accused Mr. Guzmán not only of having a hand in dozens of killings in his homeland, but also of running a sprawling organization that smuggled at least 200 tons of cocaine into the United States in a fleet of yachts, planes, fishing boats and submarines. Guzmán was convicted on drug and murder charges in Mexico in 1993, but escaped from prison twice — once, according to some accounts, in a jailhouse laundry cart and later on a motorcycle his associates left for him in a mile-long tunnel they dug into the shower of his cell. Federal prosecutors plan to present a parade of cooperating witnesses and a mountain of evidence, including drug ledgers, satellite photos and secretly recorded audiotapes. They have promised that evidence will show that Mr. Guzmán raked in $14 billion in illicit profits. The trial has received extraordinary media attention. So many journalists from the United States and Mexico showed up to cover the trial on Tuesday that the main courtroom and an auxiliary overflow room were filled within an hour. Dozens of reporters were stranded in a hallway unable to watch the proceeding at all. Yet despite the anticipation, the trial began with a false start, Judge Cogan announcing that two of the 18 anonymous jurors needed to be dismissed. One of them, Judge Cogan said, was ""anxious and upset"" at the prospect of sitting in judgment of Mr. Guzmán, a man said to be the most notorious and feared criminal of the 21st century. The other had complained that he would suffer financial hardship from being out of work during the four-month trial. The parties broke away for an emergency jury selection session, picking two new panelists by midafternoon. Mr. Fels described the defendant as a seasoned trafficker who had ascended to the top of his cartel after getting a start growing poppies and marijuana in Sinaloa. He later made a name for himself as a speedy smuggler who worked with Colombian cartels. But Mr. Lichtman said Mr. Guzman was ""a nobody"" with ""a second-grade education"" who had for years been blamed for Mr. Zambada's wrongdoing. ""There is another side to this story,"" he told the jury."
News,2018-11-14,"Far removed from the political posturing and brinkmanship that capture most of the attention in Britain’s long and tedious departure from the European Union, Yme Pasma is deeply enmeshed in the mother of all logistical problems.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/business/brexit-flowers-britain-trade.html,1748," Far removed from the political posturing and brinkmanship that capture most of the attention in Britain's long and tedious departure from the European Union, Yme Pasma is deeply enmeshed in the mother of all logistical problems. He is the chief operating officer of Royal FloraHolland, a marketplace where some 12 billion flowers and plants are sold a year — more than one-third of the worldwide trade in such blooms. Inside hulking warehouses near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport in the town of Aalsmeer, Royal FloraHolland operates a flower auction and a distribution center. A fleet of computer-guided forklifts whisks buckets of roses, boxes of amaryllis and other foliage — some grown in Holland, some flown in from Africa, Asia and Latin America — toward loading docks, to be placed on trucks and shipped to customers worldwide. The scent of flowers is pervasive, a weirdly anomalous whiff of perfume amid the clatter of machinery. Nearly $1 billion worth of this product a year is destined for the United Kingdom, a realm that today is still part of the European Union. Flowers arriving from outside Europe can clear customs and then proceed unhindered to Britain.  But as of next March, when Britain is supposed to bid adieu in a process known as Brexit, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are set to become separate markets, divided by a newly important border.  Unless the two bickering parties in this messy divorce reach an agreement bringing about some less disruptive arrangement, goods traveling across the channel are likely to confront customs checks and sanitary inspections. Flowers now shipped duty-free may encounter tariffs. The word on Wednesday that the British government had struck an agreement in principle with European counterparts on how to proceed merely moved the conflict into the British Parliament, where the deal could be voted down or altered. The governments of the 27 remaining nations in the European bloc must bless the deal, an uncertain proposition. For people who sell goods across the channel, clarity remained distant. ""At both sides, the governments are very willing to prepare, but still you need hundreds of people, and you need to train them, and you need warehouses to do the checks, and you have to build the computer systems,"" Mr. Pasma says. ""There are going to be major traffic jams in the Netherlands. If it happens tomorrow, it's going to be a huge problem."" Women — overwhelmingly women — work in greenhouses near Lake Naivasha, northwest of Nairobi. They cut roses and place them into buckets that are trucked to the Nairobi airport, where jets ship them out to destinations across Europe and the Middle East.  An increasing flow of these roses travels directly to Britain, bypassing the traditional hub in the Netherlands. Even then, Brexit still presents a significant variable.  The European Union has a trade agreement with Kenya that enables imports of flowers free of tariffs. After Brexit, Britain will have to negotiate its own arrangement with Kenya and other exporters. Until a deal is struck, flowers sent from Kenya to Britain would stand to incur tariffs of nearly 7 percent, a potential shock for an industry that has become a major source of jobs in the East African nation. But most of the roses grown in Kenya and destined for Britain still travel toward customers on the traditional route that has dominated the flower industry for decades — through the Netherlands. Inside a glassed-in room above the warehouse floor, traders stare at banks of computers as they place bids on this rolling riot of flowers at the auction. Before making their orders, some of the traders walk down to the floor to inspect the goods, like gamblers eyeing the racehorses before the bugle.  Behind the main auction floor, 13 so-called clocks — electronic displays of trading activity — track the offers and bids in online exchanges, the participants as far away as China, Russia and the United States. The whole process depends on a continuous, unimpeded flow of goods through the vast operation. Brexit looms like a giant speed bump. It could prompt merchants to transact directly, outside the marketplace, diminishing the volume of trade at the auctions. Larger players might adapt fine, but smaller growers — who depend on the marketplace — could suffer declining demand.  Mr. Pasma is exploring the possibility of separating the flow of flowers into different streams: those that land at Amsterdam and are destined for buyers within Europe, requiring no change to the current system; others that are bound for post-Brexit Britain, and might need to be set aside for new, as-yet-unspecified administrative procedures.  He is hoping he can persuade European and British authorities to institute whatever checks would be required right here, preventing delays. ""You have to get the product across the channel quickly,"" he says. On the warehouse floor, forklift operators don headsets and await instructions from the computer in charge. The computer reads chips on every cart that identify the product and the buyer, telling the drivers where to go. The drivers affix their gear to the carts and join the flow of traffic, hewing to lanes demarcated across the floor.  It's a precision operation. Many flowers have been plucked from cargo jets that have landed within the hour. European customs agents clear the goods on the premises. Ditto, health authorities. Flowers destined for Britain are either carried by truck through the tunnel underneath the English Channel or dropped at ports in the Netherlands and ferried across the water to England.  Here is where Brexit provokes the most concern. ""This is going to be a huge problem in the infrastructure in our nation,"" says Mr. Pasma. The Dutch Flower Group imports some 350 million euros a year (about $400 million) into the United Kingdom, roughly half from the Netherlands. In recent months, the company's chief financial officer, Harry Brockhoff, has met with British and European officials to urge them to maintain the status quo.  If Britain hangs on to European rules, he argues, then flowers crossing the channel should require no additional checks. If it doesn't, the British government will need to rebuild the capacity it had before it entered what is now known as the European Union in 1973, resuming its own customs and so-called phytosanitary checks of the flowers.  Both the British and European governments have signaled designs to streamline health and safety checks to head off post-Brexit problems. ""There is no certainty, so we have to prepare for the worst,"" says Mr. Brockhoff. ""But I am hopeful that everybody wants to come to a decent solution."" Well before dawn, florists across southern England arrive to select their stock. So do designers who create floral arrangements for hotels and offices. So do wedding planners and funeral homes. The market is the largest wholesale source of flowers in Britain. Roughly 80 percent come from the Netherlands. The original Covent Garden market, in central London, was where Eliza Doolittle worked as a flower seller when she met Henry Higgins in ""My Fair Lady."" These days, merchants at the market view the approach of the official Brexit date with a growing sense of concern. ""I'm dreading that a little bit, that we will have aggravation getting our stuff in,"" says Dennis Edwards, owner of one wholesale outlet. He excuses himself to take a call from a florist — Prince Charles's florist, he notes — who is on the prowl for a special variety of gerbera known as pasta, because it is shaped something like fusilli. In pursuit, Mr. Edwards has been on the phone with his agent in the Netherlands, who is monitoring the auctions. At 69, Mr. Edwards is accustomed to this sort of clientele. He procured flowers for Princess Diana's funeral, and for the memorial ceremony inside St. Paul's Cathedral after the terrorists attacks of Sept. 11. From where he stands — in the midst of roses of every conceivable tint — Brexit amounts to a historical step backward. ""I'm old enough to remember how it was before,"" he says, meaning when British customs would inspect shipments arriving at the English port of Dover from the Dutch shipping hub at Rotterdam. ""We'd be waiting for a consignment of orchids from Singapore and they'd find one insect and condemn the whole lot,"" he says. He would find himself uttering expensive words to his customers: ""Sorry we've let you down."" He frets that Brexit could make these words commonplace again.  ""If someone's doing a hotel at 5 in the morning and the flowers don't get there until 8, it just messes everything up,"" he says. ""The Dutch still want to serve us, and we still want to buy their product. But nobody knows what will happen. We're all just in the dark."" This is the fear of Mary Woolcot, who owns a flower shop in the London neighborhood of Kennington. She designs arrangements for weddings and corporate events. She makes early-morning trips to the New Covent Garden Market, where she buys flowers from Mr. Edwards, among other suppliers. The Brexit vote in June 2016 sent the British pound plummeting against the euro, making goods more expensive. That has made customers thriftier, with her sales down by about 15 percent ever since. ""People aren't buying as much as they used to,"" she says. Many of her corporate customers are in Canary Wharf, a district of old docklands transformed into a global banking center. Brexit has already prompted finance jobs to be shifted to Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris, which translates into less demand for flowers. But the real threat is political, she says. The Europeans want to teach Britain a lesson for abandoning the bloc. The terms of trade that emerge will not be favorable, she says — not for her business, and not for Britain. Anyone who thinks otherwise is ""in cloud cuckoo land,"" she says. Putting on a wedding is challenging enough, she says. She wants the freshest flowers, so she places her orders at the wholesale market no more than one or two days before the ceremony. That leaves little margin for error. If anything goes awry, the consequences can quickly yield a fiasco. ""For a wedding, you only have one crack,"" Ms. Woolcot says. ""It's got to be perfect."" Brexit could go a lot of ways yet, but most of them look short of perfect. ""There's going to be delays,"" says Ms. Woolcot. ""Where are we going to get our stuff?"""

News,2018-11-14,"The nation’s hospitals have been merging at a rapid pace for a decade, forming powerful organizations that influence nearly every health care decision consumers make.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/health/hospital-mergers-health-care-spending.html,1840," The nation's hospitals have been merging at a rapid pace for a decade, forming powerful organizations that influence nearly every health care decision consumers make. The hospitals have argued that consolidation benefits consumers with cheaper prices from coordinated services and other savings. But an analysis conducted for The New York Times shows the opposite to be true in many cases. The mergers have essentially banished competition and raised prices for hospital admissions in most cases, according to an examination of 25 metropolitan areas with the highest rate of consolidation from 2010 through 2013, a peak period for mergers. The analysis showed that the price of an average hospital stay soared, with prices in most areas going up between 11 percent and 54 percent in the years afterward, according to researchers from the Nicholas C. Petris Center at the University of California, Berkeley. The new research confirms growing skepticism among consumer health groups and lawmakers about the enormous clout of the hospital groups. While most political attention has focused on increased drug prices and the Affordable Care Act, state and federal officials are beginning to look more closely at how hospital mergers are affecting spiraling health care costs. During the Obama years, the mergers received nearly universal approval from antitrust agencies, with the Federal Trade Commission moving to block only a small fraction of deals. State officials generally looked the other way. President Trump issued an executive order last year calling for more competition, saying his administration would focus on ""limiting excessive consolidation throughout the health care system."" In September, Congress asked the Medicare advisory board to study the trend. But not only have big consolidations continued, the behemoths have further cemented their reach in some regions of the country by gobbling up major doctors' and surgeons' practices. ""You have to watch for these systems throwing their weight around,"" said Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general whose office has sued Sutter Health, a sprawling system in the northern part of the state. ""We are looking for cases where consolidation does nothing for efficiency and leads to distortions of the market."" Ted Doolittle, who heads Connecticut's Office of the Healthcare Advocate, has fielded angry complaints from residents, but he sees few options available to officials. ""A lot of this is too little and too late,"" he said. The latest giant hospital consolidations continue to stir concerns. Dignity Health and Catholic Health Initiatives, two large chains, are expected to become one of the nation's largest groups — with 139 hospitals in 28 states — by the end of the year. And two of Texas' biggest systems, Baylor Scott & White Health and Memorial Hermann Health System, recently announced plans to combine. The New Haven area has witnessed the most significant decline in competition. Yale New Haven Health, one of the largest hospital groups in Connecticut, took over the only competing hospital in the city and has also aggressively expanded along the state's coast. The group recently added another hospital to its collection, merging Milford with its Bridgeport location. Although the price of a hospital admission in the New Haven-Milford area was already three times higher than in other parts of the state, prices surged by 25 percent from 2012 to 2014, compared with 7 percent elsewhere in the state, according to the Petris Center. In the national analysis, a third of the metropolitan areas experienced increases in the cost of hospital stays of at least 25 percent from 2012 to 2014, from roughly $12,000 to at least $15,000. Prices rise even more steeply when these large hospital systems buy doctors' groups, according to Richard Scheffler, director of the Petris Center. ""It's much more powerful when they already have a very large market share,"" said Mr. Scheffler, who recently published a study on the issue in Health Affairs. ""The impact is just enormous."" Thousands of Connecticut residents were stranded without a local hospital last year when another big hospital group, Hartford HealthCare, battled the state's biggest health insurer over how much it would charge for patient care. Its six hospitals are clustered around the state capital and are the only resort for residents in broad swaths of the eastern part of the state. This month, it announced plans to add a seventh hospital to its network. ""These systems are empire-building, there's no question,"" said Jill Zorn, a senior policy officer for the Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut, which seeks to improve access for residents. ""But to whose benefit?"" Numerous studies by economists and others have underscored how hospital consolidation is driving up the cost of medical care. ""Within the academic community, there is near unanimity,"" said Zack Cooper, a health economist at Yale University who is among a group of researchers that has looked at how dominant hospitals affect prices. The emergence of a one-hospital town is inevitable in many places, and the Parkersburg, W.Va., area is no exception. St. Joseph's merged with neighboring Camden-Clark Memorial in 2011, and then they were consumed by what is now the state's largest health system. ""We've got it down to a single campus,"" said Albert L. Wright Jr., the chief executive of West Virginia University Health System. ""Parkersburg is not big enough to support two hospitals."" Residents can get most care locally but they go to Morgantown, where the academic medical center is situated, for complex conditions. ""We've elevated the level of care,"" Mr. Wright said. But private insurers are paying more. In the Parkersburg-Vienna area, the overall price of a hospital stay increased 54 percent from 2012 to 2014, after the mergers. That is compared with 10 percent elsewhere in the state, according to the Petris Center. Large systems ""get paid better by some of the insurers,"" Mr. Wright said. Flailing hospitals often have little choice but to be acquired or go out of business, and a larger system can offer badly needed capital and management skills. ""They can fix a hospital and benefit the community,"" said Torrey McClary, a lawyer who specializes in mergers at King & Spalding. When Yale New Haven Health took over the Hospital of Saint Raphael, a Catholic hospital six blocks away from its New Haven location, Saint Raphael was in danger of going under. Over the last six years, the system has invested more than $200 million in capital improvements at Saint Raphael, said its president Richard D'Aquila, including modernizing ""everything behind the walls."" Because it converted Saint Raphael into what is essentially a second 555-bed campus for its academic medical center, Yale New Haven Health defends the higher rates it charges private insurers as appropriate for a top-tier medical institution. Its community hospitals negotiate prices individually with insurers. ""Our focus is not on getting bigger,"" Mr. D'Aquila said. He said Saint Raphael, which was half empty when it was taken over, is now seeing record numbers of patients. Systems also say they are trying to improve the care for smaller communities. ""We're actively trying to move care toward places that are accessible,"" Hartford's chief executive, Elliot Joseph, said. But patients rarely reap the rewards of lower insurance premiums or out-of-pocket expenses when mergers occur. Hartford executives talk about reducing the total cost of care in the same breath that they discuss the need to charge insurers more. ""The math for us is how we move the care out of the hospitals while maintaining our financial stability,"" Mr. Joseph said. To defend higher rates, many hospitals cite low reimbursements from government sources, particularly Medicaid, and highlight their role as a safety net. ""We're left with no choice,"" Mr. D'Aquila said. Others, like Hartford, negotiate prices as a single entity, forcing health insurers to include all of their hospitals in a network or risk losing access in areas where there are no alternatives. Hartford ""has taken over so many hospitals and practices that, with the Anthem dispute, we felt we had no choices at all,"" Sharry Goldman, a Storrs, Conn., resident, told state lawmakers. Although Hartford and Anthem Blue Cross, the insurer, eventually reached an agreement, Connecticut passed a law this year requiring hospitals and insurers to extend previous contracts for two months to protect consumers when the parties are at an impasse. While patients may pay more for a well-known brand, like Yale, it is not clear that the higher price tags lead to better care, said Francois de Brantes, a health care executive who once worked at General Electric, which is headquartered in the state. ""We have more lower-rated hospitals in Connecticut than in other New England states,"" he said, pointing to an analysis he did at the time of the Anthem-Hartford dispute. In the Albany, Ga., area, where the Berkeley researchers found a rare decline in hospital prices, the Federal Trade Commission had unsuccessfully attempted to block HCA, the for-profit hospital chain, from selling its hospital to its only local competitor in 2011. But the merger took place, and the F.T.C. reached  a settlement with the parties involved. While Berkeley researchers foundarea prices dropped, another study by two former F.T.C. employees, Christopher Garmon and Laura Kmitch, found that certain hospital quality measures declined. The merger ""highlights the problems that can occur when competition is reduced,"" the authors said. The hospital group, Phoebe Putney Health System, dismissed the findings. ""Phoebe has made great strides in enhancing the quality of health care available to the people of southwest Georgia,"" Dawn Benson, Phoebe's general counsel, said in a statement. To foster competition, Lee County is planning a new 60-bed hospital within the Albany area. In some cases, state regulators have opposed actions they consider illegal and anti-competitive. In Washington, state officials accused CHI Franciscan Health, based in Tacoma, of using its ties to two doctors' practices to raise prices and decrease competition on the Kitsap Peninsula, according to a lawsuit filed last year. The regulators argue that CHI wanted to wield its newfound clout by shifting some operations and imaging from less expensive outpatient settings to hospitals where they could charge more. ""I am all for taking advantage of hospital-based pricing, if we think it is doable in the market and the market can support it,"" a CHI executive is quoted as saying in the lawsuit. ""It would be great to drop a couple of million more to our bottom line."" CHI Franciscan said the attorney general's allegations were ""misguided and unfounded."" In California, Mr. Becerra, the state attorney general, brought a lawsuit against Sutter in March, claiming that its actions led to significantly higher prices in Northern California. Sutter says it adopted methods encouraged by the federal health care law, by combining hospital services with care delivered outside the hospital to better meet patients' needs. But Mr. de Brantes, the health care executive in Connecticut, and others wonder why many mergers were allowed in the first place. ""The puzzling part for many of us in the state is why anyone would allow these oligopolies to form,"" he said."
Review,2018-11-14,LATINX The New Force in American Politics and Culture By Ed Morales 368 pp. Verso. $24.95.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/books/review/latinx-ed-morales.html,1075," LATINX The New Force in American Politics and Culture By Ed Morales 368 pp. Verso. $24.95. In September, just in time for Hispanic Heritage Month, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary recognized the word ""Latinx,"" which it defines as ""of, relating to or marked by Latin American heritage — used as a gender-neutral alternative to Latino or Latina."" I was happy to see the addition, and also more than a little amused. I thought back to my freshman year of college in 1992. As I sat in a computer room in my dorm working away on an early Macintosh, a red squiggly line immediately appeared underneath the word ""Chicano"" after I typed it into the paper I was writing about my family's background. When I hit the spell check to see what the problem was, Microsoft Word had a suggestion: Chicago. ""You don't even exist,"" popped into my head. Unfortunately, this wasn't a new experience. Years earlier, in middle school, I'd been asked to fill out a form that included a question about my background. There were three options to choose from: black, white or other. ""Well, I'm not black or white,"" I remember thinking, pencil in hand, ""but I don't like the sound of 'other.'"" I left it blank. For many Latinos, stories like these are all too familiar. In ""Latinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture,"" Ed Morales fills in that blank as well as the long, painful, complex and intersectional struggle for identity that has shaped America's Latino community. As Morales notes, Latinx is just the latest in a series of terms, from Hispanic to Latino/a and even Latin@, employed to refer to individuals of Latin American heritage in an inclusive way. Reading Morales's dissection of Latinx identity formation, however, one begins to believe that the x in ""Latinx"" is more than just a means of providing gender-neutrality. As in algebra, the x is variable. How a Latino or Latina perceives himself or herself — and how he or she is perceived by others — often depends on context. Unhappy with the binary notion of race popular in the United States, Morales offers the concept of mestizaje, or hybridity, that encompasses a spectrum of identity, the result of hundreds of years of intermixing among African, European and indigenous peoples in Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean. Latinos can be black, white, brown or anything in between. Skin color, national origin, whether one lives in the mainland United States or outside of it, and one's ability to speak Spanish, not to mention gender and sexual orientation, all play a role in one's self-concept. Morales, an adjunct faculty member at Columbia University who describes his own identity as that of a ""racialized person living in a U.S. megacity, who has a somewhat ambiguous phenotypical appearance,"" proves refreshingly introspective, weaving enough personal biography into the book to pull the work back from veering too far into inaccessible academic jargon. ""In my own extended family, there is generally a disdain for blackness,"" he writes, and tells of his father, who ""traded on Anglo-Americans' perceptions of his whiteness if it helped him in financial or social transactions, yet sought to avoid complete identification with whiteness when it came to his 'real' identity."" According to the 2010 census, there were 55 million Latinos in the United States, and they made up 23 percent of Americans under the age of 18. Today, although Asian-Americans are now growing more quickly in percentage terms, Latinos are still growing fastest numerically. That means the destiny of the United States and the destiny of the Latino community are powerfully intertwined. ""The American identity will never be fixed and final; it will always be in the making,"" Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote a quarter century ago in ""The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society."" While Schlesinger's observation may be true, it is much easier asserted than accepted. With his boogeyman approach to electoral politics, Donald Trump has deftly exploited anxieties about the impact of America's changing demographics on our national identity, and no group has been more vilified by Trump for political purposes than Latinos. After declaring in his announcement speech that Mexico was sending rapists and drug runners to our country, months later Trump dismissed questions about the legitimacy of fraud claims against Trump University by insisting that the American-born judge of Mexican descent who was presiding over the case could not do his job right because ""he's Mexican!"" His administration has been even worse, cruelly separating families apprehended at the Southern border, failing to adequately respond to Hurricane Maria and then dismissing the deaths of 3,000 Puerto Ricans as mere fantasy concocted by political opponents. It is no surprise, then, that the Latino community is widely misperceived and is especially in need today of voices to defend and humanize it. In this way, ""Latinx"" couldn't be timelier. For one thing, Morales shatters Americans' view of the community as monolithic. Although nearly two-thirds of Latinos claim Mexican heritage, Puerto Ricans, Cubans and a growing community of Latinos from Central and South America each have unique cultural and political experiences in the United States. Morales explores these to varying degrees, and, importantly, makes clear that Latinos have been integral to America's progress for generations, even as they have grappled with relative invisibility, outright rejection of their place in America and internal struggles about their own identity. He reminds us that it was Gonzalo and Felícitas Méndez, the Mexican-born father and Puerto Rican mother of daughter Sylvia Mendez, who challenged California's separate and unequal ""Mexican schools,"" winning an appellate court victory in 1946 that paved the way for the Supreme Court's opinion in Brown v. Board of Education that struck down racial segregation in schools eight years later. Morales's writing can be hyperbolic at times. ""For an American economy that has been largely stagnant, the opening of Cuba is a last-ditch opportunity to stave off looming worldwide economic disaster,"" he writes of President Obama's efforts to open up Cuba to American investment. Still, the book's deep dive into the crosscurrents of Latinx identity is a powerful reminder that, as Americans wrestle with questions about who is and who is not ""American"" — and, indeed, questions about what it means to be an American in the 21st century — the nation can benefit immensely from the robust inclusion and understanding of a community that has spent generations grappling with nearly every facet of its own identity."
News,2018-11-14,"Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet approved a draft agreement on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union during an emergency meeting on Wednesday, a crucial and perilous step, as the time left to strike a final deal runs short.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/world/europe/brexit-britain-eu-deal.html,2054," Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet approved a draft agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union during an emergency meeting on Wednesday, a crucial and perilous step, as the time left to strike a final deal runs short. Cabinet support relieves some of the pressure on Mrs. May, who has struggled for months to meet competing demands over the withdrawal, commonly known as Brexit, which is scheduled to occur on March 29. ""The choices before us were difficult, particularly in relation to northern Ireland backstop, but the collective decision of Cabinet was that government should agree the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration,"" she said in a short statement. ""This is a decisive step."" Before the meeting Wednesday, hard-line advocates of Brexit had tried to persuade the full cabinet to reject the draft agreement, or to resign in protest. Either outcome would have been devastating for Mrs. May. • There are still several steps before the agreement could take effect. The deal needs the approval of the British Parliament, which is far from a certainty. The European Parliament and the bloc's 27 other member states would also have to approve it. • A key sticking point is the Irish border. Negotiators are trying to find a way to allow people and goods to pass through without the imposition of border controls. Even before the cabinet met, the backlash was well underway, with hard-line Conservatives and members of opposition parties alike condemning the plan in statements, television interviews and debate in Parliament. Critics on both left and right argue that the deal would leave Britain subject to European Union rules, but without any say in making those rules. They are also alarmed that Britain would not have a unilateral right to quit the temporary customs union. On the floor of Parliament, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, traded barbs with Prime Minister Theresa May, but she refused to be drawn into offering any details of the agreement. ""From what we know the government's deal is a failure in its own terms,"" Mr. Corbyn said. ""It doesn't deliver a Brexit for the whole country. It breaches the prime minister's own red lines."" Mrs. May retorted that the Labour Party had ""only one intention, and that is to frustrate Brexit and betray the vote of the British people."" Mrs. May's former Brexit secretary, David Davis, described the deal on Twitter as ""EU domination, imprisonment in the customs union and 2nd class status,"" adding that ""Cabinet and all Conservative MPs should stand up, be counted and say no to this capitulation."" Jacob Rees-Mogg, a hard-core Brexit supporter, told the BBC that the proposed deal was ""a failure of the government's negotiating position and a failure to deliver."" Mr. Corbyn, along with the leaders of the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Welsh party Plaid Cymru, released a letter demanding that Parliament not only vote on the deal, but that it also be allowed to consider amendments. An up-or-down vote on the negotiated agreement, Mr. Corbyn said, would be ""a false choice before Parliament between her botched deal and no deal."" — STEPHEN CASTLE and RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA The prime minister's Conservative Party does not have a majority in Parliament, so her government relies on Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which voiced opposition to the deal even before it was made public. The D.U.P.'s leader, Arlene Foster, made clear in her statement late Tuesday that she was not happy with the emerging deal. Jeffrey Donaldson, a senior D.U.P lawmaker, went further, telling the BBC on Wednesday that what he had heard of the draft Brexit deal ""undermines the constitutional and economic integrity"" of the United Kingdom, and warning that he was not afraid of precipitating a general election by opposing the plan. The most delicate aspect of the plan is the so-called backstop to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union. From what is known of the draft, Britain would stay temporarily in a customs union with the European Union until a long-term trade deal is negotiated. But the obligations on Northern Ireland would be deeper, particularly in obeying standards laid down by the European Union's single market, leading to increased regulatory checks on goods flowing from Britain to Northern Ireland. That is seen as an almost existential threat by the D.U.P., which wants to remain part of the United Kingdom. For the D.U.P., voting against Mrs. May's deal risks precipitating a general election that could bring Jeremy Corbyn, the opposition Labour Party leader, to power. Mr. Corbyn has a history of strong ties to Sinn Fein, which promotes a united Ireland. — STEPHEN CASTLE Rest in peace, ""no deal is better than a bad deal."" Long live compromise. Mrs. May is not generally seen as a stealthy political operator, but Wednesday signaled a sharp reversal of the pledge that has been her Brexit mantra. For nearly two years, she has repeatedly assured the country that ""no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain."" This promise — that she would walk away rather than compromise Britain's interests — helped her keep the allegiance of hard-line Brexiteers in her own party, while conveying to Brussels that it should give a little, to prevent a chaotic exit. It projected such confidence that the pound rose sharply in the hours after she first articulated it. But on Wednesday, it appeared that Mrs. May's message had been a bluff. It has been replaced by the opposite logic, conveyed in the most urgent terms: A compromise with the European Union — a package of wins and losses — is better than no deal. Economists and business leaders have warned that an abrupt, ""cliff edge"" Brexit, without an agreement to take the place of membership, could have disastrous consequences for Britain, including shortages of food and other goods and sudden price increases. Moderate voices have long urged compromise as the only sensible solution. But by adopting the language of her party's euroskeptic right wing for so long, Mrs. May ran the risk of a last-minute explosion. For Brexiteers, this deal has less to do with practical consequences than with passion and principle. Mrs. May's adamant words made them bolder. If they feel they have been tricked, she could pay the price. — ELLEN BARRY Corporate Britain has so far shown a mixed response to the Brexit plan. Business leaders want a stable, predictable environment, and are divided on whether the proposed deal can provide it. ""Businesses that crave certainty and detail will have heard very little in recent days to make them feel they can now relax,"" James Stewart, the head of Brexit at the consulting firm KPMG, told Bloomberg News. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said in an emailed statement: ""This is a welcome step towards a deal, as retailers urgently need certainty as we approach the date of the U.K.'s departure from the E.U."" The Financial Times reported that some business leaders were invited to Downing Street on Tuesday, as Mrs. May briefed her cabinet on the proposed deal. ""It looks to me this is the only deal in town,"" Jürgen Maier, the chief executive of Siemens U.K., told Reuters. ""I think it is better to get behind it, maybe fine tune it a little bit and make it work."" — JAMIE CONDLIFFE The morning news shows were full of lawmakers promising that the draft deal was dead on arrival, but one indicator to the contrary came from an unlikely quarter. Sarah Vine, who writes a column in The Daily Mail, responded to the bluster with a sardonic eye-roll, remarking on Twitter: ""On the whole quite a lot of willy waving going on this morning #Brexitdeal."" To understand why Ms. Vine's throwaway line matters, one must understand the incestuous nature of British politics in general, and the Brexit drama in particular. [Read about the clubby, old-school world of Britain's Conservative upper echelons.] Aside from being a columnist for a powerful pro-Brexit tabloid, Ms. Vine is married to Michael Gove, a leading Brexiteer and member of Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet, and her remark seemed like confirmation that he would support the deal, propelling it toward a Parliament vote. It was another reminder that family ties — and conflicts — are a central organizing principle of Britain's elite. Last week, Jo Johnson, who opposed Brexit, resigned from the cabinet rather than back the compromise deal, which he warned would lead to ""vassalage."" His older brother, Boris Johnson, left the cabinet over the compromise deal, but for the opposite reason: He is a standard-bearer of the Conservatives' hard Brexit faction. Their sister Rachel Johnson, a Daily Mail columnist, left the Conservative Party in 2017 because she opposed Brexit. Their brother Leo Johnson opposes Brexit and supports a second referendum. After a complicated flurry of intra-family retweeting, Ms. Johnson remarked, ""Maybe way to settle this matter once and for all is to spare the country another one and simply have a referendum in the Johnson family."" — ELLEN BARRY Brussels was tracking events in London nervously, concerned about whether Mrs. May can get the deal through her cabinet and the Parliament — and what would follow if she could not. In European Union offices, there is a general but unfocused hope that somehow Britain will reverse itself and remain in the European fold, presumably through a second referendum. But there is also deep fatigue, even annoyance, with the whole issue, which other member nations believe has diverted attention from pressing problems like migration, conflict with Russia, potential trade war with the United States, populist dissension within the bloc, and European elections next spring. As the British cabinet met Wednesday afternoon, ambassadors of the other 27 nations of the European Union were also be briefed on the draft deal. The agreement would have to be ratified by the leaders of the member nations, and by the European Parliament. The hope is that the European Union can hold a special Brexit summit meeting before the end of November to win approval for the agreement and the accompanying nonbinding political declaration. Britain is scheduled to leave the union on March 29. Leaks about the draft agreement have concentrated on the issue of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The resolution reportedly means Britain must adhere to European Union rules while no longer having a vote on them, an arrangement that critics have called ""vassalage."" But from the point of view of the bloc — a creature of rules, laws and regulations — anything that undercuts the single market is unacceptable, including competition on tariffs and regulations from a nonmember, as Britain soon may be. If the agreement wins final approval in Britain, the two sides must still negotiate a long-term deal on their future trading relationship. — STEVEN ERLANGER Beyond breaking Britain away from the rest of the European Union, Brexit also poses a growing risk of breaking up the country. Voters in Scotland rejected independence in a bitterly contested 2014 referendum, but separatism remains a potent force in Scottish politics. In 2016, Scotland voted by a wide margin, 62 percent to 38 percent, to remain in the European Union, while Britain as a whole voted to leave, 52 percent to 48 percent. So when word leaked that Mrs. May's Brexit deal would allow Northern Ireland to maintain a close relationship to the European market, at least temporarily, Scottish nationalists saw an opening. If Northern Ireland gets a separate deal, they asked, why shouldn't Scotland? Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National Party, tore into the deal in Parliament on Wednesday. ""To protect jobs in Scotland, we must stay in the single market and the customs union,"" he said. ""The prime minister will not drag Scotland out against its will. If there is a deal to protect the economy in Northern Ireland, why not Scotland?"" — BENJAMIN MUELLER"

Amazon confirmed yesterday that it had picked New York City and Northern Virginia for its new hubs. (Nashville will get a logistics facility as a consolation prize.) But skeptics are asking whether the price tag — a combined total of $2 billion in tax credits, rebates and other incentives — was worth it. Here's what each location promised: • New York offered Amazon more than $1.2 billion in incentives, and a pledge that Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio would stop bickering long enough to see the project through. The city also agreed to a helipad for Jeff Bezos. • Virginia promised about $800 million in incentives (and the all-important helipad, too). It also rebranded the neighborhoods that will host Amazon's office as ""National Landing."" Officials from each location said that Amazon's offices would create at least 25,000 jobs. But critics say the incentives set a worrying precedent: Bryce Covert writes in an NYT Op-Ed that other companies will now expect similarly extravagant windfalls in exchange for offices. And some local politicians have already publicly opposed the plan. Meanwhile, Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion thinks Amazon may have outsmarted itself: ""The year of hoopla during a period of deepening anxiety about powerful technology companies means there will be more attention on whether Amazon is a good corporate citizen."" More tech job news: Amazon and Google are in a race to hire software developers. British and European Union officials reached a long-awaited draft agreement yesterday over Britain's withdrawal from the bloc. Now comes the hard part. At 2 p.m. today (9 a.m. Eastern), Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain will meet with senior cabinet ministers to assess the plans. They reviewed the draft text overnight, though the details haven't been made public. Getting to this point has not been easy, and it involved months of labored discussions — particularly about contentious issues like the Irish border. But Stephen Castle of the NYT points out how pivotal today's meeting is: The presentation of the draft agreement is a moment of truth for Mrs. May, who is desperate to avoid a chaotic and disorderly ""no-deal"" Brexit. But she cannot be assured of support from hard-line Brexiteers in her cabinet, whom she may need to face down. If the deal is rejected today, Mrs. May's leadership could hang in the balance. If it passes, it still requires approval by E.U. officials at a meeting in Brussels later this month — and would then be subject to a highly unpredictable Parliament vote. Follow how events play out today in the NYT's live briefing. More Brexit news: The departure could leave wedding bouquets stuck at the British border. But the supercar manufacturer McLaren is, unusually, increasing production capacity in Britain. The price of oil continued to slide this morning, with Brent crude hitting $65 a barrel in London after falling 6.6 percent yesterday. There may be some technical trading issues at work here. But fundamentally, the markets worry that there's too much oil. ""When you put all these ingredients together, you have a recipe that's not really conducive to an $85 market environment,"" Michael Cohen, an oil analyst at Barclays, told the FT. Oil's drop has already had an effect on the stock markets, with energy stocks dragging down the S&P 500 yesterday, and that could worsen today. But there's one potential upside for investors: Falling oil prices and a strengthening U.S. dollar may convince the Fed to pause its interest rate increases. Jay Powell discusses the U.S. and the global economy. A Q. and A. with the Fed chairman, organized by the Dallas Fed (watch it here at 6 p.m. Eastern), could provide hints about the central bank's future monetary policy. The Labor Department publishes October consumer price data. The Consumer Price Index rose by just 0.1 percent in September, suggesting that inflation was being kept in check. Analysts anticipate a 0.3 percent rise for October. The Japanese conglomerate will invest $3 billion in WeWork, giving the co-working start-up more money to expand — even as its losses continue to grow. SoftBank's new cash solidifies its status as WeWork's single biggest financial backer, and gives the eight-year-old start-up a valuation of at least $42 billion. More important, it will help the company offer more desks for rent around the world. The cash comes at a crucial time: WeWork disclosed that it had lost $1.22 billion so far this year. The company says it still needs to spend on growth, but it could eventually focus on turning a profit. If, or when, it decides to go public, that could become vital. CNN filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration yesterday, arguing that its withholding of press credentials for the correspondent Jim Acosta violated the Constitution. More from Mike Grynbaum of the NYT: ""While the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta, this could have happened to anyone,"" CNN said in a statement. ""If left unchallenged, the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials."" The Trump administration plans to fight back. But Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment lawyer who represented the NYT during the Pentagon Papers case, told Politico, ""I can't think of anything that is likely to lead to a victory for the White House."" Yet Noah Feldman of Bloomberg Opinion says that, politically, Mr. Trump has already won by undercutting the news media. The National Defense Strategy Commission said in a report published yesterday that the ""security and well-being of the United States are at greater risk than at any time in decades."" The panel urged Congress to act: Rivals and adversaries are challenging the United States on many fronts and in many domains. America's ability to defend its allies, its partners, and its own vital interests is increasingly in doubt. If the nation does not act promptly to remedy these circumstances, the consequences will be grave and lasting. The commission noted that authoritarian nations like China and Russia were seeking ""the means to project power globally,"" and added that ""the proliferation of advanced technology is allowing more actors to contest U.S. military power in more threatening ways."" Its report suggested a number of priorities for Congress. Its conclusion: ""Innovations in operational concepts and leap-ahead technologies are vital to sustaining U.S. military advantages"" in the long term.

Designed in 1940 by the father of the current owner, the 12,900-square-foot house sits on a 0.78-acre lot that includes landscaped gardens, a tennis court and an L-shaped swimming pool. With limestone walls, ceramic tile floors and wood trim, the home is distinctly Mediterranean, but with stylistic influences from the prewar modernist movement and from older cave houses common to the region, said Ana Agramunt, an agent with Lucas Fox International Properties, which has the listing.  Behind a large wooden gate, a stone pathway leads to the front door (and continues around the side of the house to the tennis court). The door, framed by an arch filled in with metal scrollwork, opens into a vaulted foyer lined with tall windows. The main living room beyond has a wood-burning fireplace suspended from the ceiling and a dining area at one end with a curved wall of glass doors that open out to a covered terrace. The formal dining room has arched doorways and a traditional Catalan ceiling, with plain bricks forming a slightly arced vault. Glass doors open into a room lined with windows and built-in shelving, which has been used variously as a library and an office, Ms. Agramunt said. A geometric ceramic mural by the Spanish ceramist and sculptor Enric Mestre adorns the corridor connecting the dining room and the kitchen. The kitchen, designed for service rather than gathering, has a stainless-steel prep area, a large wine refrigerator, an induction cooktop and integrated appliances that match the sleek cabinetry, Ms. Agramunt said. A staff bedroom and guest bath are also on the ground floor, along with a second sitting room with wood paneling and an accordion door that can be pulled across to close off the space. The second floor has three en suite bedrooms, as well as a smaller guest suite with a terrace overlooking the garden. Each of the main suites has a private balcony overlooking the swimming pool, giving the house a staggered facade. A winding staircase climbs through the center of the house to a third-floor garret.  The property is close to the center of Paterna and a few minutes' walk from a metro station, shops and restaurants, Ms. Agramunt said. The coastal city of Valencia, about five miles east, is one of Spain's premier tourist attractions, with historic cathedrals, miles of Mediterranean beachfront and cultural centers like the City of Arts and Sciences, a complex of museums, entertainment halls and green spaces designed by Santiago Calatrava and Félix Candela. Valencia Airport is about a 20-minute drive from the house. Spain's residential market has been on a gradual rebound since around 2012, when luxury properties began to recover following the global recession, said Kate Everett-Allen, head of international residential research for the real estate agency Knight Frank. During the financial crisis that began in 2008, home prices fell 30 to 35 percent across the country, she said, noting that they have since risen by about 8 percent overall, although prices in Madrid and Barcelona have recovered more rapidly. The recovery is expected to continue, with the International Monetary Fund predicting that Spain's economy will outperform those of Germany and France in 2018, Ms. Everett-Allen said. In Valencia, third-quarter sale prices averaged about 1,900 euros a square meter (or about $200 a square foot) this year, according to data from Lucas Fox. Old Town, a historic neighborhood known for its winding streets, Central Market and medieval cathedral, is one of the most popular areas with tourists and foreign buyers. A typical two-bedroom apartment there sells for around 300,000 euros (or about $340,000), while a two-bedroom penthouse in a fully restored building can go for around 500,000 euros ($565,000), said Miguel Angel Cantos, the general manager of the Valencia office of Engel & Völkers. Foreign buyers are also interested in seaside properties, Mr. Cantos said, although they often prefer the beach areas just outside city limits, where more property is available and there is more new construction. While prices vary depending on location, a two-bedroom apartment in these areas generally goes for 250,000 to 500,000 euros ($280,000 to $565,000), he said.  For foreign buyers, the appeal of Valencia — Spain's third largest city, with a population of roughly 790,000 — lies in its affordability and manageable size relative to Madrid and Barcelona, as well as the access to a historic city center and Mediterranean beaches, said Conor Wilde, the owner of Found Valencia, an agency that specializes in working with international clients. ""You can get from one side of the city to the other in 15 minutes,"" he said. ""And for people who don't want the typical holiday resort, this has more of a cultural and elegant feel."" Foreign buyers account for roughly 10 percent of all sales in Valencia, according to the Registrars of Spain. About a third of sales through Lucas Fox this year have involved foreign buyers, almost half of whom were either American or British, said Carrie Frais, the agency's director of international public relations. The rest were from Latin America, Asia and other European countries, she said. The country's Golden Visa program grants non-Europeans ""the fast-track right to residency"" if they invest at least 500,000 euros ($565,000) in real estate, Mr. Wilde said. There are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Spain. But buyers from outside the country are strongly advised to work closely with a real estate agent and a lawyer who will perform the necessary due diligence, Mr. Wilde said. Taxes and fees, including legal fees and the 10 percent transfer tax, typically amount to around 15 percent of the sale price. The real estate agent's commission in Valencia is usually 4 to 5 percent, and is split between buyer and seller, Mr. Wilde said. Mortgages are available to foreigners, although typically not for more than 70 percent of the sale price, and less than that for investment properties, Mr. Cantos said.

News,2018-11-14,"In 2003, Craig Nevill-Manning, a computer scientist at Google, wanted to set up an engineering outpost in New York. Google’s top leaders were skeptical, but they told him that he could go ahead if he could find 15 “Google-worthy” software developers in the city.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/new-york-tech-jobs-amazon-hq2.html,1048," In 2003, Craig Nevill-Manning, a computer scientist at Google, wanted to set up an engineering outpost in New York. Google's top leaders were skeptical, but they told him that he could go ahead if he could find 15 ""Google-worthy"" software developers in the city. ""The attitude was that pretty much all the good software engineers were in Silicon Valley,"" Mr. Nevill-Manning recalled. ""It seems crazy in retrospect."" Mr. Nevill-Manning found his developers and opened the engineering office in New York. Today, Google employs 7,000 people in the city, and more than half are engineers and technical staff. The Google story mirrors the rise and evolution of New York as a genuine tech hub — home to a deep pool of technical talent as well as sales, marketing and business expertise. And Amazon's decision to put a headquarters in the city, eventually employing more than 25,000 workers, only reinforces that trend. [Do you live or work near Amazon's proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.] ""This solidifies New York's importance and significance in tech,"" said Fred Wilson, the dean of New York's venture capital community and co-founder of Union Square Ventures. Amazon, like most big tech companies, is no stranger to New York. It already has over 2,000 workers in New York, from e-commerce marketers to cloud computing engineers. Facebook has over 2,000 New York employees, including Yann LeCun, its chief artificial intelligence scientist and a pioneer in the field. Salesforce employs more than 1,000 at its new offices in New York. And tech stalwart IBM chose the city as the headquarters for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions. Most technology work in New York has traditionally been in service of other industries. That market, too, is growing briskly as banks, retailers, advertising and consulting firms — major employers in New York — are all getting digital makeovers and hiring. Goldman Sachs, for example, employs 2,000 tech workers in New York, including data analysts, app developers, digital security and blockchain experts. Manuela Veloso, head of the machine-learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, joined JPMorgan Chase this year to lead its A.I. research team. The five companies with the most tech-related job listings in New York over the last three months on Indeed.com, the jobs listing site, are Amazon, BNY Mellon, Capgemini, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Measurements of tech sector jobs vary, depending on definitions. But the broad picture is a growing labor market for well-paying jobs. From 2010 to 2017, according to government statistics, tech sector employment grew by 53,000 in the city, or 65 percent, to an estimated 134,700. And the average salary of $147,300 in 2016, the most recent estimate available, was far higher than the citywide average of $89,100 for all private employers.

New York is growing impressively, but its tech work force, according to most analyses, is less than half and perhaps one-third that of the Bay Area. New York fairly consistently ranks second behind the Bay Area in attracting venture capital. In the third quarter, for example, investors put $5.9 billion in start-ups in the New York metropolitan area, according to figures compiled by the PwC-CB Insights MoneyTree Report. But the Bay Area, including San Francisco and Silicon Valley, took in $12.8 billion. Start-ups in the Washington, D.C. region, where Amazon plans to put another large headquarters, received $575 million in the third quarter. In the past, New York start-ups typically sold out to larger tech companies. That, too, is changing. Mr. Wilson, the venture capitalist, pointed to MongoDB, a database supplier, and Etsy, an e-commerce seller, as examples of start-ups that held out and went public in recent years. MongoDB trades at about $70 a share, compared with its initial price of $24 a share, when it went public in October 2017. Etsy, which went public at $16 a share in 2015, currently trades at about $47 a share. ""New York entrepreneurs, investors and boards are just starting to get the courage to stay independent and grow here,"" Mr. Wilson said. The rise of New York's tech sector, businesspeople and technologists agree, owes a debt to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He pushed initiatives to make the New York economy less dependent on finance and championed tech programs and education — a long-term campaign to upgrade the technical skills of the city's work force, whose progress enhanced New York's appeal to Amazon. After the financial crisis hit in 2008, Mr. Bloomberg stepped up those efforts. In 2010, his administration announced an applied sciences competition. The city solicited proposals from universities and research organizations for a new center of higher education that would focus on technology, innovation and business. The winner, announced in December 2011, was a joint plan by Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. The new institution, Cornell Tech, got underway in Manhattan in 2012, and last year moved into three buildings in its first phase of development on Roosevelt Island. There are now 300 graduate students on campus. Over the next two decades, the plan calls for two million square feet of buildings, a student population of 2,000 and hundreds of faculty. Daniel Huttenlocher, the dean of Cornell Tech, sits on Amazon's board. The prospect of new competition served as a prod — and encouragement — to both Columbia University and New York University. Columbia expanded its engineering and computer science programs, and created the Data Science Institute. N.Y.U. absorbed an engineering school, Polytechnic University, which in 2015 became N.Y.U.'s Tandon School of Engineering. N.Y.U. also took over an old, unused Metropolitan Transportation Authority building in Brooklyn, renovated it and has begun populating it with tech-fueled research ventures, starting with the Center for Urban Science and Progress. For technologists who have recently come to New York, part of its appeal is the same thing that explains why its tech sector is often overlooked: New York's huge and diverse economy, and its culture. ""Everything is tech-driven on the West Coast,"" said Jeannette Wing, who left Microsoft Research last year to become the director of Columbia's Data Science Institute. ""But the East Coast is more well rounded. It is about technology, but not just technology for its own sake."""
Op-Ed,2018-12-03,"I no longer think that anyone in America, including Donald Trump’s most loyal supporters, can afford to put off the consideration of the central question of this administration: What if Donald Trump or those closest to him were compromised by the Russians or colluded with them?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/opinion/trump-mueller-russia-investigation.html,850," I no longer think that anyone in America, including Donald Trump's most loyal supporters, can afford to put off the consideration of the central question of this administration: What if Donald Trump or those closest to him were compromised by the Russians or colluded with them? There have always been those of us on the left who viewed his presidency as compromised, asterisk-worthy if not wholly illegitimate, because of the Russian interference. A crime had been committed by Russia and Trump cheered the crime and used the loot thereof to advance his candidacy. That is clear. The Russians made repeated attempts to contact people in Trump's orbit and in some cases were able to meet with members of the team, as evidenced by the Trump Tower meeting. That is clear. Members of Trump's team were extremely interested in and eager to accept any assistance that the Russians could provide. That is clear. And since assuming office, Trump has openly attempted to obstruct justice and damage or impede the investigation into what the Russians did and whether anyone in his orbit was part of the crime. That too is clear. But for the people who support and defend Trump, this has already been absorbed and absolved. They may not like it, but they are willing to overlook it. Indeed, they are so attached to Trump that his fortunes and his fate have become synonymous with theirs. There is a spiritual linkage, a baleful bond, between the man and his minions. But what happens if the evidence that the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, uncovers reveals a direct link between Trump and the Russians? How do Trump's boosters respond? Last week, when Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the timeline and the extent of Mr. Trump's involvement in negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow, the political earth shifted. If Trump was lying to or misleading the American people about his efforts to do business in Russia while running for president and the Russians knew — and presumably had evidence — that he wasn't being completely honest and forthcoming, then he was compromised. While it is by no means clear that the Russians ever used any information that they may have had to blackmail or otherwise pressure Trump, Cohen's plea makes clear that they had the material to do just that. This brings ever more clarity to Trump's curious inclination to go soft on Russia condemnation, to take Russian President Vladimir Putin's word over that of his own intelligence agencies, and to drag his feet in acknowledging that Russia attacked our election in 2016 and may continue to do so in the future. How would Americans who support Trump now respond to evidence that Team Trump put their own personal and financial interests over the national interest? Would they break from their blind support and turn away from him and turn on him? How could they justify wearing the blinders for so long and countenancing so much? What language would they use to correct their complicity? There is a precedent in the Nixon investigation. When the evidence of wrongdoing was clear and incontrovertible, people began to peel away, tails tucked and full of shame. But that was a different time, one in which media wasn't so fractured and partisan, before the advent of social media and our current dissociable mentalities. Nixon had no propaganda arm. Trump has one. It's called Fox News. There is little daylight between the network's programming and the White House's priorities. If Trump goes down, so too does Fox, in some measure. So the network has a vested interest in defending Trump until the bitter end, and that narrative-crafting could impede an otherwise natural and normal disaffection with Trump. Furthermore, Trump does not strike me as a man amenable to contrition or one interested in the health and stability of the nation. I expect Trump to admit nothing, even if faced with proof positive of his own misconduct. There is nothing in the record to convince me otherwise. He will call the truth a lie and vice versa. I also don't think that Trump would ever voluntarily leave office as Nixon did, even if he felt impeachment was imminent. I'm not even sure that he would willingly leave if he were impeached and the Senate moved to convict, a scenario that is hard to imagine at this point. I don't think any of this gets better, even as the evidence becomes clearer. I don't believe that Trump's supporters would reverse course in the same way that Nixon's did. I don't believe that the facts Mueller presents will be considered unassailable. I don't believe Trump will go down without bringing the country down with him. In short, I don't believe we are reaching the end of a nightmare, but rather we are entering one. This will not get easier, but harder. The country is about to enter the crucible. This test of our republic is without a true comparison. And we do not have a clear picture of how the test will resolve. But, I believe damage is certain.

It was written by William B. Benton — a co-founder of the Benton & Bowles ad agency — and an editor's note explained that Benton was speaking not just for himself but on behalf of a major corporate lobbying group. The article then laid out a vision for American prosperity after World War II. At the time, almost nobody took postwar prosperity for granted. The world had just endured 15 years of depression and war. Many Americans were worried that the end of wartime production, combined with the return of job-seeking soldiers, would plunge the economy into a new slump. ""Today victory is our purpose,"" Benton wrote. ""Tomorrow our goal will be jobs, peacetime production, high living standards and opportunity."" That goal, he wrote, depended on American businesses accepting ""necessary and appropriate government regulation,"" as well as labor unions. It depended on companies not earning their profits ""at the expense of the welfare of the community."" It depended on rising wages. [Listen to ""The Argument"" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] These leftist-sounding ideas weren't based on altruism. The Great Depression and the rise of European fascism had scared American executives. Many had come to believe that unrestrained capitalism was dangerous — to everyone. The headline on Benton's article was, ""The Economics of a Free Society."" In the years that followed, corporate America largely followed this prescription. Not every executive did, of course, and management and labor still had bitter disputes. But most executives behaved as if they cared about their workers and communities. C.E.O.s accepted pay packages that today look like a pittance. Middle-class incomes rose faster in the 1950s and 1960s than incomes at the top. Imagine that: declining income inequality. And the economy — and American business — boomed during this period, just as Benton and his fellow chieftains had predicted. Things began to change in the 1970s. Facing more global competition and higher energy prices, and with Great Depression memories fading, executives became more aggressive. They decided that their sole mission was maximizing shareholder value. They fought for deregulation, reduced taxes, union-free workplaces, lower wages and much, much higher pay for themselves. They justified it all with promises of a wonderful new economic boom. That boom never arrived. Even when economic growth has been decent, as it is now, most of the bounty has flowed to the top. Median weekly earnings have grown a miserly 0.1 percent a year since 1979. The typical American family today has a lower net worth than the typical family did 20 years ago. Life expectancy, shockingly, has fallen this decade. The great stagnation of living standards is a defining problem of our time. Most families do not enjoy the ""rapidly rising level of living"" that Benton called for. Understandably, many Americans are anxious and angry. The solution will need to involve a return to higher taxes on the rich. But it's also worth thinking about pre-tax incomes — and specifically what goes on inside corporations. It's worth asking the question that Benton asked: What kind of corporate America does the rest of America need? Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, is now rolling out a platform for her almost-certain presidential campaign, and it includes an answer to this question. It is a fascinating one, because it differs from the usual Democratic agenda of progressive taxes and bigger social programs (which Warren also supports). Her idea is the most intriguing policy idea to come out of the early 2020 campaign. Warren wants an economy in which companies again invest in their workers and communities. Yet she doesn't believe it can happen organically, as it did in the 1940s, because financial markets will punish well-meaning executives who stop trying to maximize short-term profits. ""They can't go back,"" she told me recently. ""You have to do it with a rule."" She has proposed a bill in the Senate — and Ben Ray Luján, a top House Democrat, will soon offer it there — that would require corporate boards to take into account the interests of customers, employees and communities. To make sure that happens, 40 percent of a company's board seats would be elected by employees. Germany uses a version of this ""shared-governance"" model, mostly successfully. Even in today's hypercompetitive economy, German corporations earn nice profits with a philosophy that looks more like William Benton's than Gordon Gekko's. Is Warren's plan the best way to rein in corporate greed? I'm not yet sure. I want to see politicians and experts hash out her idea and others — much as they hashed out health care policy in the 2008 campaign. But I do know this: American capitalism isn't working right now. If Benton and his fellow postwar executives returned with the same ideas today, they would be branded as socialists. In truth, they were the capitalists who cared enough about the system to save it. The same goes for the new reformers. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter. "
News,2018-12-03,"GENEVA — Ten years after an international treaty banned cluster munitions, several financial institutions are slashing investment in companies that produce the weapon, according to a European organization that campaigns for a global ban.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/world/europe/firms-drop-support-for-cluster-bombs-but-global-problem-is-much-worse.html,495," GENEVA — Ten years after an international treaty banned cluster munitions, several financial institutions are slashing investment in companies that produce the weapon, according to a European organization that campaigns for a global ban. The Netherlands-based group PAX said in a report released on Monday that financial institutions it monitors had cut investment in companies that produce cluster munitions from $31 billion in 2017 to $8.7 billion in 2018 — a 72 percent decrease. Michel Uiterwaal, a co-author of the report, called the downturn a ""testament to the growing global awareness that support for this weapon is unacceptable."" But he also said that many companies not covered by the report were continuing to produce and invest in cluster munitions. ""The global problem is much worse than we describe,"" Mr. Uiterwaal said, ""because there are more producers and there's more money involved."" Cluster munitions include a wide array of bombs, rockets and artillery shells that scatter up to hundreds of smaller bomblets. Up to one-fifth of them do not detonate, leaving large expanses of land contaminated by bomblets that kill and maim civilians years after a conflict has ceased. The stigma attached to cluster munitions rose sharply with an international campaign that led to a 2008 treaty banning production, stockpiling and transfer of the weapon. The United States vigorously opposed the treaty, but 120 countries, including most NATO members, have joined the accord. The organization attributed the financial drop mostly to the decision by two major American arms manufacturers — Textron Inc. and Orbital ATK — to halt production of the weapon. Mr. Uiterwaal said those decisions at least partly reflected pressure from financial institutions that are turning their backs on funding companies that produce cluster munitions. The $8.7 billion of investment tracked by PAX went to seven companies: Avibras of Brazil, Bharat Dynamics in India, the Chinese companies China Aerospace Science and Industry and Norinco, and the South Korean companies Hanwha, LigNex1 and Poongsan. That list of producers is not exhaustive and no information is available on financing available to many other arms manufacturers producing cluster munitions, Mr. Uiterwaal said. Russia, China, India, Israel and South Korea are among states that have not joined the treaty, and the weapon has been heavily used in a number of active conflicts. United Nations investigations have reported Syrian and Russian forces using cluster munitions in the seven-year-old Syrian conflict. Human rights groups have reported the use of American, British and Brazilian-made cluster munitions by Saudi Arabia and its allies in the war in Yemen and Egypt's use of cluster bombs in the Sinai Peninsula. The United States' last known use of the weapon was in 2009. A directive issued by the George W. Bush administration the previous year said it would not use cluster bombs after 2018 unless they achieved a performance standard not met by existing stocks. Last year, however, the Pentagon reversed that commitment, arguing that cluster munitions provided ""an effective and necessary capability to engage area targets."""

Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Negotiations to start in France, a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war and the death of George Bush.  Here's the latest: • Turmoil continues in France.  The French government is considering declaring a state of emergency after a third week of violent protests against increased gasoline taxes. The demonstrations have left three people dead and hundreds more wounded. Politicians and law enforcement officials said the situation was close to an ""insurrection."" On Monday, the government will meet with representatives of the ""Yellow Vests"" protest movement and with the leaders of the opposition political parties. While the government has not signaled any intention to roll back the gas tax increase, some Yellow Vests have indicated they are ready to negotiate. Deep frustration: The anger fueling the protests in Paris has its roots in the poor rural regions of France, our Paris correspondent reports. _____ • A trade war truce, at least in the short term. Over steaks at the Group of 20 meeting in Argentina this weekend, President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, pictured above, agreed on compromises that will pause their escalating economic conflict. Mr. Trump agreed to hold off on a major increase in tariffs on Chinese goods planned for Jan. 1. Mr. Xi agreed to increase Chinese purchases of American goods. But the handshake deal was ""less a breakthrough than a breakdown averted,"" our White House correspondent writes. The two world leaders set an ambitious 90-day timeline to reach broader trade agreements, but they remain deeply divided. China also didn't give any specifics for its side of the deal, and state media quickly framed the agreement as a concession from the American president, leaving out any mention of the deadline. More from the summit: Mr. Trump dodged unsavory friends, smiled through chilly encounters and was chased by legal troubles at home. _____ • Remembering George Bush. ""I love you, too."" Those were the last words of the 41st U.S. president, above, and they were directed at the 43rd, his son. An era ended with the death of Mr. Bush, 94, on Friday. A Republican, he was the last president to have fought in World War II. He served in Congress, the U.N. and the C.I.A. before winning the White House. Though he lasted only a single term, he was a transitional figure who helped steer the country out of the Cold War. Mr. Bush will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol until Wednesday. Friends and family will gather for a memorial service on Wednesday, which Mr. Trump has designated as a national day of mourning. Mr. Bush will then be laid to rest in Texas. Mr. Bush's death has quieted a raucous political system, but the peace is unlikely to last, writes our chief White House correspondent. Read our full obituary and this remembrance by Maureen Dowd, the longtime White House correspondent, who portrays her improbable friendship with Mr. Bush as ""a screwball story."" _____ • Getting rich off detained migrant children.  As the founder and chief executive of Southwest Key, a nonprofit that houses more migrant children than any other organization in the United States, Juan Sanchez has made millions and is indispensable to the Trump administration's immigration policy. But a New York Times investigation, drawing on dozens of interviews and an examination of documents, has found a record of sloppy management and possible financial improprieties including possible self-dealing with top executives. • The global economy is slowing: Oil prices are falling, many nations are mired in stagnation or heading that way and companies are warning of disappointing profits. Our European economics correspondent thinks the mix could intensify the grievances that have contributed to the rise of populism around the world.

The actor Priyanka Chopra and the singer Nick Jonas tied the knot this weekend in the northern Indian city of Jodhpur (where your Back Story writer was born). Among the many dazzling details of the closely watched wedding was the venue: the Umaid Bhawan Palace, pictured above. Named after one of Jodhpur's kings, Maharajah Umaid Singh, the grandiose sandstone structure took 15 years to build between 1929 and 1943. Peacocks strut around its surrounding manicured gardens. Intricately carved pillars hold up its giant, jaw-dropping dome. But perhaps most remarkable is its noble origin story. It is said that the palace was built as a mass relief program employing thousands of local people when the city was hit by a crippling drought. After the Indian government de-recognized India's royal families in 1971, the palace was split into three parts: the royal residence where Mr. Singh's grandson now lives, a luxury hotel and a museum.

The Philippine government has accused the journalist, Maria Ressa, and her news organization, Rappler, of evading taxes, a move that Rappler said was part of a broader attack on the news media in the Philippines by the government of President Rodrigo Duterte. Ms. Ressa and Rappler were charged with five counts of tax fraud last week. The penalties could include a fine along with up to 10 years of imprisonment for Ms. Ressa. They have denied the charges. The government prepared a warrant for Ms. Ressa's arrest to coincide with her return to the Philippines on Sunday evening after a weekslong trip abroad that included appearances at several high-profile journalism awards ceremonies. In Washington, Ms. Ressa received the 2018 Knight International Journalism award. In New York, she was given the Press Freedom Award by the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""I'm going to hold my government accountable for publicly calling me a criminal,"" Ms. Ressa said in a brief conversation with a group of reporters who greeted her arrival at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila late Sunday. ""I am not a criminal."" On Monday morning, Ms. Ressa arrived at the Pasig Regional Trial Court in Manila and provided head shots for the court and had her fingerprints taken. Her legal team filed a motion for Ms. Ressa to be set free on bail and paid 60,000 pesos, or about $1,100, to secure her release, her lawyer said by phone. It is the latest in a series of crackdowns on the news media by the Duterte government. Mr. Duterte is one of a growing group of political strongmen who rode to power in recent years on a wave of populism in their countries and in the process tightened their grip on power. When challenged by the news media, these leaders have often turned on reporters, accusing them of being dishonest and manufacturing ""fake news."" In the Philippines, Mr. Duterte has waged an aggressive antidrug campaign that has led to the deaths of thousands of people. Local news organizations like Rappler closely documented the campaign, provoking international outcry over the killings and causing Mr. Duterte to turn his focus to the news media. He has threatened several times to block the license renewal for ABS-CBN, the largest broadcast network in the Philippines. He has called reporters ""spies"" and ""sons of bitches"" and made thinly veiled death threats, warning reporters that they are ""not exempted from assassination."" Rappler, founded in 2012 as a scrappy investigative and entertainment outlet, has been a main target of his verbal abuse. Its star political reporter, Pia Ranada, in particular has been singled out. At one news conference, Mr. Duterte warned her not to go to his hometown, Davao, where he was once mayor, because ""something bad will happen to you."" Earlier this year, Ms. Ranada was stripped of the press pass that allows her to cover Malacañang Palace, the Philippine equivalent to the White House. Rappler reporters have been barred from covering any official presidential events. Such treatment has alarmed media groups. ""More than his inability to tolerate dissent, Duterte's relentless persecution of the media appears to be part of the increasingly authoritarian direction his presidency has taken,"" the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines said in a statement on Sunday night. Rappler's newsroom has also been on the front lines of a war against misinformation on Facebook, where most Filipinos get their news. Rappler reporters have been the targets of online death and rape threats so severe that senior editors have debated installing bulletproof windows in the news organization's office. This year, Rappler became an official fact checker for Facebook, which has called the Philippines ""Patient Zero"" in the battle over misinformation. The Philippine government's case against Ms. Ressa and Rappler was brought by the country's Department of Justice and centers on a 2015 investment in Rappler by the Omidyar Network, an American organization owned by Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay. At the heart of that case is a financial transaction that is also the subject of a Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission effort this year to revoke Rappler's license to operate. The charges treat Rappler as though it were a ""dealer in securities"" and not a news organization, Ms. Ressa said, adding that Rappler has paid the right taxes required of a news organization in the Philippines. Francis Lim, a lawyer for Ms. Ressa, said Monday in a statement sent by text message, ""The police can no longer arrest her, as the court just approved the cash bail that she has posted for her liberty during the pendency of the case."" Several politicians criticized Mr. Duterte and his administration's case against Ms. Ressa on Monday. One opposition congressman, Tom Villarin, said it was ""a sure sign that the Duterte administration wants to throw this country into obscurity and darkness,"" adding that ""harassing journalists and putting critics in jail is the refuge of fascists and scoundrels."" Risa Hontiveros, an opposition senator, called the case an attempt to ""muzzle the media into fear."" ""In his attempt to be a full-fledged authoritarian, President Duterte wants to control the free flow of information and neutralize a potential channel of criticism,"" Ms. Hontiveros said in an emailed statement. Speaking on Sunday night from the airport, Ms. Ressa said that her arrest would not silence her. ""I have been a journalist my entire life,"" she said. ""I will continue to hold the government accountable."""
News,2018-12-03,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/nyregion/port-authority-bieber-bus-evicted.html,1503," [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] A financially struggling bus company was kicked out of the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan after failing to pay $214,000 in fees. But instead of shutting down, the scofflaw company found a new home at a fraction of the cost: on the curb outside. Passengers just need to walk down the street to catch Carl R. Bieber Inc. buses to the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania. The new bus stop on Eighth Avenue, near 39th Street, was approved by city transportation officials despite the objections of residents, community leaders and others who say that it crams even more buses and people (and luggage) into one of New York's most congested corridors — and essentially rewards Bieber with a prime spot. ""If you pay for something — and then you don't pay — how do you get something better?"" said Joe Tabone, the manager of a liquor store next to Bieber's stop. ""I don't think that's fair."" Bieber's curbside spot is part of what critics say is a much larger problem: a booming fleet of private buses that roll through Manhattan and pull over on streets, making New York's already bleak traffic picture even worse. Across New York, the number of bus companies with permits for curbside stops has more than tripled since 2013, to 151 from 46. Many intercity and commuter buses rely on curbside loading and unloading of passengers not only because it is cheaper for carriers, but also because they cannot all fit in the outdated Port Authority Bus Terminal. As a result, critics say, the buses are adding to choked streets at a time when traffic in Midtown Manhattan is crawling at an average of 4.7 miles per hour, among the slowest speeds of any major American city. They also say the so-called ""curbside terminals"" have blocked sidewalks and entrances to stores and other businesses and worsened air pollution. ""It is cheaper for the bus company, but city residents, workers and visitors pay a heavy price,"" said David Sandler, 39, a member of a local community board that opposed Bieber's bus stop. Across the United States, intercity bus travel is soaring. There were an estimated 61.6 million rides in 2015, up from about 45.2 million rides in 2008, fueled by the arrival and expansion of carriers such as Megabus and BoltBus that offer low fares, wireless internet and online ticketing, according to Joseph P. Schwieterman, director of the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University. Intercity bus ridership has especially thrived in the New York City region, in part as more buses offer people a wider choice of pickup and drop-off locations and significantly lower fares than trains. The city's strong job market has also drawn long-haul commuters from Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, upstate New York and elsewhere. In 2018, there were an estimated 22 million intercity bus rides in the New York City area alone, or about a million more rides than in 2014, according to Mr. Schwieterman. Buses are ""a solution to the congestion problem"" since they offer an alternative to driving, said Peter J. Pantuso, the president and chief executive of the American Bus Association, an industry group. But, he added, cities have been slow to invest in new terminals and infrastructure as they ""have identified they have challenges, but they haven't quite figured out how to address them yet."" The Port Authority, the country's busiest bus terminal, opened in 1950 in part to help reduce congestion. Today, all 186 active passenger boarding areas — spread over three floors in two buildings — are full during peak hours. A larger terminal is planned, though it is years away. For now, 18 bus companies and New Jersey Transit share the terminal. Megabus is not one of them because its double-decker buses are too tall to fit. So passengers wait to be picked up at a bus stop on the Far West Side where there is no bathroom, food court or shelter from the cold and rain. Still, they keep coming. Since the carrier started in New York in 2008, ridership has tripled, and routes have expanded to 38 cities from six. Sean Hughes, a spokesman for Megabus, said the carrier has worked to address community concerns about congestion and idling, including offering drivers bonuses for not idling. Today, there are 118 curbside bus stops in Manhattan, according to the city, of which 66 are clustered between 14th and 59th streets in neighborhoods that are already overrun with cars. In total, the Manhattan stops are used hundreds of times a day by private buses — on a recent weekday passengers were dropped off 946 times and picked up 799 times. One bus stop, on 34th Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues, has brought constant honking as buses have idled and slowed traffic, as well as piles of trash left behind by passengers, according to Pat Forbes, a cybersecurity executive who lives across the street from the stop. ""I don't think anyone has anything against buses — it's just where they're at,"" said Mr. Forbes, 58. ""They couldn't have picked a worse area if they tried.'' Christine Berthet, a member of a Midtown Manhattan community board, said bus companies all want to be near the Port Authority and Pennsylvania Station, but sometimes can be persuaded to go farther away where there is more room. But even that is no longer the best solution. ""We have run out of spots,"" she said. Bieber buses rolled into the Port Authority in the 1970s, carrying visitors and commuters seeking high-paying jobs without the city's high cost of living. In recent years, about 450 passengers rode on weekdays, though that number has declined. Bieber's license to operate at the Port Authority was terminated on July 28, the first time that has happened in recent years, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the terminal. He said Bieber still owes about $125,000. Matthew Daus, a lawyer who represents Bieber, said the company was facing ""financial difficulties in the year leading up to the termination by the Port, and was seeking refinancing in order to keep current with the Port payments, and the refinancing was delayed."" Mr. Daus also said Bieber had to apply for a curbside spot because it could not return to the terminal and that other companies at the terminal also have outside spaces. A Port Authority official opposed the location of Bieber's stop, arguing in an October letter to the city that adding a curbside spot to the heavily congested area outside the terminal ""only complicates an already challenging environment."" It also puts bus companies paying to use the terminal at a competitive disadvantage, according to the letter. City transportation officials said they have limited authority to reject bus stops and were responsive to concerns about Bieber by issuing a permit for only three months — instead of the usual three years — so they could monitor its operations. The stop is already used by a public bus. State law caps how much can be charged in administrative fees for a bus stop: Bieber has paid $1,140. (It would be $4,560 for a full year.) Steve Haddad, the president and chief executive officer of Bieber, said in a statement that ""our company looks forward to being a good neighbor to the community and to continue serving our customers, who have no other way to get to and from New York City to earn a living."" The company, he added, has stationed a dispatcher at the stop to ensure safe and efficient operations. After leaving the terminal, Bieber buses operated on city streets without an approved bus stop, racking up violations and fines, according to The Morning Call, which has reported on the company's financial and legal troubles. Mr. Daus said many violations have been dismissed and others were being appealed or contested. Bieber buses then dropped off passengers in Weehawken, N.J., where they took a ferry across the Hudson River to Manhattan and then used other buses to continue through Midtown. ""I said I was missing one mode of transport — an airplane,"" said Esther Peña, 22, a hospital clinical research coordinator whose two-and-a-half hour one-way commute from Allentown, Pa., grew even longer, to three hours. Many passengers said Bieber should have paid its bills and that its problem became theirs because there were few other transit options. Yolanda Campbell, 32, a nurse, shivered as she waited recently on the curb for a Bieber bus. She had been driving because she did not want to follow Bieber as it moved around and other bus companies had limited routes and hours. But she would get so tired that she had to pull over to nap. ""I was falling asleep every day,"" she said about her commute from the Allentown area. ""I don't care if they're on the street as long as I don't have to drive."""
News,2018-12-03,"About an hour after downloading TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, I experienced a bizarre sensation, one I haven’t felt in a long time while on the internet. The knot in my chest loosened, my head felt injected with helium, and the corners of my mouth crept upward into a smile.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/technology/tiktok-a-chinese-video-app-brings-fun-back-to-social-media.html,1423," About an hour after downloading TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, I experienced a bizarre sensation, one I haven't felt in a long time while on the internet. The knot in my chest loosened, my head felt injected with helium, and the corners of my mouth crept upward into a smile. Was this … happiness? TikTok — a quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment ""Carpool Karaoke"" — is a refreshing outlier in the social media universe.  A so-called challenge video on TikTok, from the user @spellmantwinz, which encouraged users to make videos of themselves chomping down on food to the beat of a song. There are no ads. There's no news, unless you count learning about viral dance crazes. There are few preening Instagram models hawking weight-loss tea, and a distinct lack of crazy uncles posting Infowars clips. Instead, TikTok — a Chinese-made app that was known as Musical.ly until ByteDance, the Chinese internet conglomerate, acquired the company in 2017 and merged it with a video app it owned — has a simple premise. Users create short videos set to music, often lip-syncing along, dancing or acting out short skits. The app contains templates and visual effects to spice up the videos. There is also a live-streaming feature that allows users to send virtual ""gifts"" to their favorite creators, which can be bought with real money. The rest works like any other social app — followers, hashtags, likes and comments. It doesn't sound like much. But, somehow, it adds up to what might well be the only truly pleasant social network in existence. I feel comfortable making that call because I go on social networks for a living, and I have spent thousands of hours wading through an unholy slurry of Twitter spammers, Instagram scammers, teenage YouTube fascists and baby boomers whose brains have been turned to pudding by too many Facebook memes. TikTok has none of that. Instead, it's that rarest of internet creatures: a place where people can let down their guards, act silly with their friends and sample the fruits of human creativity without being barraged by abusive trolls or algorithmically amplified misinformation. It's a throwback to a time before the commercialization of internet influence, when web culture consisted mainly of harmless weirdos trying to make each other laugh. ""It's a bit of an escape,"" said Billy Mann, a TikTok creator who uses the platform to make comedy videos for his more than 650,000 followers.  ""It's a safe haven for people that are seeing the world on fire and being like, 'I need silliness,'"" he said. TikTok's earnest goofiness has turned off some skeptics. But it's hard to argue with the numbers. The app recently passed six million users in the United States, according to a report from the market research firm Sensor Tower. As of Friday, it ranked No. 4 among free apps in Apple's app store, ahead of Snapchat, Netflix and Facebook Messenger. Globally, the app, whose Chinese version is called Douyin, had 500 million monthly active users as of July, making it bigger than Twitter and about half the size of Instagram. Currently, TikTok makes money through virtual gift sales and brand collaborations, such as a Guess-sponsored ""fashion takeover."" There are no ads inside the app, although the company's privacy policy leaves room for them in the future. TikTok, which is privately held, does not disclose financial information, but Sensor Tower estimates that it took in roughly $3.5 million in October. TikTok's success has spawned legions of influencers, users with millions of followers and household-name status among teenagers. And it has propelled ByteDance, which also owns a suite of other social media and news apps, to a reported valuation of $75 billion, making it one of the most valuable start-ups in the world. TikTok's global head of marketing, Stefan Heinrich, said in a statement that the company's mission was to ""capture and present the world's creativity, knowledge and moments that matter, directly from the mobile phone."" In perhaps the clearest sign that TikTok is on to something, Facebook is trying to kill it. Last month, the company quietly released Lasso, a clunky clone that borrowed many of TikTok's core features and even tried to siphon off some of its power users. Lasso got off to a slow start, and is now the 687th most downloaded photo and video app in the United States, according to the mobile data company AppAnnie. The executive leading the Lasso team, Brady Voss, left the company shortly after the app was released. (Facebook declined to comment, and Mr. Voss did not respond to a request for comment.) Before I go any further, let's get one thing out of the way: If you're reading this, you are almost certainly too old to feel at home on TikTok. The company declined to provide information about its users, but judging from what's on the platform, the median TikTok user seems to hover in the midteens. TikTok is full of acne-studded faces, barely concealed tween angst and impenetrable youth-culture references. As far as I can tell, there is no way for adults to use it without feeling as if they are chaperoning a high school dance. Officially, TikTok users must be 13 or older to join. But the age-verification process is easy to circumvent, and while browsing the platform, I stumbled upon several videos starring people who appeared to be much younger. In its previous incarnation as Musical.ly, TikTok drew fire from some privacy advocates, who accused it of pushing the limits of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, a law that prohibits the collection of certain types of information from users younger than 13. ""It's clearly a really popular, cool site, but you also have the issue of kids being significantly too young for it,"" said James P. Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews tech products for families. ""It's not that the content on TikTok isn't O.K. for your 15-year-old. It's what happens to your 6- or 7-year-old."" While using TikTok, I never saw examples of bullying or harassment. (Both of which are prohibited by TikTok's community guidelines, as is sexually explicit content.) There are, however, a decent number of videos featuring teenage girls dancing suggestively — which, if you are a 31-year-old newspaper columnist and not a 16-year-old boy, is fairly unsettling. A TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement that promoting safety and positivity on the platform is ""our top priority."" She added, ""we periodically add to and adjust our protective measures, policies and moderation efforts to support the well-being of our users."" Last year, after two other apps owned by ByteDance were criticized by Chinese officials for promoting objectionable content, the company's chief executive, Zhang Yiming, said that it would increase the ranks of its content moderation team to 10,000 moderators, from 6,000. The TikTok spokeswoman declined to say how many of those moderators work for TikTok, or whether content standards for American users differ from those for users in China, where famously strict censorship laws apply. Free-speech advocates might bristle at TikTok's Chinese ownership, and privacy hawks have raised questions about how the company handles users' personal data. But perhaps because it is more heavily moderated than other networks, TikTok mostly feels safe and wholesome. Julia Alexander, a fellow TikTok convert at The Verge, called it ""a rare social app that isn't infested with hateful rhetoric."" One popular genre of TikTok video is the ""challenge,"" a kind of video skit that is acted out en masse. One challenge, #eatonthebeat, encouraged users to make videos of themselves chomping down on food to the beat of a song. Another challenge, #chooseyourcharacter, encouraged users to mimic a video game's character selection screen. Then there are the running jokes attached to specific songs — like ""Good Girls Bad Guys,"" a song by the band Falling in Reverse, which is used for a genre of video in which a user appears first in nerdy, unattractive clothes, and then cuts abruptly to a made-over version of himself in sunglasses, leather jackets or other bad-boy attire. Despite TikTok's teens-only vibe, some adults have started to trickle on. Jimmy Fallon, the late-night TV host, recently joined the site and started posting his own challenges. The comedian Amy Schumer recently made a TikTok video, and prominent YouTubers like Jake Paul have tested the waters. Is TikTok a Facebook killer? No, probably not. For all the variety in its videos, it is still a fairly limited app, with a more narrow appeal than more populist social platforms. But by purposely limiting its features, by resisting the temptation to monetize its users aggressively and by keeping trolls and bullies off its platform, TikTok has done something truly impressive — it has built a social network that is genuinely fun to use. There might be a lesson there."
News,2018-12-03,"FAIRBANKS, Alaska — The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the most pristine landscapes in the United States. But that may soon change as the Trump administration seeks to exploit an untapped trove of oil beneath its coastal plain. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/us/alaska-oil-drilling-takeaways.html,1023," FAIRBANKS, Alaska — The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the most pristine landscapes in the United States. But that may soon change as the Trump administration seeks to exploit an untapped trove of oil beneath its coastal plain.  Since Congress approved a measure last December to open the coastal plain to oil exploration, the Department of the Interior has been charging ahead with a plan to sell drilling leases as early as next year. Trucks weighing 90,000 pounds could begin rolling across the tundra even before then to conduct seismic tests that help pinpoint oil reserves. The hurried approach has alarmed some government specialists and environmentalists, who say that risks to wildlife and damage to the tundra are not being taken seriously enough. And it comes as the Trump administration moves more broadly to exploit fossil fuels in Alaska and beyond, erasing restrictive policies that were designed to protect the environment and address global warming.  The New York Times examined how, in the space of about a year, the refuge's coastal plain — known as the 1002 Area — went from off-limits to open for business. Here are six takeaways. In 1960, Congress set aside millions of acres of land in northeast Alaska for wildlife protection, but the discovery of oil reserves around Prudhoe Bay in 1968 suggested such riches may also exist elsewhere, including under the coastal plain. Ever since, Alaskan lawmakers have been at the forefront of a push to allow oil exploration in the plain. In 1980, Congress passed conservation legislation that left an opening for eventual oil and gas development there, but over the years opponents blocked repeated attempts by Alaskans — and Republicans — to proceed.  While Alaskans generally favor drilling in the state, a poll last year by researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities showed that 70 percent of registered voters nationwide opposed it in the reserve. There is also the question of whether additional domestic oil production is even necessary in the United States, especially in the Arctic — where it is costly to produce — as the world needs to eventually wean itself off fossil fuels. The 2016 election brought about a rare opportunity. With Republicans controlling Congress and the presidency, the opening of the refuge to oil exploration became an urgent priority for Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, and others in her party. Democrats in the Senate still had the ability to filibuster any legislation that would directly authorize drilling, so Ms. Murkowski found an end run. She engineered a provision in last December's tax overhaul bill that characterized oil exploration on the coastal plain as a way to grow federal revenues. The bill passed the Senate on a straight party-line vote. When President Trump signed it into law with much fanfare, he was also authorizing drilling in the refuge. In preparing to see through the new authorization, the Department of the Interior, which has jurisdiction over federal lands, filled key jobs with appointees who were committed to oil exploration and had deep connections to Alaska.  A former Washington lobbyist, David Bernhardt, was appointed deputy Interior secretary. In 2014, he had represented the state of Alaska when it sued the federal government over its refusal to review oil exploration plans for the refuge. Another top appointee, Joe Balash, had served as Alaska's commissioner of natural resources at the time of the lawsuit. Officials with the Interior Department pledge to conduct an impartial process, but environmental groups fear the new appointees are pursuing a predetermined outcome. Before it can begin selling leases to drill for oil, the Interior Department is required by law to conduct environmental studies to help identify and address potentially negative consequences. The studies are typically time-consuming and involve extensive public engagement. But the Trump administration has moved to fast-track them. The biggest and most important of the studies is on pace to be completed in half the usual time, and only one public hearing has been held outside Alaska.  Opponents fear that cutting corners could jeopardize the environment or put wildlife, such as polar bears, in harm's way. They point to problems associated with seismic testing in the mid-1980s. But the Interior Department says that its procedures have improved since then, and that the environmental reviews can be conducted more speedily this time because of previously collected scientific material. Big-name oil companies have been largely absent from the public discussions about tapping oil reserves on the coastal plain, but a lesser-known company called Arctic Slope Regional Corporation has taken a leading role. The corporation, one of 13 formed in the 1970s to foster economic development among Alaska's indigenous population, stands to enjoy a windfall from oil development, in part because it separately owns rights to drill on 92,000 acres within the coastal plain. The corporation, which has been a key financial backer of Ms. Murkowski, ramped up its lobbying efforts in Washington under the Trump administration. The role of A.S.R.C., a private company that counts 13,000 Alaska Natives as it shareholders, has become a flash point in the debate between Native communities over the fate of the coastal plain.  Natives who live in the coastal area, many of whom are A.S.R.C. shareholders, generally support oil development. Other Natives who live south of the refuge oppose drilling. They fear it would disturb the migration of porcupine caribou, animals they have hunted for centuries for food. Drilling proponents of drilling have never been this close to achieving their goals, but even the most optimistic among them say actual drilling is a decade or more away. The potential headwinds are formidable.  For one, environmental groups are closely watching every step of the process, and lawsuits are likely. And Democrats will soon control the House of Representatives, and are pledging to make aggressive oversight of the leasing process a priority. For its part, the Interior Department says it is using extreme care, knowing full well the challenges ahead."
News,2018-12-03,"FAIRBANKS, Alaska — It is the last great stretch of nothingness in the United States, a vast landscape of mosses, sedges and shrubs that is home to migrating caribou and the winter dens of polar bears.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/us/oil-drilling-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge.html,4109," FAIRBANKS, Alaska — It is the last great stretch of nothingness in the United States, a vast landscape of mosses, sedges and shrubs that is home to migrating caribou and the winter dens of polar bears. Aside from a Native village at its northern tip, civilization has not dented its 19 million acres, an area the size of South Carolina. There are no roads and no visitors beyond the occasional hunter and backpacker. But the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — a federally protected place of austere beauty that during a recent flyover was painted white by heavy snowfall — is on the cusp of major change. The biggest untapped onshore trove of oil in North America is believed to lie beneath the refuge's coastal plain along the Beaufort Sea. For more than a generation, opposition to drilling has left the refuge largely unscathed, but now the Trump administration, working with Republicans in Congress and an influential and wealthy Alaska Native corporation, is clearing the way for oil exploration along the coast. Decades of protections are unwinding with extraordinary speed as Republicans move to lock in drilling opportunities before the 2020 presidential election, according to interviews with over three dozen people and a review of internal government deliberations and federal documents. To that end, the Trump administration is on pace to finish an environmental impact assessment in half the usual time. An even shorter evaluation of the consequences of seismic testing is nearing completion. Within months, trucks weighing up to 90,000 pounds could be conducting the tests across the tundra as they try to pinpoint oil reserves. While actual oil production would be a decade or more away, the turnaround represents a prized breakthrough in the Trump administration's campaign to exploit fossil fuels and erase restrictive policies protecting the environment and addressing global warming. [Here are six key takeaways from The Times's examination of the race for Alaskan oil.]  The Interior Department, which has jurisdiction over the Arctic refuge, has been central to the administration's regulatory rollback in Alaska and beyond, accommodating the wishes of big businesses to strip down rules on how federal lands can be used. The oil and gas industry has been among the biggest beneficiaries as the administration has relaxed or abandoned regulations meant to safeguard air quality, groundwater supplies and wildlife.

It is also pushing for more exploration and production offshore and in the National Petroleum Reserve, west of the refuge. All of this is coming despite a glut in domestic oil production that raises the question of whether more oil from the Arctic — which is costly to produce — is necessary or makes economic sense, especially given the need to eventually wean the world off fossil fuels. The fate of the refuge's coastal plain is in the hands of Ryan Zinke, the Interior secretary, who has appointed top deputies with deep professional and political ties to Alaska to oversee its development. In 2014, two of the appointees were involved in an unsuccessful court challenge to Obama-era policies that had helped keep the area off limits. Congressional approval to open the area to oil exploration was inserted in tax overhaul legislation last December under the guise of generating revenue for the federal government, and by next year, the Interior Department expects to begin selling the first drilling leases. The hurried timeline has created friction, with some specialists in the federal government concerned that environmental risks are being downplayed or ignored. And many outside scientists and environmentalists share the concerns, warning that plans for seismic testing and eventual drilling could harass, injure or kill polar bears and other wildlife. ""It seems as though the administration is in a headlong rush to put the drill bit into the coastal plain,"" said David J. Hayes, a deputy Interior secretary in the Obama and Clinton administrations. ""Given the virgin territory of the refuge, with the unique wildlife dependency issues, I don't know how you do this in an artificially fast and truncated fashion."" Mr. Zinke's Alaska-friendly appointees, who have long pushed for oil exploration in the coastal plain, say the fears are overstated. They point out that years ago, Congress left open the eventual possibility of allowing development there. Exploration is in the best interest of Alaskans, they say. ""I feel like there is a lot of expectations, hopes and dreams from people who I know and love that are riding on this,"" said Joe Balash, one of the appointees, who has worked in Alaskan political circles for two decades and now oversees the Bureau of Land Management. An Alaska Native company, Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, has been a major force behind the push and stands to enjoy a windfall if drilling proceeds. The corporation, which has been awarded more than $7.5 billion in federal contracts in the past 10 years, expanded its lobbying under the Trump administration, records show, and Mr. Zinke appointed one of its executives to a top post. Known as A.S.R.C., it is among 13 regional businesses created in the 1970s to foster economic development among Alaska's indigenous population. It has myriad financial interests in the state's oil-rich North Slope region, which includes the refuge's coastal plain and Prudhoe Bay, home to one of the largest oil fields in North America. And it has been a key financial backer of Senator Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican, who has been the drilling plan's biggest champion in Congress. Many Natives on the North Slope — including Inupiat who live in Kaktovik, the village inside the refuge — support oil development. But another group that lives south of the refuge, the Gwich'in, fears oil development would disturb the migration of porcupine caribou, animals it has hunted for centuries and still relies on for much of its food. A nationwide poll last year by researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities showed that 70 percent of registered voters in the United States opposed drilling in the reserve. Ms. Murkowski declined to comment, as did Alaska's other elected representatives in Washington. Mr. Zinke also declined to comment. But he told a Senate committee in March that he was ""very bullish on the Arctic."" The struggle over oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has its roots 50 years ago in the discovery of petroleum reserves around Prudhoe Bay, west of the refuge. Congress in 1960 had set aside millions of acres in northeast Alaska for wildlife, lands that were largely off the beaten path, geographically and politically, and included the refuge's coastal plain. But with the Prudhoe Bay discovery in 1968, the calculus changed. Many thought the plain might hold riches too. In 1980, when Congress voted to conserve much of the federal land in Alaska, drilling advocates pushed for oil and gas development on the coastal plain. Then, as now, the move was supported by many Alaskans, who generally favor oil development, in part because some of the revenue is returned to them in the form of an annual dividend. Drilling has largely had bipartisan support among Alaskan lawmakers as well. The advocates were unsuccessful but had an opening: The 1980 bill allowed Congress to authorize oil and gas development at a later date. The 1.5-million-acre coastal plain, identified in Section 1002 of the legislation, has been known since as the 1002 Area. In 1995, with Republicans controlling both houses of Congress for the first time in decades, legislation was approved to allow development. But Democrats opposed the measure and President Bill Clinton vetoed it. When Republicans held on to Congress in the 2016 elections and President Trump won the White House, drilling proponents saw another opening. Ms. Murkowski told reporters within hours of Mr. Trump's victory that she would renew the push for legislation. That set in motion a furious effort to win congressional approval and position the Interior Department to carry a plan forward. A flight from Alaska's central Arctic coast to Fairbanks is a straight shot. But when Mr. Zinke and Ms. Murkowski flew the route in May last year, just a few months into the Interior secretary's tenure, the pilot made a wide detour to the east. Below them was the vast 1002 Area, extending between the Brooks Range and the Beaufort Sea, still off limits to oil and gas exploration but now within their political sights. A few days later in Anchorage, Ms. Murkowski introduced Mr. Zinke at an oil and gas conference. ""The only path for energy dominance is a path through the great state of Alaska,"" Mr. Zinke told the group. Seven months later, Congress voted to open the coastal plain to exploration. Getting approval in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives was not an issue. But in the Senate, Ms. Murkowski needed a bill that could survive a likely filibuster. The solution was to characterize oil exploration as a revenue raiser — with a target of $1 billion for the Treasury over 10 years — and insert it into Mr. Trump's tax overhaul legislation. The oil provision authorized two lease sales of drilling rights for at least 400,000 acres each, directing the ""Secretary of Interior, acting through the Bureau of Land Management,"" to oversee the development. The innocuous-sounding bureaucratic language was intended to fast-track the effort by marginalizing skeptics in another Interior agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service. At a hearing, current and former Alaska politicians spoke in favor of opening the refuge, as did representatives of two Native corporations, including A.S.R.C. Several A.S.R.C. executives stayed in Washington to press for the measure, part of a push that saw the corporation's lobbying expenditures nearly double to $590,000 in 2017 from $320,000 the previous year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group. The A.S.R.C. officials were joined by Natives from Kaktovik in the Senate gallery on Dec. 20, when the bill was approved on a straight party-line vote, and later that day on the South Lawn of the White House and in the Oval Office. During a cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump praised the decision to open land that ""for 40 years this country was unable to touch."" And in a message posted to Twitter, Mr. Zinke wrote, ""It was a key part of @realDonaldTrump budget."" Mr. Zinke had been preparing for this moment since he took office. As his confirmation hearing, he had promised a fresh approach to Alaska, and he went about delivering on that pledge by filling important jobs at the Interior Department with Alaska and Arctic exploration in mind. A Washington lobbyist, David Bernhardt, was appointed deputy secretary. Mr. Bernhardt had represented Alaska in litigation against the federal government, including an unsuccessful lawsuit in 2014 that sought a review of the state's plan for exploring oil and gas resources within the coastal plain of the refuge. Earlier, he served at the Interior Department under President George W. Bush. A campaign manager to Ms. Murkowski, Steve Wackowski, was named senior adviser for Alaskan affairs. He had also had a job as operations manager for a joint venture focused on remote sensing in North Slope oil fields, his résumé said. An owner of that venture is Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, a Native company that has surface rights in the refuge and a stake, along with A.S.R.C., in another partnership seeking to conduct seismic testing there. A third official with Alaska ties, Mr. Balash, now oversees the Bureau of Land Management, giving him direct oversight of Arctic exploration. His first day on the job was the day after the tax legislation passed. Mr. Balash grew up in Alaska and served as chief of staff to Senator Dan Sullivan, the Alaska Republican. In 2014, when the state sued the federal government, he was commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. ""Given my background and work history,"" Mr. Balash said, ""I felt privileged to be able to work on this project. It has been something that, obviously, has been a subject of some debate."" Drilling proponents cheered the appointments. ""We had no friends under Obama,"" said Rebecca Logan, chief executive of the Alaska Support Industry Alliance, a trade group representing over 500 companies that provide oil field services. ""Now, we've got the Interior Department where there are great Alaskan friends."" Despite the close ties, industry officials insist they are not getting a free pass. ""I'm not expecting a rubber stamp,"" said Kara Moriarty, the chief executive of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, who has a framed photo with Mr. Zinke in her Anchorage office. ""I'm expecting a very diligent and thorough process."" But those who oppose drilling in the refuge, including many Democrats in Washington, suspect the Department of Interior is not being so diligent. Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who will become chairman of the Natural Resources Committee next month, said he would probably call a hearing about the Arctic development with the goal of slowing it down. ""We can make sure that corners are not being cut,"" said Mr. Grijalva, who last week called for Mr. Zinke to resign because of ethics allegations against him, prompting a personal attack from the secretary. Scores of environmental organizations are also watching closely, ready to sue whenever an opportunity arises. ""There are groups out there who will fight this tooth and nail, no matter what,"" Mr. Balash said. ""It is fair to say I've been lawyered up on this project from Day 1."" One time-consuming hurdle for big drilling projects is getting the environmental clearances. During the Obama administration, the environmental review of drilling prospects in another part of Alaska ran well over 1,000 pages and took two and a half years to complete. Not this time. A draft environmental impact statement on the coastal plain leasing plan is expected to be released soon, with the finished version to follow next spring, just a year after being ordered. And a separate assessment of seismic testing is also expected any day, that one just months in the making. The hurry-up follows a directive from Mr. Bernhardt, the deputy secretary, limiting all environmental impact statements to one year and 150 pages, or 300 pages for ""unusually complex"" projects. Mr. Bernhardt cited the need to reduce paperwork. Mr. Balash, of the Bureau of Land Management, said the shorter time frame was also possible in part because the bureau was relying on past scientific studies. ""It's not as though we're starting from scratch,"" he said. Older studies may be less useful, however, because of changes in the Arctic related to warming. Completing the environmental impact statement by next spring should allow the department to sell leases in 2019, Mr. Balash said, even faster than in the language of the 2017 tax bill. In justifying the pace, Mr. Balash said many people had ""been waiting for this for a very long time."" Opponents say that having leases in the hands of oil companies before the 2020 elections would make halting the drilling program more difficult should a Democrat win the White House. They also complain that the public has been sidelined in the interest of speed. Although the fate of the Arctic refuge is a federal issue of national interest, just one hearing has been held outside Alaska. ""There's going to be damage, going to be long-lasting effects from what they do,"" said Geoffrey L. Haskett, president of the National Wildlife Refuge Association and a former Alaska regional director with the Fish and Wildlife Service, the managing agency of the refuge. ""I just can't imagine that what we're going to see is going to be adequate,"" he added, referring to the environmental evaluations. The rushed schedule has led to rifts between the Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife Service, which was forced into a secondary role by the language of the tax bill. Greta Burkart, an aquatic ecologist who resigned in June after more than seven years with the service in Alaska, said the accelerated process had further marginalized the agency. Dr. Burkart said that was one of the reasons she resigned. ""I felt there was little that Fish and Wildlife could do at that point,"" she said. She said that scientists were given less time than usual to provide expert comment on draft sections of the environmental reviews — just 48 hours in some cases — and that their comments were sometimes not acknowledged. Other current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, had similar complaints. The decision to conduct an environmental assessment of the seismic testing proposal, a less rigorous review than a full environmental impact statement, was especially troubling for many drilling opponents. They point to damage done to the tundra by seismic testing in the mid-1980s; some vehicle tracks from that work remain visible more than 30 years later. And they worry about the disruption of polar bears. The population of polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea has been declining for years as climate change has reduced the extent of sea ice in the Arctic. The population is now estimated at 800 to 900 animals. Pregnant bears dig winter dens in the snow on the coastal plain, and if those dens are not detected during the seismic work, the mothers and their newborn cubs could be disturbed or endangered by the heavy trucks. [Read more in this interview with a polar bear expert.] Steven C. Amstrup, chief scientist with Polar Bears International, a conservation group, said the coastal plain in the refuge "" ""is the most important maternal denning area"" for the southern Beaufort Sea population. Dr. Amstrup, a former United States Geological Survey zoologist who has studied the bears for three decades, said his research had shown that the heat-sensing technology used to detect dens would probably miss about half the dens, which would probably be disturbed during the seismic work. Jeff Hastings, chairman of SAExploration, part of the seismic-testing joint venture, said improved technology would prevent damage to the tundra this time around. He also said his company was working with the Interior Department on ways to protect the bears by holding off on testing in some areas until after the animals have left their dens, for example. When Mr. Zinke went in search of influential Alaskans to fill top posts in his Interior Department, he turned to people who had worked for elected officials in the state and for past Republican administrations in Washington. He also looked to A.S.R.C., a multibillion-dollar business that stands to gain the most financially if drilling commences in the 1002 Area. Tara Sweeney, its former executive vice president for external affairs, is now assistant secretary for Indian affairs. Her federal financial disclosure form, filed in February, showed that at A.S.R.C. she had been paid more than $1 million over the prior 13 months, including incentives from previous years. The cultural accents on the grounds of A.S.R.C.'s corporate offices in Anchorage honor the traditions of its 13,000 Native shareholders, and feature Inupiaq sculptures and a diorama of a whaling festival. But inside the 10-story building, A.S.R.C. reveals itself as a powerful conglomerate poised to take full advantage of any oil and gas exploration to come. Its subsidiaries include an energy services outfit, a fuel-refining and marketing operation and a construction company, all at the ready to supply services to oil companies that acquire drilling rights. A.S.R.C. also has a stake in the seismic-testing partnership lined up to explore the 1002 Area, as well as rights to drill on 92,000 acres within 1002. More than 30 years ago, BP and Chevron drilled a single test hole in the 1002 Area on land leased from A.S.R.C. and Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation. The results of that test, which have been kept secret, may hold clues about the reserves that could help explain A.S.R.C.'s enthusiasm for drilling. Bill Horn, a Reagan administration official who helped negotiate the deal that gave A.S.R.C. drilling rights in the 1002 Area, recalled how people involved in the drilling left that testing in 1986 ""hot to trot"" about the potential reserves. With nearly $2.7 billion in annual revenue, A.S.R.C. is the largest of the Alaska Native corporations and ranks 169th on Forbes's nationwide list of private companies by revenue. Still, A.S.R.C. has little name recognition outside Alaska, allowing it to attract relatively little attention while lobbying. ""We like being under the radar,"" said Teresa Imm, the company's senior vice president for resource development, who was among the executives who traveled to Washington last year to press for the tax legislation. Over the past decade, the company has spent more than $3 million on lobbying, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Some of the A.S.R.C. leaders, including Ms. Imm, are not Alaska Natives, but the company has had the ability to speak and act on behalf of Native communities. Ms. Imm said A.S.R.C. was simply trying to make good on promises to develop the land for its shareholders. But there are deep disagreements over A.S.R.C.'s role in the drilling campaign, and whether its corporate interests align with those of Native families who have lived off the land for generations. Some, like Sam Alexander, a Gwich'in formerly from Fort Yukon, say A.S.R.C. has gone too far. ""Native corporations are not tribes,"" said Mr. Alexander, who teaches at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ""The only thing Native about them is their name. They are just corporations."" A.S.R.C. officials say that the company has never represented itself as a tribe, but that its shareholders are members of various Alaskan tribes. For decades, the Gwich'in have led the Native opposition to drilling, arguing that opening the 1002 Area could affect the porcupine caribou, a major source of food and a spiritual touchstone. ""We are asking to continue to live the way we always have,"" said Bernadette Demientieff, the executive director of the Gwich'in Steering Committee, which opposes oil development in the refuge and recently joined with the Sierra Club to try to persuade banks to hold back financing for exploration. The steering committee has also worked with environmental groups to persuade politicians to defend the refuge from drilling. Matthew Rexford, the tribal administrator of Kaktovik and the president of Kaktovik Inupiat Group, said the drilling could be done responsibly and should go forward. Unlike the Gwich'in, Mr. Rexford's village stands to benefit financially. ""I have given this a lot of thought, and our community has given this a lot of thought,"" he said. ""We do feel it can be done in an environmentally safe and sound manner."" But some Inupiat have reservations. ""Think about what's going to happen to this land if there is an oil spill and the response that's going to come along with it,"" Adrienne Aakaluk Titus, a community organizer in Fairbanks, said at hearing in Kaktovik. The muscle of the Native corporations has not been lost on Alaskan politicians like Ms. Murkowski, who has supported their interests and been rewarded in return. Under federal law, the corporations are considered ""disadvantaged,"" meaning they receive preference in contracting. A.S.R.C. and the other 12 regional corporations received $3.3 billion in contracts in the 2017 fiscal year, federal data show. Beginning in 2009, there was a move in Congress to curtail the preferential treatment. An investigation by a Senate subcommittee found that the corporations were among the largest federal contractors, often landing high-value contracts without having to bid. Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who led the subcommittee, complained that the corporations relied ""heavily on non-Native managers"" and employed ""relatively few of their shareholders"" as she pushed for changes to contracting practices, some of which went into effect in 2011. Ms. Murkowski helped limit the changes, defending the work of the Native corporations and arguing, along with other Alaskan officials, that her Senate colleagues should not use income alone to measure disadvantage. ""We're talking about a population many times without a road system or water supply system,"" she said in 2011. A year earlier, when Ms. Murkowski lost the Republican Senate primary, she took the unusual step of seeking re-election as a write-in candidate. It was a complicated feat that leaned heavily on her support among the Native corporations. The corporations set up a political action committee that spent $1.6 million to back her successful campaign. A.S.R.C. was one of the largest supporters, contributing $200,000. A year ago, after the tax bill passed, the A.S.R.C.'s newsletter featured a photograph on its cover from an Oval Office celebration with Mr. Trump. Ms. Murkowski, beaming, appeared surrounded by Alaska Natives and A.S.R.C. officials."

And who is to blame? Kim Brooks raised these questions in her Opinion essay ""America Is Blaming Pregnant Women for Their Own Deaths."" More than 900 readers responded with comments on the article, including parents who shared their own harrowing birth stories and who often said they felt their lives were devalued, in favor of their child's, by their doctors during the delivery process.  Medical professionals responded with accounts of systemic problems within the health care industry, such as the lack of emergency protocols in hospitals that would protect the life of the mother. Kayla Tab, a nurse in San Francisco, commented on the difficulties of weighing which life to prioritize in the case of an emergency: ""In health care, we may make it seem like it's all about the baby, but that's often times because the fear of a stillbirth weighs so heavily on us. We feel caught in the middle."" For one commenter and his wife, the decision was clear cut. ""We went into it, no questions asked, mother's life,"" he wrote. ""As tragic as a child's loss is, without the mother, the child doesn't happen."" Read more comments below from our readers. They have been edited for clarity and length. This is not just a problem of hospitals, doctors and public policy, but also of social demands. Anything a woman desires for herself — autonomy, respect, physical wholeness — is considered selfish. Get a group of new mothers together and eventually they will start to tell their birth stories — the joys, horrors, indignities, pain and subtle, or not so subtle, misogyny. And in the midst of this ""safe space"" it never takes long before one woman will say, ""You have a healthy baby, that's all that matters."" This can only happen in a society in which women are constantly devalued. It's not a zero sum game: healthy baby or healthy mother; we can have both. — Corey Anderson, Atlanta There are many sides to making sure women are heard. Choice over our bodies also includes the right to a ""medicalized"" birth, if that is our preference. Medical interventions save lives, and many women, myself included, prefer that their doctors err on the side of the baby's life. Go on any pregnancy message board and you will find that there are tons of expectant mothers who put the ""birth experience"" before the health of their baby and who consider medical actions taken to save their child's life as some kind of affront to that experience. — A F, Connecticut We welcomed our first child this spring. The process left much to be desired. I feel if I hadn't been there to speak up for my wife, it could have gone awfully different. I don't have a whole lot of faith in the new generation of doctors. In our encounters, they seemed entitled and even forceful, taking steps without checking with the mother and pressing unneeded procedures. I had to assert myself into the situation more than once to have my wife's concerns heard. — WI Transplant, Madison, Wis.  I am an obstetrician and this is an exceedingly important topic, one that many people are passionately devoting their lives to correcting. I believe that the system we work in is flawed from top to bottom, in ways that create serious gaps for low-income and low-resource patients. But I fear the author is doing a disservice to this topic by equating these particular terrifying outcomes with poor care by doctors. These anecdotes don't highlight this crisis particularly well and only fan the flames of the anti-medicine, anti-doctor rhetoric that gets in the way of caring for people. There are bad doctors just like there are bad plumbers, but it's the system that is failing people, not the individuals. — MMS, Cambridge, Mass.  As a mother who recently gave birth, I am of two minds about this issue. Having seen many women of my generation flippantly reject medical care to give birth in their living rooms with midwives with little training, and others who feel guilt for years for having succumbed to C-sections, having ""failed"" at the ideal, natural birth, I wish that we could get over the medical-establishment-as-villain narrative. I've had seven pregnancies and have one living child. I have my living child because of, not in spite of, medical science. — Amv, New York The idea that women know what's best in some natural way is wrongheaded. My wife would have died if she'd made the now routine choice to determine her own care path and have the baby at home. This feels akin to the vaccine craze, something that's been safe for so long but now people don't feel the danger associated with deviating from the well-worn path. — John McDavid, Nevada Women don't need more doulas, midwives or listening to, although all of those things can be beneficial. The two greatest threats to women's health in and after childbirth are a doctor's low index of suspicion of symptoms that could indicate underlying injuries and a reluctance — or inability — to deploy high-tech interventions in a timely fashion. That's why California has had success in reducing maternal mortality. They've gone back to basics, recognizing that childbirth has always been, in every time, place and culture, one of the leading causes of death of women and that only technology used liberally can reduce that death rate. — Amy Tuteur, M.D., Boston Women are routinely not listened to or believed, especially black women, whose maternal mortality rates are 3.5 times higher than white women, as the author points out. Postpartum anxiety and depression, traumatic birth injuries, an abysmal lack of paid parental leave, judgment from family members, all of this is isolating, as well as physically and mentally debilitating. — New Mama, Massachusetts I am a physician and I have no doubt that the problems with obstetric care described are real and in need of correction. However, conditions for an optimal outcome for mother and baby start much earlier in pregnancy, if not before. Many women, particularly those who are poor or in a minority, have other adverse factors like poor nutrition, teen pregnancy and substance abuse, to name a few. Pointing this out is not ""blaming the victim,"" but rather showing the need for a vigorous public health response and universal access to family planning and prenatal care. — Hoarbear, Pittsburgh This story says nothing about one of the most obvious reasons why maternal mortality continues to rise in the U.S.A. but not in other developed countries: health insurance. The availability, or not, of high-quality prenatal, obstetric and postpartum care correlates directly with the mother's financial resources. Until all women can access high-quality medical care, nothing will change. — Nikki, Islandia It infuriates me that women in this country are denied birth control and autonomy over their own bodies by law when it comes to taking steps to prevent or terminate a pregnancy that took joint efforts with a man to create; seen as mere incubators and a secondary concern to a fetus once they are pregnant; and dismissed as mere statistics when they die in childbirth after a full-term pregnancy.  Spare me the ""it's a scary time for young men in America"" nonsense that's being parroted by the obtuse and ignorant misogynists, like Trump. If it's scary to be a man right now, then it's downright dangerous, even fatal, to be a woman. — EM, Los Angeles Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
News,2018-12-04,"Turning Point: North and South Korean athletes march under a unified flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/opinion/korea-hyeonseo-lee.html,931," Turning Point: North and South Korean athletes march under a unified flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Growing up in North Korea in the 1980s, I was brainwashed into believing that South Koreans were suffering horribly under their government, but that with the unconditional support of the North Korean people, our ""Dear Leader"" Kim Il-sung would liberate our southern neighbors and reunify the Korean Peninsula. I eventually escaped my homeland as a teenager and learned the harsh truth, yet I still hold on to a sliver of hope that I will one day live in a united and free Korea. In 2015, I found myself standing next to a section of the Berlin Wall after giving a TEDx talk about North Korea. I started chatting with a woman from the former East Germany, who told me about the surreal excitement that gripped Berlin on the day the wall fell in November 1989. Germans started rushing toward the wall to see if the seemingly impossible had actually happened. People cried tears of joy as a boundary that had artificially divided the German people for so long was finally destroyed. I desperately want the Korean people to experience a similar moment. After fighting back tears, I signed a still-standing section of the Berlin Wall with a special message. I vowed that within my lifetime I would help to remove the ugly scar of the Demilitarized Zone, the line that divides the Korean Peninsula — and its people — in two. Despite the renewed optimism for reconciliation between the North and South following recent summits with the nations' leaders, the prospect of reunification remains dim. One recent trend has been particularly disheartening: Survey data indicates that a sizable number of South Koreans, particularly younger Southerners, are resistant to reunification. One of the primary reasons is the massive financial burden that reunification would impose on South Korea, which, based on some estimates, could cost between $1 trillion and $3 trillion. Also at issue are the widening cultural and economic gaps caused by over 70 years of division, which have diminished the importance of a shared ethnic heritage, leading some Koreans on both sides of the DMZ to reject the idea of a united Korean national identity. Despite these challenges, the long-term economic and security benefits of reunification greatly outweigh the short-term costs. The South's capital and technology combined with the North's natural resources and immense labor pool would create significant economic opportunities for the peninsula. A united Korea would also have a stronger military. Koreans concerned about the burdens of reunification must consider it from a deeper perspective. We owe an extraordinary debt of gratitude to those ancestors who sacrificed their lives to fight for Korea's independence and freedom. Our culture and language live on because of them. It is our duty to continue marching along the path paved by our ancestors — toward a strong, whole and united Korea. Unfortunately, there is another major obstacle standing in our way: the striking lack of tolerance extending across the entire peninsula. Even after North Korean defectors have denounced the regime and embraced life in the South, many South Koreans still refuse to accept them, subjecting escapees to bullying, ostracism and other forms of mistreatment. Partly as a result, separate schools have been established in the South to help young Northerners adjust to their new lives. But even as adults, Northerners are subject to workplace discrimination and social isolation. A 2018 study found that ""suicidal thoughts and behaviors"" are more common among North Korean defectors than the South Korean population at large. Unfortunately, South Koreans would likely face the same problems in the North if the situation were reversed. In North Korea, where the average citizen has little interaction with foreigners or exposure to other cultures, racism and xenophobia are ingrained and unabashed — a hostility that reaches to the very top. The regime's propagandists brazenly referred to former President Barack Obama as a ""wicked black monkey"" during his second term. South Koreans can also be hostile to outsiders. The arrival earlier this year of a few hundred Yemeni asylum-seekers on the island of Jeju sparked a fierce backlash, based in part on concerns over crime, jobs and cultural differences. Hundreds of thousands of Southerners signed a petition urging their government to reject the refugees. South Koreans expressing such sentiments fail to acknowledge that many Koreans were themselves accepted as refugees and adopted by foreigners in the aftermath of the Korean War. (Sadly, members of the Korean diaspora who return to the peninsula today to live and explore their roots are sometimes rejected for not being Korean enough.) Some South Koreans also forget that foreign soldiers fought and died alongside their countrymen during the war. Given this history, and that South Korea is a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention, the South has an obligation to embrace those fleeing war and other calamities throughout the world. To those Koreans who are uncomfortable with the notion of an inclusive society, I say this: If you want a united Korea to be accepted as a member of the international community, this is a reality you must learn to accept. Having more personal interactions with foreigners is a critical first step. The ancestors who fought for our freedom left us a legacy of sacrifice. We must leave the same legacy for the generations to come, by doing what is necessary to create a united and welcoming Korea — one that all Koreans, as well as all those seeking shelter from foreign conflicts, can call home."

Last week's meeting in Buenos Aires was no different. In fact, it appeared to be an even more inauspicious moment than usual for a high-stakes foreign trip. Ukraine and Russia remain on hair-trigger war footing, while President Trump resorted inexplicably to his classic ""both sides-ism"" rather than clearly condemning Russian aggression. Having whitewashed the Saudi crown prince's apparent direct involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, President Trump abandoned all pretense of principled leadership by pledging to pursue business as usual with the Saudis. Then, just as the president was about to be wheels-up, the guilty plea by his former lawyer Michael Cohen revealed that Mr. Trump was more enmeshed in discussions over a potential Russian business deal during the 2016 presidential campaign than he had previously acknowledged.  Against this backdrop, and grading on a curve (since every grade can't be an F lest it become meaningless), President Trump's trip to the G-20 could have been a lot worse. We can exhale, noting that no major damage was done. This time, Mr. Trump refrained from publicly vilifying core United States institutions like the courts, the F.B.I. and C.I.A. He neither assailed his political adversaries nor committed major gaffes. Without explanation, Mr. Trump downgraded to private pull-asides two previously planned full bilateral meetings with the Turkish and South Korean leaders, but, thankfully, he avoided insulting any treaty ally. He even flattered his usual nemesis, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. The president was not caught lavishing praise on dictatorial adversaries, having wisely (if likely for reasons other than those claimed) canceled a replay of the disastrous one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia in Helsinki. While we will never know what Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin discussed informally at the G-20 dinner, their exchange was comparatively abbreviated and perhaps less risky.  In addition, Mr. Trump avoided a full-on, public embrace of the pariah crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, leaving it to Mr. Putin and the prince to mime how fellow thugs salute each other when America has taken leave of its moral leadership. Mr. Trump spoke respectfully of former President George H.W. Bush, whose death on Friday provided Americans one final public service by affording President Trump a lame, if handy, excuse to cancel the traditional post-summit news conference. As someone who endured the complaints of the White House press corps when President Barack Obama provided far more generous public access, my initial reaction to this evasion was outrage. But soon, my anger was surpassed by gratitude that Mr. Trump managed to skirt the spectacle of another unscripted news conference on foreign soil. Despite the United States looking petty and isolated as the global outlier on climate change, the G-20 leaders did manage to agree on a final summit communiqué. This once-standard outcome used to be taken for granted but is no longer after Mr. Trump blew up this year's G-7 summit and rattled leaders at NATO, and, just two weeks ago, Vice President Pence left the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference without any agreement. No progress appears to have been made on addressing key global security challenges such as renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine, the Saudi-led war in Yemen, or the unabated North Korean nuclear threat. Rather than rally the Western world to impose additional sanctions on Russia or to punish the Saudis for murdering an American resident in cold blood and repeatedly lying about it, President Trump and his team again took a pass on exerting traditional American leadership. These were significant missed opportunities but not new sins of commission. The signing of the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, marked a milestone toward ending the American-induced crisis with its two neighbors. Yet Mr. Trump declared victory prematurely, given that congressional approval is far from certain. Meanwhile, Canada and Mexico still chafe at continued steel and aluminum tariffs. Finally, President Trump chose to tap the brakes rather than drive the United States-China relationship over the cliff. By agreeing with President Xi Jinping of China to pause additional tariffs for 90 days to allow for continued trade negotiations in exchange for vague Chinese commitments to buy more American goods — plus a welcome commitment to restrict the availability of fentanyl — Mr. Trump has postponed escalation of his costly and risky trade war with Beijing. While perhaps only a temporary respite, this marks the most significant result of the G-20 gathering. With Mr. Trump back on American soil, we can safely conclude that, at least this time, we dodged another blow to our national honor, even as we have surrendered our global leadership and become mostly a global bystander. We can only hope that Mr. Trump and his top advisers will now discern that less is more when it comes to this president's travels abroad. Susan E.

News,2018-12-04,"A new contract with Marriott International that will give housekeepers in San Francisco an eventual $4-an-hour increase and better protections against sexual harassment was approved Monday, ending a nine-week strike by 2,500 workers at seven hotels in that city.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/travel/san-francisco-marriott-strike-over.html,727," A new contract with Marriott International that will give housekeepers in San Francisco an eventual $4-an-hour increase and better protections against sexual harassment was approved Monday, ending a nine-week strike by 2,500 workers at seven hotels in that city. The settlement in San Francisco concludes a nationwide walkout against the world's largest hotel chain. At its peak, the protest involved 7,700 workers at 23 hotels. ""It means so much to me,"" said Larrilou Carumba, a single mother of three who had been earning $23.50 an hour after six years as a housekeeper at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis. ""I can go back to work,"" she said, without worrying ""about where I will get money for my kids, and my health benefits."" Workers at the Marriott Marquis, along with the Marriott Union Square, the Palace Hotel, the St. Regis, the W, and the Westin St. Francis, are set to return to their jobs on Wednesday. ""We look forward to welcoming our associates back at work,"" said Connie Kim, a spokeswoman for Marriott. She declined to comment further. Marriott International is the world's largest hotel chain, with management or franchise agreements under 30 brands in 130 countries and territories. It had net profits last year of $1.37 billion. The dispute involved a range of Marriott brands in Boston; Detroit; four California cities —San Jose, Oakland, San Diego and San Francisco; and Honolulu and Lahaina, in Hawaii.  The deals varied according to the cost of living and ""union density"" in each city, according to Rachel Gumpert, a spokeswoman for the Unite Here union. In San Francisco, she said, it provides ""strong wage increases"" for all workers, improved pensions and preservation of lifetime health care benefits.  A worker in San Francisco who retires while the new contract is in place will receive a pension of $50 per month for each year of employment, said Anand Singh, the president of Unite Here Local 2, which represented the workers in San Francisco. Housekeepers, who are generally the lowest paid workers, will receive increases starting at $1.75 an hour and growing to more than $4 an hour over the life of the four-year contract. The current median wage for housekeepers is $23 an hour, Ms. Gumpert said.  All employees who deal with guests one on one, such as housekeepers and workers who deliver room service or bags, will receive a silent GPS-enabled panic button to summon help if they feel unsafe, she said. Under old work rules, if an employee accused a guest of sexual harassment he or she could only be assured of avoiding contact with that person for a day. Now, employees can have no further contact with the guest, Ms. Gumpert said. And, if there is a ""credible report of inappropriate sexual behavior or unwanted sexual advances,"" the hotel will evict the guest, she said. Housekeepers will also receive a reduced workload that increases over the life of the contract, especially if they have a number of rooms that don't receive daily cleaning as part of Marriott's ""Make A Green Choice"" program. The initiative, billed as an environmental alternative, offers loyalty points to guests who forgo daily room cleaning. Housekeepers had complained that it disrupted the schedule for deep cleaning and that they were at risk of injury while trying to get through the heavy work in all their allotted rooms, no matter how many had previously been pulled from the daily cleaning pool, Ms. Gumpert said. While the financial terms varied by city, the sexual harassment agreement is included in all the contracts. There is also a nationwide plan to bring Marriott officials and union representatives together to discuss automation in the hotels, Ms. Gumpert said.  Ms. Carumba, like many housekeepers, had been working a second job to make ends meet, cleaning a laundromat for three hours each day. ""I will be able to take care of my kids now because I don't need to go work another job,"" she said. The strike in San Francisco was particularly confrontational, and more than 100 union employees have been arrested since it began, on Oct. 4. Mr. Singh was arrested twice for civil disobedience. ""I think this campaign and the contract that we achieved certainly sets the standard in San Francisco, and it demonstrates that militant action in today's economy, even with large employers, can deal real successes,"" Mr. Singh said. ""We certainly hope it paves the way for settlements in our industry and in other industries."""
News,2018-12-04,"When Hayley Hanway graduated from the University of Michigan in 2013, she expected to quickly land a job in her desired field of ecosystem management.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/well/family/late-to-launch-the-post-collegiate-struggle.html,1385," When Hayley Hanway graduated from the University of Michigan in 2013, she expected to quickly land a job in her desired field of ecosystem management. She had a respectable grade point average as an environmental science major from one of the nation's top-rated public schools. She had participated in a climate science program at Oxford University in England and spent a summer working for an environmental conservation program in New Zealand. But after a fruitless five-month job search, she took a 20-hour-a-week position as a fragrance assistant at Macy's, making minimum wage. She moved into her parents' basement in Marshall, Mich. In April, 2014, she finally secured a job in her field as a lead horticulturist at a zoo. The job provided benefits, but paid only $12 an hour — still not enough for her to have her own place. It used to be that students looked upon college graduation with excitement — the beginning of a road full of promise and, ultimately, an exciting new career. But for many college graduates these days, it's quite the opposite. Despite a national unemployment rate of 3.7 percent, about the lowest it's been in 50 years, many young adults lack job prospects that mesh with their idealized vision of the post-college world. In 2018, 23 percent of those ages 25 to 29 were living in their parents' home, up from 17 percent in 2007, according to the National Center for Family and Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University. Crippling student loan debt often forces young people to move back home. According to the Pew Research Center, 53 percent of those with a bachelor's degree or higher have student loans and a quarter of those with debt owed $43,000 or more. A 2015 study by Jennifer Copp, an assistant professor at Florida State University, found that returning to a parent's home was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms among young adults experiencing employment problems. Maria Kefalas, a professor at St. Joseph's University who was part of the MacArthur Foundation's Research Network on the Transition to Adulthood, said moving back home creates a domino effect. ""If you can't afford your own place, you limit your job search to the opportunities in driving distance of your family home."" Courtship becomes challenging when you live in your parents' basement, she said. Dr. Kefalas has observed an increase in the number of recent college graduates who are having difficulty transitioning into the post-college world. She said some students are not using college effectively; many show up in the career office for the first time in their senior year, without immersing themselves in experiences throughout their college years that prepare them for the job market. A 2017 survey by Strada Education Network and Gallup of 32,000 students at 43 four-year institutions found that the vast majority of students feel unprepared to get a job after graduation; only a third of students believe they will graduate with the skills they need to succeed in the workplace, while just half believe their major will lead to a good job. Diane Hudson, director of the Certified Professional Career Coach Program, a certification of the Professional Association of Resume Writers & Career Coaches, said recent graduates today often lack the interpersonal skills needed to land a job. Reliance on social media and limited experience with face-to-face interaction means they no longer know ""how to properly shake a hand or look somebody in the eye. They have to learn social skills later."" Natascha F. Saunders, a career coach specializing in teens and adults who is based in Boston, said over-involved parents can hamper a job search. She recalls one parent who showed up with her child at a job interview. Ms. Saunders insisted she wait in the lobby, but the parent approached her daughter right afterward and wanted to know exactly what happened: what was said, what questions were asked and how she responded to those questions. Ms. Saunders said she has also seen parents attend career networking events geared to students and alumni. ""The parents mean well,"" she said. ""They want the best for their child, but their actions aren't helpful."" Maureen Tillman, a clinical social worker in Maplewood, N.J. who started College With Confidence & Beyond, a professional practice to help young adults become emotionally and financially independent after graduation, says many recent college graduates do not have resiliency skills ""as a result of being bubble-wrapped in high school and college"" by parents who want to protect them. Resilience is key in a stressful job market. Even though the unemployment rate for bachelor's degree recipients ages 20 to 29 is at 8.3 percent, the lowest it's been since 2007, Dr. Kefalas has seen ""disturbing trends in underemployment and stagnating wages."" The salaries her students earn after college aren't much higher than they were a decade ago. Competition for jobs can be fierce. On average, 250 people will apply for a job through a campus recruiting event. ""Hundreds of students are vying for one entry-level role. Employers are demanding more of the potential applicants. It's tough to get that particular job,"" Ms. Saunders said. Ms. Hanway can attest to that situation. Looking to better her credentials and increase her job prospects, she received a master's degree in environmental management at Duke University in May. ""I needed my bachelor's to get a job and my master's to get a job I could actually live on,"" she said. She applied for 40 jobs — she was one of 150 applicants for one she didn't get — but secured only four interviews. It doesn't help that many college graduates have set the bar high. Since childhood, many have internalized the self-esteem building message that they can do anything and should not settle. ""With that comes anxiety around whether they're doing enough or whether a job is good enough,"" said Kit Yarrow, a professor emeritus of psychology at Golden Gate University in San Francisco. Jeffrey Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., and author of ""Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties,"" observes that ""young people today have this universal aspiration to find a job that's more than just a way to make a living that is different than previous generations."" They're seeking a position that reflects their identity and aligns with their values, he said. But ""employers don't create jobs to fulfill a person's identity. They just need someone to do the job, so there's often a mismatch."" Ms. Hanway only applied for jobs that she felt would make a positive impact on the world. ""It limits your pool and they're lower paying, but it's still more moral than making a ton of money on Wall Street,"" she said. Young adults who are struggling aren't helped by the barrage of heavily curated social media posts that make it seem as if so many peers are succeeding, said Dr. Brian Primack, director of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health. He said nearly all young people use social media, and a study he published in 2017 showed those who use it often were the most lonely. A young adult who is in a more vulnerable state because of financial issues, a bad breakup or another kind of loss has a ""skewed perspective that is more likely to affect their sense of connectedness"" and potentially result in depression, anxiety and other problematic outcomes, he said. The takeaway of a vulnerable person scrolling through social media is often, ""I'm not having as happy and successful a life as all these people,"" he said. Despite the gloomy statistics, Dr. Arnett said he was heartened by findings in the Clark University Poll of Emerging Adults, a national survey he directs of 1,000 young adults ages 18 to 29, in which 89 percent said they were confident that they would eventually get what they wanted out of life. Dr. Kefalas agrees that it's not so much a failure to launch among young people today; it's a delayed launch. Life is looking less bleak these days for Ms. Hanway, now 28. In September, she finally got her dream job, as a science writer at her alma mater. She's now earning a salary of $52,000 plus full benefits. The day before her job started, she finally moved out of her parents' basement into a one-bedroom apartment.  ""It was a lot of work, but I did finally get there,"" she said."

One was the crisis of 2008, after which a lot of ordinary Americans turned their attention to the financial-services industry and discovered something that looked, on the surface, uncannily like a classic bilking: There was a lot of hard-to-follow shifting about of who owned what and who owed what to whom, and in the end a lot of people found that their retirement savings had vanished. The other was the election of Donald Trump, who has always been fairly open about his talent for old-school hucksterism. To the very end, many people were convinced his entire campaign had been a long-game self-promotional exercise — a man wandering past real estate, casinos, reality television, mail-order steaks and wealth-building seminars to arrive at right-wing politics as a high-quality grift. ""Grift"" and ""grifter"" are old-fashioned words, but ever more useful ones. ""Grift"" evokes not so much specific criminal acts as a broad, opportunistic racket, executed with a bit of cunning and panache. ""Grifter"" captures the kind of person who takes up such ploys as a trade, an art, a way of being. Both labels are constantly attached to Trump and his retinue. This year, Salon labeled the president the ""grifter in chief,"" and the late-night host Seth Meyers called him ""a grifter who surrounds himself with other grifters."" A Daily Beast headline gallantly allowed that ""Trump Is Not a 'Moron' — He's a Grifter, and He's Created an Administration of Grifters."" Representative Ted Lieu of California warned of the steady ""drip, drip, drip of grifting from Trump's appointees,"" and when Forbes looked into Wilbur Ross's business history, it concluded that ""the current United States secretary of commerce could rank among the biggest grifters in American history."" In Slate, Jacob Weisberg invented a parlor game to keep things straight: Which administration figures were grifters, and which were grafters? Grafters are stolid and conventional, lining their pockets and then quietly retreating to one of their several homes. Grifters are the ones with flair and ambition, who seem to delight in the con itself — the cleverness of the scheme, the smooth ease with which the marks were gulled. The grifter is a lot more entertaining, and this summer, con stories seemed to be everywhere — not because of any sudden renaissance of fraud, but because the media had tapped into a bottomless appetite for hearing about it. The blockbuster was the tale of Anna Sorokin, a.k.a. Anna Delvey, a European 20-something who managed to persuade New York socialites that she was a wealthy heiress, living out of Manhattan hotels on, reportedly, a series of forged documents and an air of general blitheness. (Both Shonda Rhimes and Lena Dunham are at work on TV adaptations.) And this was nearly nothing compared with Anthony Gignac, an orphan who spent decades impersonating a Saudi prince. According to an October story in Vanity Fair, he was exposed when, during the slow negotiation of a multimillion-dollar business deal, he raised suspicions by ordering prosciutto. The appeal of these stories is hardly mysterious. There you are, stuck at work, while others somehow declare themselves to be billionaires or airline pilots or Stanley Kubrick. We admire the gall, and often the craft — the cinematic complexity of a well-developed con, whether it involves high-wire role-playing or just chiseling petty cash out of passers-by. If you ever feel like the old-fashioned grift has gone the way of fast-talking men in hats and three-card Monte on street corners — the way of Harold Hill in ""The Music Man,"" commencing his 1912 grift with a rousing patter song about moral decay — all you have to do is Google terms along the lines of ""elaborate Walmart returns scheme"" to witness the American ingenuity still on offer. It was a treat to read the story, this summer, of how a security worker for the McDonald's Monopoly contest spent years filching winning tokens and finding co-conspirators to redeem them. We deplore this stuff, in theory, but under the right circumstances we are entranced by the audacity — at the hacker's skill of spotting the weak spots in the systems that bind the rest of us, and bluffing straight through them. A grift needn't be a crime. That's part of the word's appeal: It opens its arms to encompass any phenomenon that arrives in the rough shape of a racket, from online marketing to whole political movements. On the news site Splinter, the writer Alex Pareene has characterized much of modern conservatism as a grift gone wrong — pulling from the historian Rick Perlstein's 2012 Baffler article ""The Long Con,"" which traces out just how much of the movement's far-right fringe was born and nurtured in self-enriching direct-mail and media operations. The game here is simple: Persuade people that everything they value is under attack, and they can be soaked for donations; feed them conspiracy theories about the Federal Reserve and civil unrest, and they will become extraordinarily receptive to ads for bunker supplies and gold. A solid scheme, Pareene suggests, right up until you find that you've overagitated the marks, and they've started deciding party primaries. The personality type that responds to this sort of thing is, naturally, not restricted to the right. Trump's election opened the field for a parallel play among liberals, spurring the rise of the ""Resistance grifter"" — a type of social-media personality who shovels forth alarmist news and wild speculation about the president's perfidy, posing as a lonely hero standing against it and raking in donations or subscription money along the way. Telling people what they wanted to hear used to be part of the average grift; lately, thanks to social media and crowdfunding, it works beautifully as a grift in itself. Even if what you tell the world is sincere, something happens once you've started profiting from it — someone's bound to think you're playing everyone. After that article in July recapped the details of the 1990s Monopoly-token scheme, a few readers were offended to learn that its author was fed the idea by a film producer, who is now co-producing a big-money adaptation of the article — the same strategy he had used with high-profile films before. Was that a bit of a feint? This is the thing about grift-logic: It immediately radiates outward, by analogy, from literal scams to broad systems that merely have the same sensibility as a scam. Selling fake stereo equipment is a classic con; you can call the police about it. Selling iffy nutritional supplements, or tricking people into endless monthly payments on an impulse-buy rotisserie, is a touch safer; they'd have to write letters to the state attorney general. Clickbait publishers, unaccredited online education, apps that quietly harvest personal data, shady Amazon drop-shippers, patent trolls — these can all be legal, but what difference does it make? Once you begin to identify such arrangements as grifts, you are bound to discover, in our baroquely capitalist society, that loads of things are essentially grift-shaped, from oddball start-ups to arcane financial services: They begin with a slick appeal, go on to create nothing of concrete value and end, like any good bilking, with your money in new pockets. This line of thinking can, pretty obviously, be a glib one; to say something like ""capitalism is a grift"" is to express an intuition, not file a detailed indictment. Grift is capacious. In just five characters, it can casually point out the suspect mechanics and empty, grasping heart of almost any figure or phenomenon. Young people look at their paychecks and suspect that their college educations were a grift, or at least the student loans were. One Twitter skeptic smells grift in all of ""the business world,"" another in the artificial scarcity of diamonds, another in all skin care beyond sunscreen and acne medication, another in liberal podcasts, another in ""everything."" This might scan as terminally cynical, a way of sneering diffidently at, well, everything. But it's not exactly outlandish (or unpopular) for a modern person to note that many of the systems she encounters have been carefully constructed to extract maximum profits, to sustain themselves, to get what they can while the getting is good — not unusual for a modern person to suspect it would be easier to deal with an actual con artist than with Wells Fargo or a budget health-insurance company. And perhaps this is cause for despair. But over the course of the year, it has begun to feel that the energy behind calling everything a grift is the very opposite of jaded. You just need to turn your focus from the grift to the negative space around it. If huge segments of our economic activity manage to feel — aesthetically, if not legally — like fine-tuned rackets, then the segments that remain must consist of actual work with actual purpose, productive labor that requires no puffery or misdirection to sustain. This is the surprisingly wholesome, traditionalist set of values that sneering at grift inevitably pushes you toward: old-timey rectitude and integrity, honest work and firm handshakes and mutual respect. The opposite of a grift, you find, is creating things of real value, paying fair wages, asking what is right more than what is profitable. The opposite of grift is a square deal."

It was 2016, and he had just been elected as a soil and water conservation district supervisor in rural Bladen County, N.C. But he instead came before the State Board of Elections to fan fears of fraud and to air a protest about a race in which he had been victorious.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/us/politics/north-carolina-election-fraud.html,1459," ELIZABETHTOWN, N.C. — L. McCrae Dowless Jr. should have been celebrating. It was 2016, and he had just been elected as a soil and water conservation district supervisor in rural Bladen County, N.C. But he instead came before the State Board of Elections to fan fears of fraud and to air a protest about a race in which he had been victorious. ""I'm not saying there's any wrongdoing here,"" Mr. Dowless told the Raleigh-based board. ""I just want it investigated because it was a high volume of write-ins."" Only two years later, Mr. Dowless has gone from a Republican gadfly in North Carolina's incessant battles over voting rules and alleged fraud to being at the center of an escalating battle over disputed ballots that could overturn the House election in the Ninth Congressional District. Mr. Dowless, witnesses and party officials said, helped to oversee a voter turnout operation on behalf of the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, in which canvassers collected absentee ballots directly from residents — a violation of North Carolina law. Sworn statements from voters and unusual absentee voting statistics have stoked suspicions over whether ballots were fraudulently filled out for Mr. Harris or discarded if they were for his Democratic rival, Dan McCready. State regulators have refused to certify the preliminary results, which showed Mr. Harris with a 905-vote edge. If state officials find that the balloting was tainted enough to ""cast doubt"" on the results, they would have the power to order a new election. The dispute — and the identity of the Ninth District's next congressman — may not be settled for weeks. On Tuesday, Representative Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who is the incoming House majority leader, suggested that Democrats might refuse to seat Mr. Harris if concerns about the election remain. ""If there is what appears to be a very substantial question on the integrity of the election, we would oppose Mr. Harris being seated until that is resolved,"" said Mr. Hoyer, whose chamber has the constitutional authority to be ""the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members."" The House will likely take some of its cues from the findings of the sprawling inquiry that has begun in North Carolina, where elections regulators are poised to hold an evidentiary hearing this month. Investigators have prepared a batch of subpoenas, including one that they sought to serve Tuesday on the Charlotte-area consulting group that contracted with Mr. Dowless. They have questioned people about what Joshua Malcolm, who was named this week as the election board's chairman, described last week as ""claims of numerous irregularities and concerted fraudulent activities."" The known claims are concentrated in Bladen County, which has about 33,000 residents, and neighboring, far larger Robeson County. Bladen County, where elections officials work in a simple brick-and-glass building on South Cypress Street, just behind a shopping center with a Dollar General and a furniture store, recorded the state's highest rate of absentee ballot requests: 7.5 percent of registered voters, compared with less than 3 percent in most of the other 99 counties. A strikingly large number of those ballots, 40 percent, were never returned. In Robeson County, 62 percent were not returned. No other county had a rate higher than 27 percent. Mr. Harris won 61 percent of submitted absentee ballots in Bladen County, even though registered Republicans accounted for only 19 percent of the ballots submitted. Those statistics, coupled with the alleged and acknowledged machinations of Mr. Dowless, who has a felony record and a history of financial fraud, and his workers sparked what slowly swelled into another bitter electoral impasse in a state that seems perpetually engulfed by them. On Tuesday, the district attorney for the area, Jon David, said law enforcement officials were investigating allegations related to the 2016 elections and were in contact with each other ""to coordinate our efforts should a prosecution be warranted"" in the wake of this year's suspicions. Almost all the worries, for now, involve absentee ballots. In an affidavit, a Bladen County resident, Emma Shipman, wrote that she had recently handed over her ballot to a woman who told her that she was assigned to collect ballots in the district. Another voter wrote that she gave her incomplete ballot to a woman who promised she would finish it. State officials are also reviewing other claims. Mr. Malcolm, the elections board chairman, said Tuesday that the authorities would release documents on ""a rolling basis in a manner reasonably calculated to serve the public interest without compromising the investigation."" Perhaps no figure is more central to that inquiry — or the subject of more rumors and speculation — than Mr. Dowless, who was assigned to get-out-the-vote efforts in the eastern part of the Ninth District, which runs from Charlotte to east of Fayetteville. Mr. Dowless, 62, could not be reached for comment, and Red Dome Group, which hired him for Mr. Harris's campaign, did not respond to messages. Mr. Harris has said he will ""support any efforts to investigate allegations of irregularities and/or voter fraud, as long as it is fair and focuses on all political parties."" And although Republicans have threatened litigation to try to compel the state to certify the election results immediately, they have yet to bring a lawsuit. In enlisting Mr. Dowless, the Harris campaign's consultants signed on a man with some political knowledge but a blemished personal history. He was deeply familiar with the get-out-the-vote efforts on which candidates at all levels rely: State records show that beginning in 2009, at least seven Democratic and Republican candidates paid him for work in local and state races, including campaigns for the Legislature, district attorney and county sheriff. Separately, campaign finance records in Mecklenburg County showed that Mr. Dowless worked for a City Council candidate in Charlotte, the state's largest city. ""He was just a known figure,"" said former State Representative Ken Waddell, a Democrat who hired Mr. Dowless after receiving a recommendation. ""To me, it appeared like he just liked politics."" Mr. Waddell had no complaints about Mr. Dowless's integrity during the campaign, but recalled disagreements about where to place signs in the district. Years earlier, though, Mr. Dowless's character had come into question after one of his employees died in an automobile accident. The Fayetteville Observer reported in 1991 that Mr. Dowless and the woman he eventually married had, after the employee's death, taken out a six-figure life insurance policy in the man's name by forging a signature and backdating a document. Mr. Dowless listed himself as the primary beneficiary and collected benefits. Mr. Dowless was eventually sentenced to a short prison term, and state records show convictions for, among other offenses, perjury and fraud. But after prison, Mr. Dowless pursued, at least in part, a life in politics. As a Democrat, he sought a seat on the local school board in 2014 and was defeated in a primary. He was unaffiliated when he ran for the soil and water conservation district board in 2016 and switched his party registration to Republican after the election. The election results, though, had raised concerns in and around Bladen County. Although Mr. Dowless was running unopposed, about a third of the vote went to write-in candidates. Encouraged and aided by the chairman of the county Republican Party at the time, he submitted a protest to the state and argued that there was ""a pattern of fraudulent ballots."" But Mr. Dowless did not appear to know all that much about it when the state elections board convened a hearing. Asked for the name of the lawyer who helped him to prepare his protest, Mr. Dowless recalled him only as ""Steve."" (The lawyer also represented Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican whose bid for re-election would soon end in a narrow defeat.) Asked whether he knew how to obtain the financial disclosure reports of the political action committee that he, in his protest, had suggested was behind ""a massive scheme to run an absentee ballot mill,"" Mr. Dowless said he did not. At one point, a member of the board pointedly asked, ""Are you familiar with your protest?"" Mr. Dowless, who invoked the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination when he chose not to answer a question, said that he was. The board's questioning eventually raised concerns about Mr. Dowless's own efforts to pursue absentee ballots in 2016 and prompted the attention of law enforcement officials. The board dismissed the protest because of ""a lack of substantial evidence of a violation of election law or other irregularity or misconduct sufficient to cast doubt on the results of the election."" The same standard will apply now, as the state board, itself jolted and upended by political turbulence in recent years, decides how to referee North Carolina's latest electoral storm."
News,2018-12-04,"I work at a nonprofit that advocates for consumer rights and financial literacy, a mission I have been proud to serve. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/magazine/should-a-nonprofit-splurge-on-management.html,1132," I work at a nonprofit that advocates for consumer rights and financial literacy, a mission I have been proud to serve.  We recently suffered a financial crisis of our own. Due to changing federal policies, among other factors, we lost a chunk of our annual budget. Management decided to cut about a quarter of the staff to protect our long-term future.  I was of course saddened by what happened, but I understood that there were no good options. Then a staff member who was laid off (and quickly found a new job) told me that senior managers' salaries made up nearly a quarter of the budget and that we were paying for a ""company car"" for our president. In addition, a former manager is paid an exorbitant hourly rate for consulting.  All of this hurt to hear. Our leaders sacrificed dozens of direct-service jobs that impact our clients' lives but seemingly not their own relatively large salaries and fringe benefits. I am considering quitting in protest. (I am sure that the board is aware of the pay structure, so I doubt they will be of help.) I have also considered informing the media, but I don't know what the ethical response is to what I see as an injustice to our fired colleagues and a violation of our mission. Name Withheld Our economy is warmly solicitous toward people at the top of the income hierarchy, icily indifferent toward those in the middle and at the bottom. The Economic Policy Institute says that last year the C.E.O.s of the largest 350 companies in the United States were paid on average 300 times as much as their average employee. And the nonprofit sector, given that it competes for talent with the for-profit sector, isn't going to be entirely exempt from the trend. Your organization is obliged to serve its mission as well as it can with the resources it can muster. To do so, it needs good staff and good management — which requires it to be mindful of what the market rate is for people with the skills it needs. (Nonprofits typically do comparative analyses of salaries in their sector when considering raises for top management.) At the same time, income is just one factor that draws employees; often staff members will work for less when they find the work genuinely rewarding. Especially given the particular mission of your nonprofit, the situation sounds worrisome, and it might indeed have been a good idea to appeal to those at the top to accept cuts in salary in order to reduce the number of frontline employees who were let go. It might also have been better to end a consulting contract than to fire a permanent employee. Both would be harder than layoffs at the bottom, because board members are likely to be personally closer to senior managers (and former managers) than to other employees. Still, it's their responsibility to weigh such options. None of these considerations, however, prove that the leadership made the wrong decision. When the budget shrinks, personnel decisions have to take account of the employment market. Suppose cutting your president's perks or pay would incline her to take a job elsewhere. (Though that car sounds like something most places wouldn't offer.) The cost to your organization of finding a new one, especially during a rocky period, might mean that it wasn't worth the risk. A fixed, across-the-board reduction in salary, defined in percentage terms, might simply produce an organization full of disgruntled people waiting for a better opportunity. It's conceivable, too, that the core competences of the organization lie in the best-paid people and that the less well paid would be easier to replace if and when funds return. You should feel free to talk to the media if you've determined that a nonprofit devoted to financial literacy has made bad financial decisions. But to know that, you would have to be privy to the details. Are you? You say that senior managers ""seemingly"" didn't cut their own earnings — which makes it sound as if you might not be. The inequality in rewards between top and bottom is ultimately a structural problem that requires structural solutions. Several countries in Europe have chosen to deal with it by having higher taxes and more generous transfers to the less well off than we do, ensuring that their income inequality is much less than ours. Those lower-paid people laid off by your organization would have better unemployment insurance there, too. My point here is that the issues you raise aren't really local to your organization. If we want to do something about them, resigning in protest from your nonprofit probably isn't the answer. I was on a three-month study-abroad program for about a month before I changed my ticket to leave within a week. My partner's mother was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer a few weeks before I left for my trip. The treatment did not appear to be working, and the cancer continued to spread.  My partner and I have been together for three years, and before I left, I promised that if things got worse, I would come home. I made good on that promise, but I feel incredibly guilty. I feel guilty for leaving my program early because my parents paid for it, and I am unlikely to get a refund. My partner's mother was also upset that I came home early, but I felt a responsibility to support my partner and make her my priority. I feel like I let my professors and parents down, that I was playing into the stereotype of a young adult making hasty decisions. My father was incredibly supportive, but I still feel anxious. I know I could never have enjoyed myself there with the worry and sadness I was feeling for my significant other. Did I do the right thing? Name Withheld Love is a mode of care, the philosopher Harry Frankfurt has argued, that shapes your preferences and guides your conduct via ""a practical concern for what is good for the beloved."" To feel love for someone is to take his or her interests as your own. It doesn't answer to reasons; rather, in Frankfurt's formula, ""it creates reasons."" The moral nature of love, accordingly, may require sacrifices. Even if — as realism requires me to point out — your partner may not end up permanently in your life, such calculations are going to be alien to who you are as a loving person. Yes, the human and financial costs to you and your family will be substantial, but nothing you are doing involves irreversible loss. Your partner's mother, who is perhaps feeling guilty for derailing your studies, may second-guess you. But your father hasn't. And neither will I."

And then the death of George H.W Bush — the only presidential candidate whose campaign I volunteered for (as a letter-stuffer in 1988) — reminded me that there was a time when our presidents were dignified, presidential, decent and public-spirited. Does Bush's passing cause you to rethink the way you viewed him when he was in office? Gail Collins: I realized a long time ago I'd underestimated him — maybe when I started comparing him to his son, the walking foreign policy disaster. And now, of course, every former president looks great compared with Donald Trump. If Warren Harding had died this week, we'd all have been thinking: ""Well sure his Secretary of the Interior went to jail, but compared to Donald Trump …"" Bret: Agreed. James Baker was right when he said Bush 41 was the best one-term president we've ever had. The largely peaceful collapse of the Soviet Union. The successful reunification of Germany. Lightning victory in the gulf war. The end of the Noriega regime in Panama. The negotiation of NAFTA. The Americans with Disabilities Act. Also, the complete absence of malice. Bush 41 was probably the last president who refused to govern in a state of remorseless partisan war with his opponents. Obviously that wasn't true of his political campaigns, particularly against Mike Dukakis in 1988, but it did typify his time in office. It's almost hard to imagine that we could recover that style of politics. With that in mind, what are you looking forward to when Democrats take over the House come January? Gail: Infrastructure. Lots and lots of talk about infrastructure. One of the very few things both parties in Congress and the president agree on is that infrastructure is … good. Don't know that they'll get any farther than that, but if anything happens I'm thinking it'll be about road repair. Here in New York we have a desperate, critical need to get a new train tunnel under the Hudson River. The existing ones are in terrible shape and if either ever has to be closed down, it'll be a major blow to the economy of the city, the region and the country. So far Trump just hasn't gotten on board. Reliable sources tell me it's because he doesn't want to pay a lot of money for something people can't see. Anything you hope Congress will or won't do? Bret: An immigration bill. But, yeah, infrastructure first. I say this with some reluctance, ideologically speaking. I think a lot of huge infrastructure projects are boondoggles of dubious long-term economic value — even if they create jobs while they are being built. And, as we've learned from the Second Avenue subway misadventure, it's easy to inflate costs massively when the taxpayer is footing the bill and government isn't controlling the costs. That said, every time I go through Penn Station I'm reminded of how awful our rail lines are next to every other developed country. And any time I fly from JFK to Hong Kong or another Asian destination I feel as if I'm departing from the 20th century and arriving in the 22nd. So, yes, infrastructure. Gail: I've always suspected that many conservatives hate mass transit because it just fundamentally offends their sense of individualism. That you can't be the heroic American Man Who Rides Alone if you're sitting in a car with 40 other people making multiple stops in New Jersey. But go on. Bret: There's more than a little something to that. As for immigration, I liked our colleague Tom Friedman's formulation from his column the other day: ""A high wall with a big gate."" Not because I think the wall is such a great idea — the money would be better spent on personnel and technology, not concrete — but because I think it is a price worth paying for a path to citizenship for the Dreamers, an expanded H1-B program for high-skilled immigrants and their spouses, and other steps to make immigration to the United States fairer, safer and easier for every law-abiding person who wants to come and make this a better country. Gail: Good luck getting that past the president. And if we want to resolve the border issues, there's also going to have to be a very big effort to fuel economic development in Central America. This really isn't a problem about Mexicans anymore so much as impoverished refugees from the violence and hunger of countries like Honduras. Bret: Agreed. We need some version of a ""Plan Colombia"" for Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, modeled on the military and financial assistance the United States gave to Bogotá that successfully helped Colombians get the upper hand against insurgents and drug cartels. And that's another one for the ""good luck getting it past the president"" file. Gail: But here's something I've been meaning to ask you about: the report on global warming. The president just won't buy the idea that it's happening. I suspect that's why he was so nuts about the California fires — he was babbling about raking the forests because he didn't want to go near the real issue. We haven't talked about global warming in a long time. Any reactions? Bret: Given the topic, I guess the first thing I should say, yet again, is that I do not dispute the science that climate change is happening and that much of it is man-made. And Trump and his administration should simply acknowledge the fact. I'm less clear, say, that we should attribute events like the devastating forest fires to climate change alone as opposed to a host of additional causes, including too many people living in fire-prone areas (and often causing the fires), as well as poor forest-management practices. I'm also skeptical that we have any genuinely practical solutions right now to climate change — at least solutions that don't create environmental or political problems of their own. ""Do something"" may be an emotionally satisfying statement, but it's a lousy guide to policy. I was reminded of this the other while reading a fascinating piece in The Times Magazine about the ecological devastation wrought by biofuels — which were seen as part of the climate-change cure just a few years ago. The riots in France sparked by the government's climate-related hike to diesel fuel taxes are also a reminder that the term ""climate sensitivity"" should be a political term as well as an ecological one. Gail: It's true that overdevelopment is one of the causes of the California fires — as well as all the terrible flooding in places like Florida and Texas. Interesting that the president never mentions that. Bret: We could do a lot to discourage people from living in places they shouldn't be in the first place, for instance by ending or reforming the National Flood Insurance Program. Gail: Totally agree about the flood insurance. But not about your suggestion that just saying ""Do something"" is the worst possible response to global warming concerns. Worst possible response is to gut the existing regulations and then just say, ""Wait and see."" Bret: Agree partially. The ethanol subsidies have been a fiasco. Cap-and-trade systems are prone to corruption. A carbon tax probably makes the most sense but tends to be regressive. My own view is that reinvesting in nuclear plants makes the most sense from an environmental and technological point of view, so long as you can reform the regulatory picture to make them economical. Gail: If you're worried about solutions that create problems of their own, there's the one about getting rid of the radioactive waste. One of the reasons I'm in the ""Do something"" camp is because there are plenty of strategies that would be helpful even if they didn't turn out to do much over the long run for the global warming. We already mentioned mass transit, controlling overdevelopment of beaches and other fragile areas. Reducing car emissions makes the air better. Encouraging the solar heating industry and wind power gives us an economic boost. And if I go on I will wind up once again pointing out that the worst possible approach is the one the president is taking — overturning the existing anti-warming regulations and shrugging his shoulders as if the whole issue was slightly less important than the weekend golfing schedule. We spend a lot of time jointly beating up on Trump: Is there anything he's doing that you'd want to praise with a little holiday-season cheer? Bret: Let me think …. …. thinking. …. thinking. Ah, O.K. Well, he didn't completely wreck free trade this week, though the new NAFTA is worse than the old one and it isn't clear it can get congressional approval. So I guess I'm mildly cheered that he has almost prevented a disaster he needlessly caused. What about you? Anything to like? Gail: Well … I do appreciate he doesn't come back to New York for weekends any more. We've got enough traffic jams from the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. Speaking of trees, I have to admit I've never been more fascinated with White House holiday decorations than this year. Those blood-red pseudo-firs are truly memorable. And sort of perfect for an administration that so frequently makes the nation go, ""Yipes!"" Bret: This is the new third-rail of American politics: Melania. And Melania's taste. For reasons I don't quite get, liberals and conservatives seem to have made some kind of tacit pact not to criticize her or her choices as first lady. They weren't so kind to Hillary Clinton. But here goes: that was the tackiest White House Christmas display ever. Of all time. It looked to me as if Derek Zoolander had been brought in as style consultant. And that he, in turn, had subcontracted the task to Imelda Marcos. It looked like a staging for an avant-garde version of Federico García Lorca's ""Bodas de Sangre."" It looked — if looks could sing — as if ""White Christmas"" were being performed by Ozzy Osbourne just as he bit the head off a bat. It looked as if John Bolton had been chosen to perform an exorcism, sadly not on the president. Otherwise: pure class! Gail: O.K., that is the best interior decorating critique of the year. On the Trump plus side, the National Football League will be happy to know that, thanks to the president, I have developed a modest affection for professional sports. You have to live in Trumpland all week, but on the weekends you can turn it all off and watch people tossing balls around. You go to a party and rather than depressing everybody with talk of the latest tweets, you can just say ""Hey, how about those Giants?"" Or Rams or Bears or whatever animal mascot you like. Bret: Poor Bears. Shoulda beaten the Giants on Sunday. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
News,2018-12-04,"BRUSSELS — In a major speech on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to explain one of the abiding conundrums of the Trump administration: How does a nationalist lead on the international stage?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/world/europe/pompeo-brussels-speech.html,1104," BRUSSELS — In a major speech on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to explain one of the abiding conundrums of the Trump administration: How does a nationalist lead on the international stage? The answer, he said, is to revamp or jettison some treaties and institutions while bolstering others. Among the institutions that Mr. Pompeo criticized were the United Nations, the European Union, the Organization of American States and the African Union. But he embraced NATO, which President Trump has harshly criticized, as an ""indispensable institution."" The speech, delivered in a palatial hall in Brussels, was intended to explain Mr. Trump's worldview to a deeply skeptical audience, including many Europeans who see Mr. Trump as undermining international agreements that have kept the peace in Europe and enhanced prosperity. ""Even our European friends sometimes say we're not acting in the free world's interest. This is just plain wrong,"" Mr. Pompeo said, adding that ""under President Trump, we are not abandoning international leadership or our friends in the international system. Indeed, quite the contrary."" But since the end of the Cold War, the international order ""failed us, and it failed you,"" he said. ""Multilateralism has become viewed as an end unto itself. The more treaties we sign, the safer we supposedly are. The more bureaucrats we have, the better the job gets done."" Of the United Nations, he asked, ""Does it continue to serve its mission faithfully?"" Mr. Pompeo called Britain's decision to leave the European Union a ""political wake-up call"" for the bloc, which is based in Brussels. He then asked whether the European Union ""is ensuring that the interests of countries and their citizens are placed before those of bureaucrats here in Brussels?"" Someone in the audience shouted an unequivocal, ""Yes,"" a response Mr. Pompeo ignored. The World Bank, International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization also came in for sharp criticism. ""International bodies must help facilitate cooperation that bolsters the security and values of the free world, or they must be reformed or eliminated,"" he said. After the short speech, Mr. Pompeo took no questions. Responses ranged from tepid to hostile. In addition to Mr. Trump's regular criticism of NATO, the United States and the European Union are fiercely at odds over the Iran nuclear deal, which Mr. Trump has pulled out of while America's main European allies seek to preserve it. Washington and Brussels are also engaged in sometimes vicious negotiations about trade as well as American sanctions on European steel on the grounds of ""national security."" The Trump administration is also threatening new tariffs on imported cars, in an effort to reduce the American trade deficit with the European Union. And Washington has sharply criticized Germany for supporting the Nordstream II, a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany now under construction. Mr. Pompeo's challenge to the European Union was a surprisingly undiplomatic comment from America's chief diplomat. A spokesman for the European Union disputed the claim that the bloc fails the member states and their people. Margaritis Schinas, chief spokesman of the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, explained its governing structure and system of popular elections, adding pointedly, ""I'm simplifying for those who do not know us."" ""That's how it works, O.K.?"" Mr. Schinas said, throwing his hands in the air. ""So for those people who come to Brussels and coin an opinion without knowing how our system works, that's how our system works, and that's our reply."" Ian Lesser, director of the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, which organized the event, said: ""Clearly this was a speech intended to signal that multilateralism wasn't dead, it simply needed to be revived."" ""I don't think it was a destructive message about multilateralism per se,"" he said. Some listeners were less sanguine, like David Fouquet, a professor at the Free University of Brussels. ""I was struck by the fact that he put the European Union on his administration's hit list of bad actors,"" he said. ""I'm in disbelief: the tone, the lack of sensitivity to the place where he was."" ""His predecessors built and created these institutions,"" Mr. Fouquet said. ""Although he professes to want to strengthen them, I think he is undermining them."" Mr. Pompeo's audience listened for clues about the future of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, known as the I.N.F. treaty, which the Trump administration has threatened to jettison despite European opposition. For years, American officials have maintained that Russia was violating the treaty, which banned land-based missiles of certain ranges. ""When treaties are broken, the violators must be confronted, and the treaties must be fixed or discarded,"" Mr. Pompeo said, in a preview of a threat he delivered hours later to walk away from the agreement if Russia fails to correct violations. Mr. Lesser said that ""for now I heard no sign suggesting that America is prepared to go back on its apparent commitment to withdraw from the nuclear treaty, unless of course something happens on the Russian side, but I don't think that's very likely."" Mr. Pompeo said that some international institutions ""work in American interests and yours, in service of our shared values."" He listed only three such bodies: NATO, the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, the bank messaging service known as Swift. John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, threatened to penalize Swift, which gives financial institutions a secure way to wire money around the world, if it did not remove Iran's banks from the system. Despite opposition from the European Union, Swift acceded to American demands. ""This is an excellent example of an international institution acting responsibly,"" Mr. Pompeo said. Although NATO also received praise from Mr. Pompeo, he repeated Mr. Trump's frequent complaint that the other 27 nations in the alliance need to spend more on defense. He then announced that he would host foreign ministers in Washington in April to celebrate the alliance's 70th anniversary. It would be the first time that a major NATO birthday was celebrated without heads of state. NATO officials said that there may be another summit meeting of leaders later in the year that could be portrayed as timed for the anniversary. In closing, Mr. Pompeo cited a quote from George Marshall, who as secretary of state after World War II helped design the modern international system, declaring that ""international action cannot replace self-help."" ""It's not popular to buck the status quo,"" Mr. Pompeo said. ""But too much is at stake not to. This is the reality which President Trump so viscerally understands."" ""President Trump knows that when America leads, peace and prosperity follow,"" he added."
News,2018-12-04,Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/business/dealbook/the-weed-industry-may-be-better-off-without-the-support-of-big-tobacco.html,408," Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Big ambitions require investment, but not all infusions of capital are equal. Cronos, the Canadian pot producer, is in early talks with the tobacco giant Altria, Reuters reported on Monday. An association with a huge tobacco company isn't exactly what this nascent industry needs. To say that Cronos has expansion plans is an understatement. It wants to grow its production of weed to more than 258,000 pounds a year — equivalent to just less than $900 million a year in revenue terms, based on its latest realized price per ounce. In the last quarter it sold just 1,133 pounds. That's not to say that the Cronos chief executive Michael Gorenstein can't hit that target — but anyone buying his company's shares, or those of equally driven rivals, is effectively getting some greenhouses and nurseries, supply agreements and a lot of hope. Altria can take that risk. With a stock market capitalization of over $100 billion, it could swallow the $1.8 billion Cronos with virtually no financial impact. (Never mind that Cronos trades at more than 20 times its projected revenue for 2019, according to estimates from the data provider Refinitiv.) And for the tobacco industry, which has more enemies than friends, diversification makes sense — much like Altria's potential investment in the vaping company Juul Labs, reported by The Wall Street Journal last week. The trouble is, cannabis isn't quite like tobacco, nor should it want to be seen that way. Producers aspire for their product to be seen as medicinal rather than lethal, for one. In the future a lot of cannabis won't be smoked but eaten, taken as oils or even applied as cosmetics. Moreover, pot growers would prefer not to be regulated in the same draconian way as tobacco. Canada has already imposed strict curbs on how weed companies present logos and branding. In most U.S. states where usage is legal, a more liberal approach so far prevails. In some cases, weed producers can be selective. Canopy Growth in August announced a $4 billion investment from the brewer Constellation Brands, targeting a North American infused-beverage market that analysts from Berenberg Bank think could be worth $13.2 billion. Others might turn to pharmaceuticals companies, or even personal-goods makers. Tobacco companies have cash and urgency, but their unmistakable aroma is something that Big Weed can do without."
Op-Ed,2018-12-05,"I have this feeling that the 2020 presidential election in the United States will be unlike any in my lifetime — and not only because it will likely involve Donald Trump running as an incumbent — he alone is a one-man, three-ring circus — but also because the huge issue that should have been the focus of the 2016 election will be unavoidable by 2020. That is: How do we govern the “Next America’’?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/opinion/the-next-america.html,1148," I have this feeling that the 2020 presidential election in the United States will be unlike any in my lifetime — and not only because it will likely involve Donald Trump running as an incumbent — he alone is a one-man, three-ring circus — but also because the huge issue that should have been the focus of the 2016 election will be unavoidable by 2020. That is: How do we govern the ""Next America''? ""You know William Gibson's line, 'The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed'? Well, the future is here, and now it's starting to really get distributed. This is the Next America. But our institutions and political parties have not adapted to it,'' Gautam Mukunda, a Harvard Kennedy School Research Fellow and the author of ""Indispensable: When Leaders Really Matter,'' remarked in an interview. By 2020, it will be impossible to ignore the Next America. ""The basic premises of how the economy works have shifted under our feet and the government will have to respond.'' This Next America will raise a whole web of new intertwined policy, legal, moral, ethical and privacy issues because of changes in technology, demographics, the environment and globalization that are reaching critical mass. Where do I start? A good place is with 5G — fifth-generation wireless systems. With the two telecom giants Verizon and AT&T now beginning to deploy 5G technology across the country, the metabolism of business, entertainment, education and health care will dramatically accelerate in the Next America, beginning around … 2020. Getting the most from artificial intelligence and machine learning — like deploying self-driving vehicles — requires quickly transmitting massive amounts of data with very low latency. We will have that capacity in the Next America. With 5G, a Hollywood movie that now takes six or seven minutes to download onto your iPad will take six or seven seconds and microsensors in your shirt will gather intelligence and broadcast vital signs to your doctor. As AT&T notes in one of its 5G ads, ""Think of this as the next frontier in untethering, giving you the ability to take the ultrafast experience you have in your home or business with you virtually anywhere.'' It could be as revolutionary as the internet.  But it will require all kinds of new regulations to govern applications from self-driving cars to drone delivery systems to robots that will work as security guards and home health aides. An Associated Press report on Monday said that the government estimated there were currently ""about 110,000 commercial drones operating in U. S. airspace, and the number is expected to soar to about 450,000 in 2022.'' All of this new technology will have important implications for the education-to-work pipeline. My friend Heather E. McGowan, a future-of-work strategist, puts it this way: ""The old model of work was three life blocks: Get an education. Use that education for 40 years. And then retire. We then made the faulty assumption that the next new model would be: Get an education. Use it for 20 years. Then get retrained. Then use that for 20 more years and then retire.'' But in fact, in the Next America, argues McGowan, the right model will be ""continuous lifelong learning'' — because when the pace of change is accelerating, ""the fastest-growing companies and most resilient workers will be those who learn faster than their competition."" That means that in addition to our traditional big safety nets — Social Security and Medicare — we will need new national trampolines. We will need to make some level of postsecondary education free to every American who meets a minimum grade and attendance requirement, so that every adult and every high school graduate can earn an associate degree or technical certificate free of tuition at a community college at any time. Tennessee has already done that. These same technological transformations mean the Next America will require changes in antitrust policy. Since the 1980s, antitrust policy judged if a company was getting too big largely by one question: Was the loss of competition hurting consumers through higher prices or fewer services? ""But that definition is increasingly irrelevant in an age in which the most powerful companies in the world offer products and services for 'free' in exchange for personal data,"" Rana Foroohar, the Financial Times technology columnist, noted in a June 24 essay. ""This has provoked calls for a return to the definition of monopoly in the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which emphasizes the need to ensure that the economic power of large companies does not result in the corruption of the political process.'' That's because we are more than consumers, ""we're citizens,'' notes Mukunda, ""We have interests that stretch far beyond consumer pricing, and it's the job of the government to protect citizens' liberty, not just consumers' interests. It says so right in the Constitution, and we've forgotten that.'' Just one person — Mark Zuckerberg — controls Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. The fact that he has shown himself to be much more interested in scaling his platforms than combating those who abused them for political and economic gain — and that his lieutenants were ready to go after their high-profile critics, like George Soros — should make breaking up or regulating Facebook a front-and-center issue in 2020. But just the raw political weight of behemoths like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple needs a closer look. The Next America is more than technology. It literally will be born in 2020. The United States Census Bureau has predicted that by 2020, for the first time, ""more than half of the nation's children are expected to be part of a minority race or ethnic group."" That will begin a process by which by 2044 ""no one racial or ethnic group will dominate the U.S. in terms of size,"" NPR reported. Alas, though, the fiscal tools we need to build the Next America have been weakened by President Trump's tax cuts. The federal deficit was not supposed to hit $1 trillion until 2020, but the White House now says it will hit that number in 2019. We've had deficits this size in response to the 2008 financial crisis, but we've never run one so huge during a boom. That means the Next America may have to be built in the face of higher interest rates on more debt, with less fiscal ammunition to stimulate the economy should it slow down or face a crisis. So the Next America may very likely have to raise taxes or trim military spending, or Social Security or Medicare — just when all the baby boomers are retiring. In sum, the Next America requires addressing each of those issues, and many more — from climate change to zoning rules — and how they interact. So the next election must too. The craziness around Trump has delayed much of this discussion. But 2020 won't let us do that again. The Next America won't wait.

News,2018-12-05,"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — On a wintry day, Michael R. Bloomberg stood in black tassel loafers in melting snow while he inspected solar panels on a rooftop, then said he would make climate change “the issue” of the 2020 presidential race.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/us/politics/bloomberg-iowa-2020.html,930," CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — On a wintry day, Michael R. Bloomberg stood in black tassel loafers in melting snow while he inspected solar panels on a rooftop, then said he would make climate change ""the issue"" of the 2020 presidential race. Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who is mulling a run for president, was blunt about his determination to combat the impact of human activity on the environment, and he made clear once again his willingness to take on the coal industry. ""I've been very active in closing coal-fired power plants,"" Mr. Bloomberg boasted when asked whether a candidate whose top concern is climate change could appeal to voters in the regions like eastern Ohio who helped put President Trump in the White House. While praising Iowa's corn-based ethanol as an intermediary fuel needed in the short run, Mr. Bloomberg said it was well past time to cut coal entirely from the energy picture. ""One thing that shouldn't be part of the mix at all now is coal,"" he said. It was reminiscent of a comment that came to haunt Hillary Clinton in 2016, when she said her policies would put many coal miners out of work — a stance diametrically opposed to that ofMr. Trump, who made reinvigorating the coal industry a centerpiece of his economic message. While touring a company that installs solar panels in Cedar Rapids, Mr. Bloomberg, 76, attacked President Trump's rejection of his administration's own report about the dire economic costs from climate change. ""If you don't believe in science, I don't know what to tell you,"" he said. ""I guess when you need a doctor, you go to a witch doctor or something."" Mr. Bloomberg was making his first foray of the 2020 campaign to Iowa on Tuesday, though he was by no means the earliest bird to the state with the first nominating contest. With the state's caucuses still 14 months away, the website Iowa Starting Line has tracked more than two dozen potential Democratic contenders who have already visited. A billionaire philanthropist, Mr. Bloomberg arrived for four appearances in Iowaafter playing a major financial role in his party's broad midterm successes. The largess included a $250,000 donation to the Iowa Democratic Party for its statewide campaigns, said Matt Paul, an Iowa operative who helped arrange Mr. Bloomberg's visit. Some of Mr. Bloomberg's policies as mayor of New York, such as support for stop-and-frisk policing and opposition to Wall Street regulations, are at cross-purposes with progressives in his party, who have a large influence in Iowa. But Mr. Paul, who directed Mrs. Clinton's Iowa campaign in 2016, played downthose conflicts. He said Iowa Democrats were looking for the candidate who could best make Mr. Trump a one-term president. ""What matters most to them is winning,"" he said. ""I think '16 may have been a race about the résumé; '20 is going to be about victory."" Once a competitive battleground in presidential elections, Iowa was won decisively by Mr. Trump in 2016, sending Democrats into a deep funk. The 2018 midterms brought them partial redemption. Democrats flipped two congressional seats, although their nominee for governor lost to the incumbent Republican, Kim Reynolds. The 2018 election underscored Democrats' weakness outside of major cities and university towns. Pete D'Alessandro, a top Iowa adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 caucuses, said Mr. Bloomberg would not have any problem appealing to progressives. His challenge, like that of all Democratic contenders, would come in second-tier cities like Davenport and Marshalltown, blue-collar strongholds that fell fully under Mr. Trump's sway in 2016. ""Mike Bloomberg would do very well in Des Moines,"" Mr. D'Alessandro said. ""So would Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden or whoever. But how does Mike Bloomberg do in the small cities? ""Is he willing to not get into a limo, but get in a Jeep and drive to Marshalltown? That's a lot of work."" Mr. Bloomberg had a jam-packed schedule on his one-day visit. He toured an electrical contractor that installs solar panels, and met with students at a community college studying wind technology. In the evening he met in Des Moines with Moms Demand Action, the gun-control group he supports financially, and appeared at a preview of a climate change movie he bankrolled, ""Paris to Pittsburgh."" Before he spoke at the screening, Mr. Bloomberg was interrupted by a dozen or so protesters from the Democratic Socialists of America, who accused him of being ""Donald Trump lite"" and insufficiently green because he supports fracking as a transitional option on the road to clean energy. As the protesters were led out by the police, Mr. Bloomberg joked that it was like being back in New York, and said he would meet with them. ""People want recognition and respect,"" he said. ""I'm happy to give them that."" The field of potential 2020 Democrats highlighting climate change as a central issue is crowded. On Monday, Mr. Sanders led a town hall event on the topic that was broadcast on social media from Washington, in which he called global warming ""the great crisis facing our planet and facing humanity."" It is an issue that especially concerns young people, who flexed their muscles in the midterms, turning out in higher numbers than in any off-year election in the past quarter-century, according to one estimate. On the second issue he is most passionate about, gun safety, Mr. Bloomberg took a stance that might make it hard for many moderate Iowans to follow him. ""I think if you have children at home maybe you shouldn't have a gun,"" he said. ""That's just too dangerous."""
News,2018-12-05,"When the first big free-agent domino fell on Tuesday, the biggest surprise was not that Patrick Corbin landed a six-year, $140 million contract, it was the team with which he signed it.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/sports/patrick-corbin-nationals.html,880," When the first big free-agent domino fell on Tuesday, the biggest surprise was not that Patrick Corbin landed a six-year, $140 million contract, it was the team with which he signed it. Corbin, the top pitcher on the market, did not sign with the two suitors close to his hometown in upstate New York: the Philadelphia Phillies, whose owner was prepared to spend ""stupid"" money over the winter, and the Yankees, who have written the book on it. Instead, the Washington Nationals landed Corbin, a 29-year-old left-hander. The Nationals were flush with cash — the expiring contracts of Bryce Harper, Daniel Murphy, Gio Gonzalez and Matt Wieters free nearly $62 million from their payroll — and probably fueled by last season's collapse, they were willing to outbid the competition by adding a sixth year to the offer. Corbin, for his part, also gave a little, allowing the Nationals, as is their habit, to defer some of the money, according to a baseball official familiar with the agreement. The deal sends a signal that is heartening for baseball: At least in the National League East, most everyone is trying to win. The division champion Atlanta Braves landed third baseman Josh Donaldson, the American League Most Valuable Player three years ago, on a one-year, $23 million flier. The Mets acquired an elite closer in Edwin Diaz and an aging middle-of-the-lineup bat in Robinson Cano. And while the Phillies may have lost out on Corbin, they should be in the chase for the premier free agents in this class: Manny Machado and Harper. In Washington, Corbin joins a rotation where he will be third fiddle — behind Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg, who are down for $37 million and $38 million next season. Those are the types of salaries that used to regularly dot the Yankees' ledger. Sometimes it was money well spent (C. C. Sabathia) and sometimes it was not (Jacoby Ellsbury), but the deals had at least one commonality: They reinforced the notion that the only bottom line that mattered was winning the World Series. Now it is no longer so. Fiscal responsibility reigns. The Yankees, though they did take on what remained of Giancarlo Stanton's 13-year, $325 million contract last December, went through financial contortions to stay below the luxury tax threshold for the first time last season. General Manager Brian Cashman has said that he has been given a budget by Hal Steinbrenner, but has declined to say if it is above the new luxury tax threshold of $206 million, which is $9 million more than last season. The Yankees have occasionally lost out on free agents over the years — Greg Maddux didn't care much for New York, and Curt Schilling was intrigued by the possibility of ending the Red Sox playoff drought — but it is exceedingly rare for them to pursue one of the top players on the market and be outbid. About the only example that comes to mind is Cano, whom the Yankees were wary of committing to for 10 years. The Yankees made a similar calculus with Corbin, whom they viewed as a very good pitcher — they had tried to trade for him last winter — but one who had several middling seasons after Tommy John surgery before blossoming last season. He was 11-7 with a 3.15 earned run average, making the All-Star team and finishing fifth in the N.L. Cy Young voting. The Yankees liked Corbin plenty, but they did not view him as a top-of-the-rotation pitcher and thus did not want to give him a sixth year. Their final offer, according to a baseball official familiar with the negotiation, was five years and $100 million. So, instead of reading tea leaves last week — the order of Corbin's visits was Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and the report that Corbin's brother put on a Yankees cap while delivering a toast at Corbin's wedding — it was better to have listened. Cashman was asked on Friday, a day after Corbin's visit, if he was waiting on Corbin as a primary target. ""There's a lot of players of interest to us and a lot of players that can improve us, both in free agency and trade, so I wouldn't designate anyone as a primary,"" Cashman said. ""There's a lot of attractive players that are available for various price points."" Now the Yankees will pivot. Their pursuit of pitching to augment Luis Severino, Masahiro Tanaka and Sabathia already resulted in a trade with Seattle for James Paxton, and will now shift toward the next-level free agents — Dallas Keuchel, Nathan Eovaldi and J. A. Happ — and what could be a robust trade market with Cleveland's Corey Kluber headlining it. Only time will tell if the Yankees were wise not to invest in Corbin. Cashman has been shrewd in rebuilding the Yankees through their farm system, but his reluctance to take on the salary of Justin Verlander two years ago and — to a lesser degree — his unwillingness to part with a prospect like Miguel Andujar to land Gerrit Cole loom as what-ifs. But there was no equivocation about what happened on Tuesday. If this season's Yankees do win the franchise's 28th World Series title, it will not have been at any cost."
News,2018-12-05,"WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser, helped substantially with the special counsel’s investigation and should receive little to no prison time for lying to federal investigators, prosecutors said on Tuesday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/us/politics/michael-flynn-special-counsel-sentencing-memo.html,1316," WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn, President Trump's first national security adviser, helped substantially with the special counsel's investigation and should receive little to no prison time for lying to federal investigators, prosecutors said on Tuesday. Mr. Flynn was a key cooperator who helped the Justice Department with several investigations, prosecutors for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, said. He sat for 19 interviews with Mr. Mueller's office and other prosecutors and handed over documents and communications, they said. ""His early cooperation was particularly valuable because he was one of the few people with long-term and firsthand insight"" into the subject of Mr. Mueller's investigation — Russia's election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired, prosecutors wrote in a sentencing recommendation memorandum and an addendum that was heavily blacked out. In particular, they wrote, he might have prompted others to cooperate with the inquiry. ""The defendant's decision to plead guilty and cooperate likely affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming,"" prosecutors said. They also indicated that Mr. Flynn helped with other investigations without revealing details about them. Mr. Flynn, who served briefly as the president's national security adviser, is the only White House aide and the first person from the president's inner circle to strike a cooperation deal with the special counsel's office in exchange for a more lenient penalty. He pleaded guilty a year ago to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time, Sergey I. Kislyak. ""The defendant deserves credit for accepting responsibility in a timely fashion and substantially assisting the government,"" prosecutors wrote. The cases of some other former Trump aides caught up in the special counsel investigation are also nearing resolution, marking an active week for Mr. Mueller's inquiry. By Friday, Mr. Mueller's prosecutors are due to enumerate how they believe Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, violated a plea agreement and separately to outline the extent of cooperation by Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's longtime lawyer and fixer. Another longtime Trump associate whom Mr. Mueller is scrutinizing, Roger J. Stone Jr., said on Tuesday that he had invoked his the Fifth Amendment rights in response to a request from Democratic investigators for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hand over documents and testimony relevant to their own Russia inquiry. Mr. Stone's lawyer, Grant J. Smith, said the committee's request was ""overbroad"" and stressed that Mr. Stone was ""an innocent citizen who denounces secrecy."" The letter was dated Monday, the same day that Mr. Trump praised Mr. Stone on Twitter for having the ""guts"" to stand up to Mr. Mueller. Mr. Stone's lawyer said that the letter was sent before Mr. Trump's tweet. A grand jury in Washington has been investigating whether Mr. Stone had any advance knowledge of how WikiLeaks planned to use documents stolen from Democratic computers by Russian agents during the 2016 presidential campaign. Prosecutors said Mr. Flynn's more than 33 years of military service — he was a three-star Army general before being fired as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 — should be taken into account when Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia sentences him on Dec. 18. But they also noted he should have known better than to lie to the F.B.I. ""Senior government leaders should be held to the highest standards,"" they wrote. Close observers of Mr. Mueller's investigation had hoped his team might provide revealing details about possible cooperation between Trump associates and Russia, but in typical fashion, the special counsel's office kept its cards closely held. Though the lack of details suggested that Mr. Mueller's investigation remains active, one of the president's personal lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, seized on it to underscore that Mr. Mueller had yet to prove any Trump associates conspired with Russia's campaign of disruption. ""This is what we get for $30 million and two years of an investigation and no evidence of collusion, and we get a process charge?"" he said, referring to Mr. Flynn's plea of lying to the F.B.I. and rounding up the estimated costs of the special counsel inquiry. Mr. Flynn, who gained notoriety after he left the military for his view of Islamic terrorism as an existential threat to the United States, began advising the Trump campaign in early 2016. About a week after his surprise election victory, Mr. Trump named Mr. Flynn as his future national security adviser. During the presidential transition, Mr. Flynn discussed with Mr. Kislyak a coming United Nations Security Council vote on whether to condemn Israel's building of settlements. At the time, the Obama administration was preparing to allow a Security Council vote on the matter. The two men also spoke about sanctions imposed by the Obama administration on Russia over its election interference in December 2016. Mr. Flynn asked that Moscow refrain from escalating the situation, and Mr. Kislyak said Russia ""had chosen to moderate its response."" Just days after Mr. Trump's inauguration in January 2017, Mr. Flynn was interviewed by the F.B.I. as part of the investigation into Russia's influence campaign in the 2016 election. During the interview, Mr. Flynn lied to agents, a crime that carries up to five years in prison. At the time, the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned the White House that Mr. Flynn might be compromised by the Russians. Why Mr. Flynn chose to lie about his and Mr. Kislyak's discussions remains a mystery to the F.B.I. officials who investigated the case. Before investigators interviewed Mr. Flynn at the White House, he had indicated to a senior F.B.I. official that he knew the United States had been listening to Mr. Kislyak's calls, former law enforcement officials said. Mr. Mueller's prosecutors gave no indication about why he lied. Mr. Flynn's own memo to seek a light sentence in the case is due by Dec. 11. Mr. Flynn served only 24 days as national security adviser. He was forced to resign as the White House cited his failure to be forthcoming with Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Flynn has largely remained out of news headlines since taking the plea deal a year ago. And Mr. Trump has said little about him since, even as he lashed out at other former aides who agreed to cooperate with investigators in exchange for lighter punishments. ""I've seen it many times,"" the president told ""Fox & Friends"" in August after Mr. Manafort was convicted of financial fraud and Mr. Cohen agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. ""I've had many friends involved in this stuff; it's called flipping, and it almost ought to be illegal. It's not a fair thing."" After being fired  by President Barack Obama in 2014 after repeated clashes with other administration officials about his job performance, Mr. Flynn went on to form his own consulting company. Among his clients was Turkey, which paid him more than a half-million dollars to target Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey believes that Mr. Gulen and his supporters were behind a failed coup attempt in 2016 and has repeatedly demanded the United States extradite Mr. Gulen, who fled Turkey 1999. On Election Day in 2016, Mr. Flynn published an op-ed article in The Hill, a newspaper serving Congress, calling Mr. Gulen ""a shady Islamic mullah"" and a ""radical Islamist."" Prosecutors did not charge Mr. Flynn with crimes related to his work on behalf of the Turkish government. But in documents, they have made clear that they have evidence that Mr. Flynn ""made materially false statements and omissions"" in his federal filings about that lobbying work. They admonished Mr. Flynn in Tuesday's memo for concealing his work for Turkey, saying it kept the public in the dark about the extent of its efforts to influence public opinion about the failed coup."

The drops in Asia and Europe came after stocks on Wall Street fell more than 3 percent on Tuesday. But global investors appeared to be calmer than their counterparts in the United States, after official comments by the Chinese government that were vague but nevertheless expressed confidence that talks between the two countries would yield a positive outcome. In Britain, France and Germany, stocks fell 0.6 percent, 1.4 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. In Hong Kong and in Taipei, Taiwan, investors sent the market down roughly 1.6 percent. Markets in Seoul, South Korea, and Tokyo finished slightly more than half a percent lower. China's currency, the renminbi, weakened slightly, by 0.3 percent, against the United States dollar on Wednesday. It trades within a band set by the People's Bank of China. It had reached a two-month peak earlier this week. Futures contracts that predict the performance of stocks in the United States indicated that shares there would rise when markets reopen on Thursday. They were to be closed on Wednesday in observance of the death of former President George Bush. Conflicting signals on the trade front have sent investors on a wild ride this week. Just two days ago  stocks rode a wave of optimism up after Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China agreed a truce over dinner in Buenos Aires on the sidelines of the G20 meeting. Since then, the White House has offered a mixed message about what, exactly, the two sides have agreed to. Mr. Trump has also chosen a trade hard-liner to lead the next round of talks. China's Ministry of Commerce has said negotiations would follow a timeline. The two sides have 90 days to work out a resolution. The biggest concern plaguing investors is that an extended trade war could erode global growth just as the world's biggest economies are already starting to cool. In China, there are increasing worries that the dispute will weigh on an economy that is under stress from a plunging stock market, a weakening currency and dampened consumer appetite. ""While investing we try to avoid the noise, but these trade war issues in China and Japan have the potential of such large impact on certain industries it's increasingly difficult to ignore,"" said Seth Fischer, the chief investment officer at Oasis Management, a hedge fund based in Hong Kong. Mr. Fischer was referring to potential tariffs on the automobile industry that could affect the entire supply chain across Asia. Mr. Trump referred to himself in one tweet on Tuesday as ""a Tariff Man"" In another, he wrote, ""We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China, or no deal at all — at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States."" Investors in the United States sent Treasury yields sharply down on Tuesday, a sign of broader concerns about growth. The difference between short- and long-term interest rates reached its lowest point since before the financial crisis. Some expect that long-term interest rates could soon fall below those short-term rates, a phenomenon known as an inversion of the yield curve. Inversions are closely watched by investors, as they have a good track record of correctly predicting recessions."

Brussels — supported by the rest of the governments of Europe — seems to believe that Rome will soon back down, delivering another victory for European Union discipline. But that's far from certain. Moreover, even if the Italian government does fall into line, the political consequences may prove disastrous for Europe. However the drama ends, Europe is playing a dangerous game. The confrontation began in October, when the government in Rome put forward a draft of its budget for 2019, which proposed an increase to Italy's deficit. On Oct. 23, the European Commission rejected the budget — an unprecedented move. Since then, Brussels has initiated steps to penalize Italy under the European Union's strict excess-deficit rules. Italy's real financial problem, however, is not the annual budget shortfall but the country's mountain of outstanding debt, running to a total of 2.6 trillion euros, most of which was piled up decades ago by political parties that no longer exist. Today the debt burden hovers around 133 percent of gross domestic product. Debts at this level can easily become unsustainable, growing faster than the income necessary to repay them. The debt is widely held by banks inside and outside Italy. A scenario in which Italy had difficulty meeting its financing needs would deal a shattering blow to Europe's fragile financial system. Given this delicate balance, there is little room for error. Every opportunity must be taken to lower the ratio of debt to G.D.P. With the eurozone's having experienced a modest recovery since 2013, and even Italy's economy growing again, the European Commission argues that Italy should tighten its belt. Rome demurs. Of course, no government wants to embrace cuts. But there is a more basic point here: For the commission to declare Italy fit to make budget cuts just because the country has seen some growth is in glaring contradiction to actual economic and political conditions. Over the past 10 years, Italy's gross domestic product per capita has fallen. This decline is unique among large advanced economies. (It is even worse than Japan's infamous lost decades.) And the suffering is extremely unevenly distributed: More than 32 percent of Italy's young people are unemployed. The gloom, disappointment and frustration are undeniable. For the commission to declare that this is a time for austerity flies in the face of a reality that for many Italians is closer to a personal and national emergency. The two parties that make up the current Italian government, the League and the Five Star Movement, were elected in March to address this crisis. The League is xenophobic; Five Star is erratic and zany. But the economic programs on which they campaigned are hardly outlandish. The League wants tax cuts for its core constituency of small businesses. Five Star wants a minimum income guarantee for its voters in Italy's poorer southern regions. Both want to coddle Italy's pensioners. These proposals will increase the deficit. But at the same time, Rome argues, they will deliver a much-needed stimulus. How much stimulus is the key question. The Italian government's budget forecasts are optimistic. But others, including the Bank of Italy and the Peterson Institute of International Economics, warn that Italy is caught in a trap: Anxieties about debt sustainability mean that any stimulus has the perverse effect of driving up interest rates, squeezing bank lending and reducing growth. During the eurozone crisis, economists at Bocconi University in Milan popularized the idea of ""expansionary austerity:"" government spending cuts stimulating confidence and growth. The years after the financial crisis showed how wrong that was. Now economists seem to have a new meme: contractionary fiscal expansion, stimulus that negates itself by undermining confidence and pushing up interest rates. Either way, these arguments are not decisive. Even on the European Commission's pessimistic assumptions, the deficits proposed by Rome wouldn't send the debt burden out of control. What would tip Italy into real crisis would be a sudden upward adjustment in yields not to 3 percent but to 5 percent or more. If that were to happen, caused by a shock to the market's confidence in Italy, there would be an explosive surge in debt service costs. The government could find itself shut out of funding markets. Italy's banks would require support from the European Union. Help would be forthcoming only after agreement on a deficit-cutting package. Barring that, Italy could find itself on the way out of the eurozone. This risk is what makes the confrontation between Rome and the commission so worrying. The game of chicken could easily spook the markets. Currently, market confidence is still supported by European Central Bank bond purchases. In 2019 the E.C.B.'s outgoing president, Mario Draghi, a longtime advocate of Italian discipline, is stopping the bank's bond buying. Tension is set to rise. The European Commission is, of course, bound to defend its rules. But how does the European Union expect the confrontation to play out? Brussels has a limited range of sanctions at its disposal. Unlike Greece, which was a net recipient of European Union largess, Italy is a net contributor to the European Union's budget. It won't be easy to make penalties and fines stick. It will therefore have to be the markets that deliver the discipline. But that is a terrifying prospect: Not only is Italy's debt huge, but Italy's banks are not minnows, either. Italy is both too big to fail and too big to bail. So what is the game plan? If the commission is gambling that the budget crisis will force Italy's government to fold, what direction does it imagine the government folding in? The last time Italy's public debt was in the eurozone's spotlight was in the fall of 2011. Then, the resolution was political: Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was toppled in favor of the unelected technocrat Mario Monti. Mr. Monti was the darling of the markets. But back home, public outrage against the suspension of normal democratic procedures helped to trigger the upsurge of the Five Star Movement, which culminated with its taking 32 percent of the vote in March. The European Commission can hardly wish to repeat that cycle. On the back of its election victory, Five Star was the senior partner in the coalition formed in May. But the balance of power has shifted. While Five Star's popularity has slid, support for the League has doubled to 34 percent. The League is a party of northern Italian small business. It is far from keen on Five Star's plans to increase welfare for the south. A League-dominated reshuffle that dropped Five Star's expensive minimum-income guarantee would go a long way to meeting the financial demands of the European Commission. The new government might even find common ground with Brussels on issues of ""supply-side reform."" That would no doubt reassure investors, but it would be a disastrous outcome for the European Union, handing a political victory to Matteo Salvini, Italy's deputy prime minister, who makes no secret of his desire to remake Europe as an arena of neo-nationalist, nativist politics. If strengthening the League is not the commission's intention, perhaps Brussels is hoping for a tactical withdrawal by Rome. A face-saving compromise may yet be arranged over the expensive pension proposals. If the government crumbles, perhaps a new election might yield a more compliant majority. But this is, to say the least, a high-risk and negative strategy. Above all it fails to address the deep sense of crisis in Italy. If the European Union is determined to hold the line on debt and deficits, it should offer something positive in exchange, such as a common European investment and growth strategy or a more cooperative approach to the refugee question, which has driven the upsurge in the League. If all Brussels has to offer is discipline, it is inviting the remaking of Italian politics along lines that are more nationalist and more hostile to Europe.

But two of its assumptions — that government controls stifle economic growth, and that the internet cannot be tamed — were quickly proven wrong.  Nearly 40 years later, China rivals the United States as a global superpower. Its continued success is challenging not just the West's assumptions about China, but the West's assumptions about itself. If you'd like to start from the beginning of this series, listen to Part 1 here. On today's episode: Philip P. Pan, the Asia editor for The New York Times. Background reading: In a five-part series, The Times examined how China became a superpower. It began by writing its own playbook for economic development and offering an unspoken pact with its people. Read the series opener here. China's financial boost to Hollywood comes with strings attached.

News,2018-12-05,Good Wednesday. Want this by email? Sign up here.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/business/dealbook/trump-trade-china.html,1927," Good Wednesday. Want this by email? Sign up here. It's a bird … It's a plane … It's ""Tariff Man,"" as President Trump dubbed himself in one of several provocative tweets he posted on Tuesday. And it seems that this superhero's special power may be an uncanny ability to get in his own way. Uncertainty hangs over the U.S.-China trade deal. Other than the 90-day postponement of further tariffs, it's unclear what was agreed to by Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires on Saturday. Bloomberg compared the diverging claims from Beijing and Washington, and it seems there's little agreement between the two sides. Mr. Trump may have overstated China's concessions. Michael Pillsbury, the former Pentagon official Mr. Trump has called ""probably the leading authority on China,"" told Axios that there was concern in China about American reports of concessions that Beijing never agreed to. They include the Chinese ""immediately"" addressing intellectual property theft, resuming purchases of American agricultural products and cutting car tariffs. And he continues to be bullish on the prospects for a pact. ""The negotiations with China have already started,"" Mr. Trump said on Twitter, and those leading the talks will see ""whether or not a REAL deal with China is actually possible."" His conclusion: ""If it is, we will get it done,"" he added. ""But if not remember, I am a Tariff Man."" But China may be starting to make moves. Beijing offered its first acknowledgment of the 90-day deadline, saying it was ""confident in implementing"" trade commitments to the U.S. ""as soon as possible."" Bloomberg notes that China is preparing to import U.S. soybeans and liquefied natural gas. Reuters reports that the Chinese oil trader Unipec plans to resume U.S. crude shipments to China in March. And China announced new punishments for intellectual property theft. That was fast. A day after stocks rallied after the announcement of a truce in the U.S.-China trade war, they bombed again: The S&P 500 lost more than 3 percent on Tuesday. But don't believe anyone who points to a single reason for the rout. Trade issues have a lot to do with it. Investors worry that the trade war is far from over, and that an extended dispute would undermine global growth and hurt American companies. As Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said yesterday, the markets are in a ""wait and see"" period while investors try to determine whether an actual trade deal can be struck. You can also blame the inverting yield curve. Part of the curve, which shows the difference between interest rates on short- and long-term government bonds, went negative on Monday, which is often considered a sign of a looming recession. That helped drive S&P 500 bank shares down 4.4 percent, making Tuesday their worst day since February. And there's more. Bloomberg points out that worries about the housing market, continuing volatility in the tech sector, the uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union and numerous other issues also weighed on the markets yesterday. But things might brighten. While global markets followed the U.S. sell-off overnight, futures tracking U.S. stocks are all ticking up this morning, most likely because of positive comments on trade by the Chinese government. (The U.S. markets are closed today in honor of former President George Bush, whose funeral will be held at Washington National Cathedral at 11 a.m. Eastern; they reopen on Thursday.) The draft of a report prepared for the board of CBS by lawyers for the company, and seen by the NYT, contains a series of new allegations against Mr. Moonves, CBS's former chief executive. The report says the company has justification to deny him $120 million in severance. Among the revelations in the document: • Mr. Moonves ""engaged in multiple acts of serious nonconsensual sexual misconduct in and outside of the workplace, both before and after he came to CBS in 1995."" Some of those allegations had not been previously disclosed. • Lawyers involved in the inquiry spoke with Mr. Moonves four times and found him to be ""evasive and untruthful at times, and to have deliberately lied about and minimized the extent of his sexual misconduct."" • Investigators determined that Mr. Moonves had ""received oral sex from at least 4 CBS employees under circumstances that sound transactional and improper to the extent that there was no hint of any relationship, romance or reciprocity."" The report also explains what the CBS board and management knew about Mr. Moonves's conduct. More on what that means from the NYT columnist James B. Stewart: Many of the company's employees, including high-ranking executives and even members of its board, were aware of the former chief executive Leslie Moonves's alleged sexual misconduct and subsequent efforts to conceal it. Yet no one acted to stop him — and the repercussions for that failure are likely to reverberate at CBS for years. President Trump repeatedly accused Amazon in the spring of engaging in a ""scam"" against the United States Postal Service. On Tuesday, his administration delivered its verdict: not really. More on that from Jim Tankersley of the NYT: The task force created by Mr. Trump to investigate the Postal Service's finances did conclude that the mail system is losing money. But a report issued on Tuesday said that commercial package delivery for Amazon and other e-commerce retailers was actually profitable for the Postal Service and was not costing the United States ""massive amounts of money,"" as Mr. Trump has suggested in his tweets. Commercial package delivery is not profitable enough to offset the revenue losses the Postal Service is suffering, however, as Americans mail fewer and fewer first-class letters. The report did recommend some changes: that the Postal Service change the price of package delivery to maximize profit instead of maximizing delivery volume, and that it create separate accounting books for letters and for packages, among other things. Such changes could increase delivery prices, making online retailers nervous. It's been two weeks since Mr. Ghosn, who led an alliance comprising Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, was arrested in Japan, and there hasn't been much clarity on how he might have sneaked $70 million of salary and benefits past the company that pays him, as he is suspected of doing. Now Jason Clenfield and Yuki Hagiwara of Bloomberg explain how he might have done that: What is certain is that Nissan Motor Co.'s own corporate governance rules gave unusual powers to its former chairman, a business celebrity who was given extraordinary deference for having once rescued the automaker from financial ruin. Those powers included near-total say over how much — and how — he was paid, according to Nissan's own internal rules. Several people familiar with the prosecutors' investigation now say the probe appears to hinge on a relatively arcane point of accounting — whether retirement payments were properly booked. The Bloomberg report also points to questionable governance at Nissan, with a concentration of power at the top and independent board members, including an ""ex-race-car driver and former model,"" who may not have been qualified to ask searching questions of the leadership team. The golden years of leisure after decades of toil are beginning to look very different, depending on where in the world you live and, increasingly, which generation you belong to. That's according to Katie Robertson of the NYT, writing in a special section of the newspaper about the future of retirement. Things look bleak. ""Nearly half of those surveyed in a recent report by the Aegon Center for Longevity and Retirement say future generations would be worse off than those now in retirement, partly because people are living longer. According to the United Nations, the number of those over 60 worldwide is expected to double by 2050 to 2.1 billion."" What needs to change? ""A new global retirement model would need to include universal access to a retirement savings system for workers, greater financial literacy and affordable health care, among other solutions.""

News,2018-12-05,"PARIS — Too little, too late: That was the reaction of the so-called Yellow Vest protesters to the French government’s sudden retreat this week on a gas tax increase.

The Yellow Vests, who have thrown France into turmoil with violent protests in recent weeks, say they want more, and they want it sooner rather than later — lower taxes, higher salaries, freedom from gnawing financial fear, and a better life. Those deeper demands, the government's inability to keep up, and fierce resentment of prosperous and successful cities run like an electrified wire connecting populist uprisings in the West, including in Britain, Italy, the United States and, to a lesser extent, Central Europe. What ties these uprisings together, beyond the demands, is a rejection of existing parties, unions and government institutions that are seen as incapable of channeling the depth of their grievances or of offering a bulwark against economic insecurity. But what makes France's revolt different is that it has not followed the usual populist playbook. It is not tethered to a political party, let alone to a right-wing one. It is not focusing on race or migration, and those issues do not appear on the Yellow Vests' list of complaints. It is not led by a single fire-breathing leader. Nationalism is not on the agenda. The uprising is instead mostly organic, spontaneous and self-determined. It is mostly about economic class. It is about the inability to pay the bills. In that regard, it is more Occupy than Orban — more akin to the protests against Wall Street driven by the working poor in the United States than the race-based, flag-waving of Hungary's increasingly authoritarian leader, Viktor Orban. In Paris, it was the luxury shopping streets, the Avenue Kleber and the Rue de Rivoli — insolent symbols of urban privilege compared with the drab provinces from which the Yellow Vests emerged — where windows were smashed on Saturday. But it is also about a deep distrust of societal institutions that are perceived as working against the interests of the citizens, and that will make this crisis particularly hard for the government to resolve. The Yellow Vests push politicians away and reject Socialists, the far right, President Emmanuel Macron's political movement, and everybody else in between. The movement was ""totally unanticipated by the parties,'' said the political scientist Dominique Reynié. ''The system is in crisis."" In fact, so far at least, France's movement remains relatively unstructured. It has yet to be hijacked by either the far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen, or the far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, try as they might to claim ownership. And that is what makes France's movement unique, compared with, say, the Five Star Movement in Italy, which grew up out of a similar disgust with political parties and a distrust of elites, and which has held itself out as the authentic expression of the popular will. But Five Star was always less movement than new-age political party. While organized over the internet, it was led by prominent figures (Beppe Grillo, for one) as well as more obscure ones (the Casaleggios) who stoked, channeled and harnessed the popular discontent from the start. Much the same can be said of the now-floundering U.K. Independence Party in Britain, which gave voice to Brexit and the public's rejection of European Union structures, as well as its class divides with London. Or for that matter, of President Trump, who demonstrates contempt for institutions. His rural and exurban supporters agree with him. ""It is the same fear, anger and anxiety in France, Italy and the United Kingdom,"" said Enrico Letta, a former prime minister of Italy who now teaches at Sciences Po university in Paris. ""These three countries have the highest level of class slippage,"" he said. For the 30 years after World War II, ""they were at the top of the world,"" Mr. Letta said, ""at the very center."" These countries ""used to live with a very high level of average well-being,"" he said. ""Now, there is a great fear of seeing it all slip away."" That fear transcends all others. Thus, in Italy, Five-Star's proposal for a ""citizens' income,"" or guaranteed income like an unemployment benefit, helped the movement conquer the impoverished south. In Britain, Brexit was sold partly as an escape from the perceived crippling of financial constraints from the European Union. ""There's this social distress that exists more or less everywhere,"" said Marc Lazar, a specialist in Italian history at Sciences Po. ""Of people who are very worried about the future, not only are they suffering, but they have profound distrust of institutions and political parties. This is what we are seeing everywhere in Europe."" Comparing the four countries — Britain, France, Italy and the United States — Christophe Guilluy, a French geographer who has studied the demographics of the ""left-behinds,"" said ""the sociology of the people in revolt is the same."" ""These are the people who feel endangered by the current economic model,"" which doesn't ""integrate the greatest number,"" he said. In France, fury at the perceived distance of the executive has not helped the government. ""The president has not once spoken to the French,"" the Yellow Vest spokesman Éric Drouet said on French TV on Tuesday, referring to Mr. Macron's relative silence over the last week. ""There's a total denial by our president."" There is a paradox in the current French standoff, as Mr. Macron's rise was itself predicated on sweeping away existing political parties, and on a rejection of traditional intermediaries like labor unions. His campaign book was called Revolution, and it expressed a kind of contempt for the parties that had handed off power to each other for 50 years. Mr. Macron, by personalizing power and rejecting what had come before, helped create the world of institutional weakness in which the Yellow Vests are now flourishing. But his base, then and now, was exceedingly small, presaging his current wide rejection by the French, not just by the Yellow Vests. He won only 24 percent of the vote in the first round of voting last year — while his opponents on the far right and far left together won over 40 percent of the vote. Those numbers have now come home to haunt Mr. Macron in a political landscape where nearly eight out of 10 French citizens no longer support him, according to a recent poll. Mr. Macron, it turns out, is also a change agent out of step with the times, just as France's long delay in biting off structural economic overhauls has left it out of sync with its Western cohort. He is now trying to push through reforms to make France more business-friendly and competitive, as Britain did in the 1980s and Germany in the 1990s. Meanwhile, the global backlash is already cresting, fueled by the income disparities those changes ushered in. The partial sacking of Paris's rich, tourism-dominated districts last weekend was merely the physical expression of what all these movements feel deeply, in the view of analysts: hatred of the ""winners"" in the global system, symbolized by urban elites. ""It's the provinces against Paris, the proud and contemptuous capital,"" Mr. Reynié said. ""And Paris has never been so dissimilar to the rest of France. The fracture is very, very sharp."" The combination of discontent and distrust has made the Yellow Vests an expanding force that almost certainly has yet to reach its limits. The protest has already changed from a revolt over a small gas tax increase to demands for higher salaries, and more. ""Right now, give us more purchasing power,"" Jean-François Barnaba, a Yellow Vest spokesman in the Indre administrative department, told BFM TV on Tuesday. ""The gas tax was only the beginning,"" said Tony Roussel, a spokesman for the movement in Marseille. ""Now there are all the other taxes. There are salaries. There is the minimum wage."" The government's response is especially fraught. On the one hand, top officials express sympathy, not daring otherwise as polls show wide support for the movement; on the other, the same officials are angry and exasperated over the violent challenge to France's institutional structure. The result is a kind of paralysis, halting adjustments that are only likely to invite more challenges. ""They still haven't understood our demands,"" Mr. Roussel said by telephone this week. ""This was like a firecracker in the water,"" he said of the government's decision to suspend a planned gas tax for at least six months. The protests will go on, he vowed — until deeper concessions are made."
News,2018-12-05,Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/business/dealbook/china-venture-capital.html,370," Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ China's venture capital party may be about to get quieter. This year, for the first time, Chinese start-ups raised more cash than their Silicon Valley counterparts, notching up $56 billion in six months. But the excitement may be cooling as the year ends, thanks to tougher regulation and a slowing economy. A shakeout could easily follow. It has been a blowout 2018. For the first half of the year, a study released this week by the data provider Preqin and Insead business school suggests that China beat the $42 billion raised in the United States by some way. That's largely thanks to a huge funding round for Alibaba's financial affiliate, Ant Financial, as well as some other chunky efforts. But it's a high-water mark regardless. As is, perhaps, SoftBank's mooted move to place a team in China to help spend its giant Vision Fund, after years of investing remotely. The coming months look less exuberant. The likes of SoftBank and Singapore's Temasek still have plenty of money to plow into splashy names like the news and video-sharing app ByteDance. Others are less enthusiastic, if figures for China-focused venture funds are anything to go by. In the 11 months to mid-November, around 70 such funds raised just over $15 billion, Preqin estimates; that compares to $40 billion or so raised by 330 funds in all of 2016. All of this suggests increased nerves. The vast majority of Chinese unicorns that listed this year, including the takeaways-to-taxis app Meituan Dianping and the smartphone-maker Xiaomi, are now underwater. Just a small fraction of those $1 billion-plus companies, including video-streaming companies Huya, Bilibili and iQiyi, have risen above their initial public offering prices. Rocky starts like that of the Alibaba-backed parenting site Babytree, which debuted last month at a valuation below its last funding round, won't help. What most of this year's debutantes have in common is that they bet on local consumers, one way or another. But those shoppers look more fretful. Changes to rules on education, fintech and gaming have only added to the strain. Weaker companies may fall by the wayside."
News,2018-12-06,"In a move meant to stabilize an organization still reeling, and barely standing, in the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, U.S.A. Gymnastics filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday in Indianapolis.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/sports/usa-gymnastics-bankruptcy.html,665," In a move meant to stabilize an organization still reeling, and barely standing, in the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, U.S.A. Gymnastics filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday in Indianapolis. Kathryn Carson, the federation's newly elected chairwoman, characterized the bankruptcy filing as a reorganization, ""not a liquidation,"" of the federation, which oversees the sport of gymnastics in the United States. More than 300 plaintiffs, including Olympic gymnasts, have sued U.S.A. Gymnastics for failing to protect them from Nassar, the former national team doctor, and the mediation process with some of Nassar's victims was ""not moving at any pace,"" Carson said. She said she believed the bankruptcy, which was filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the southern district of Indiana, will hasten claim payments to all the plaintiffs. ""We owe it to the survivors to resolve, fully and finally, claims based on the horrific acts of the past and, through this process, seek to expedite resolution and help them move forward,"" she said in a statement. In a financial report earlier this year, auditors for U.S.A. Gymnastics estimated the potential cost of the federation's litigation to be between $75 million and $150 million, though lawyers involved in the lawsuits say those numbers are laughably low. Carson said payouts to victims would be covered by insurance, and those payouts won't be affected by the bankruptcy filing. Besides the insurance money, she said the federation has ""no other significant assets"" to pay the victims. In Wednesday's bankruptcy filing, the organization listed its liabilities and its assets each at between $50 million and $100 million. The filing on Wednesday also might stop the United States Olympic Committee from decertifying U.S.A. Gymnastics, a process it began last month in order to strip the organization of its power as a governing body. The U.S.O.C. began the decertification process because it believed the federation had made too many missteps — including in its widely criticized choices for the chief executive position in the post-Nassar era — and had proven incapable of running itself properly. A U.S.O.C. spokesman, Patrick Sandusky, said his organization was reviewing the bankruptcy filing to see how it would affect the decertification process. He said it's the U.S.O.C.'s job to ensure that each sports federation ""has the capacity and capability to prove the support, protection and services that we expect for all Olympic athletes in the United States."" However the bankruptcy filing affects the organization, its lawsuits and its ability to remain in charge of gymnastics in the United States, there is a deadline for U.S.A. Gymnastics to stabilize itself: The Tokyo 2020 Summer Games are less than two years away, and gymnastics is one of the United States' marquee sports. It also features one of the United States' biggest Olympic stars, Simone Biles, who is slated to lead the Americans as they look to win their third straight Olympic gold medal in the team event. By then, U.S.A. Gymnastics will need major sponsors. Its main supporters fled the organization after the Nassar scandal broke in 2016. Carson said the bankruptcy filing and subsequent resolution of the claims against the federation ""are the first critical steps in rebuilding the community's trust."" That trust needs to be rebuilt with potential sponsors, too. John Manly, the lawyer for many of Nassar's victims, was upset that the bankruptcy filing would end all discovery and depositions in the lawsuits against U.S.A. Gymnastics. He believes that would be a devastating development in the pursuit of who knew what and when in the abuse case. According to Manly, it's now up to Congress and law enforcement to pursue the matter, so Nassar's enablers could eventually face punishment. ""The leadership of U.S.A. Gymnastics has proved itself to be morally and financially bankrupt,"" he said, adding that the federation is ""incapable of meeting their obligations as an Olympic governing body."" But the federation's immediate fate, and the fate of the investigative phase of the lawsuits, is now in the hands of a judge."
News,2018-12-06,"CHEMNITZ, Germany — Two weeks after announcing that she would not seek another term, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was standing in an old locomotive factory in the eastern city of Chemnitz, the scene of far-right protests this year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/world/europe/merkel-legacy-germany.html,2456," CHEMNITZ, Germany — Two weeks after announcing that she would not seek another term, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was standing in an old locomotive factory in the eastern city of Chemnitz, the scene of far-right protests this year. Outside, 2,500 protesters shouted: ""Merkel must go!"" Inside, 120 people — more polite but scarcely less hostile — had come to challenge the chancellor on her legacy, which on this November afternoon was mostly reduced to one thing: her 2015 decision to welcome more than a million migrants into Germany. ""You said we would manage,"" one man said, quoting Ms. Merkel's now famous mantra back at her. ""But we're not managing."" As Ms. Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Party gathers this week to choose her successor as party leader — and the likely future chancellor of Germany — the values she embodied through 13 years in power are in danger. Some now ask whether her leadership, in particular on migration and economic austerity, helped plant the seeds of the forces now tearing Europe apart. Ms. Merkel has pledged to finish out her term, which ends in 2021. But even if she defies the political obituary writers, the time in between is likely to be less than a victory lap for a chancellor who has been the face of stability in Germany and Europe, for better or worse. ""I know my face is polarizing,"" Ms. Merkel conceded in Chemnitz. That is true in Athens, Budapest and Rome as well. Ms. Merkel has been both chancellor of Germany and the leader of Europe. She steered her country and the continent through successive crises as she helped Germany become Europe's leading power for the first time since two world wars. No one has shaped the Europe of today more than this vicar's daughter from the former Communist East who was celebrated as the guardian of the liberal Western order. Ms. Merkel allowed Germans to be proud again, but on her watch the old demons of nationalism stirred back to life, too. The European Union she fought so hard to preserve is assailed by populist leaders. Those contradictions rest at the core of the Merkel legacy. As German chancellor, Ms. Merkel oversaw a golden decade for Europe's largest economy, which expanded by more than a fifth, pushing unemployment to the lowest levels since the early 1980s. As the United States was distracted by multiple wars, Britain gambled its future on a referendum to leave the European Union and France failed to reform itself, Ms. Merkel's Germany was mostly a haven of stability. But her decision to embrace more than a million asylum seekers unsettled that cozy status quo. Outside Germany, the austerity she and her longtime finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble imposed on debtor countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal and, especially, Greece sowed misery and resentment that fester to this day. Some, like the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, compare Ms. Merkel's austerity politics to the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed punitive economic measures on Germany after World War I, humiliated the country and fanned the flames of populism. ""This is now what is feeding the political beasts,"" Mr. Varoufakis said. Many of her postwar predecessors had strongly defined legacies. Konrad Adenauer anchored Germany in the West. Willy Brandt reached across the Iron Curtain. Helmut Kohl, her onetime mentor, became synonymous with German unity. Gerhard Schröder paved the way for Germany's economic success. Ms. Merkel's legacy is more fragile. She gave power a female face, and some say she softened politics and made it easier for her country to resume its historic dominance in Europe. She was careful never to boast about what had been regained. But she also failed to instill in her people a sense of responsibility and solidarity for fellow Europeans. Her modest and moderate governance style, absent ideology and vanity, is the polar opposite of that of the strongmen now strutting the world stage. Her Germany — that ""vulnerable hegemon,"" as the intellectual Herfried Münkler calls it — became a beacon of liberalism. But like her friend and ally President Barack Obama — America's first black president, who was succeeded by President Trump — Ms. Merkel will be judged by what comes next. ""Angela Merkel personifies the best Germany we've ever known,"" said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European Studies at Oxford University. ""She managed Germany's rise to once again become Europe's leading power. But she failed to prepare Germans sufficiently for what that means."" On a sunny afternoon in June 2006, Ms. Merkel was standing at the window of the chancellery in Berlin, waving to the crowd of soccer fans below who were making their way to a gigantic outdoor screen. An avid soccer fan herself, she had been chancellor for only seven months when Germany hosted the men's soccer World Cup — and when, across the country, German flags began fluttering proudly from car mirrors and apartment windows. The German team came third that year. But the tournament soon entered folk memory as ""the summer fairy tale"" — the rebirth of a liberal German patriotism in a country where national pride had long been taboo. ""That fledgling national pride that had been kept down for so long was allowed to come out, because at the very top was someone who was incredibly sensitive,"" said Evelyn Roll, one of Ms. Merkel's biographers. Or as Ines Pohl, the editor in chief of the public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, put it: ""Angela Merkel allowed Germans to be proud again."" Ms. Merkel has never been one for rousing speeches. (""We had those kinds of speeches 70 years ago,"" Ms. Roll said. ""Her lack of talent and interest in this department was a good thing."") She never boasted that Germany got what it wanted after summit meetings (though it mostly did). But as exports and domestic demand boomed, Germany prospered and so did Ms. Merkel's popularity ratings. Some say her status as a double outsider — a woman who had grown up in the East succeeding in a world of Western, mostly male politicians — ultimately changed Germany. Gregor Gysi, a fellow Easterner and political opponent from the Left party, said that spending half her life under Communism gave her a visceral thirst for freedom — but also made her more socially conscious than other Western conservatives. Over the decade that followed, she nudged her country and her conservative party to the left: New parents obtained generous new benefits, nuclear power was abandoned and same-sex marriage became legal. ""Merkel knows a different form of social and societal equality,"" Mr. Gysi said, adding of her former center-left rivals: ""That made her so much more open to adopting ideas from the Social Democrats."" It helped that she could be an incredibly skilled, even ruthless, tactician. ""I know something about coalition politics,"" an aide to David Cameron recalled her telling Britain's then prime minister in 2010, when he entered a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. ""You'll be fine, but your junior partner will be destroyed."" Indeed, now in the third so-called grand coalition with the Social Democrats, Ms. Merkel's habit of taking inspiration from (and credit for) their ideas has left the party a shadow of itself. It has also opened her own party to challenges on its right flank, leaving room for the emergence of the nationalist Alternative for Germany, which capitalized on her decision on asylum seekers. Nine years after the 2006 World Cup, Germany's summer fairy tale had a short-lived sequel. In the summer of 2015, as hundreds of thousands of migrants were pushing into Europe, and Hungarian and Austrian officials asked for her help, Ms. Merkel obliged. Germans lined the platforms, clapping as the migrant trains rolled in. Ms. Merkel's own image as the austerity chancellor had troubled her, she told her biographer Stefan Kornelius. In the throes of the migrant crisis, she showed neighboring countries a more generous Germany. It was a moment of redemption for her nation. The French president François Mitterrand and his British counterpart Margaret Thatcher had both worried about a resurgence of ""bad Germans."" Ms. Merkel's greatest achievement, Ms. Roll said, was that ""she came to represent the good Germans."" Her 2015 decision won her admiration from far beyond her own political camp. ""In this world where more and more walls are being built, literally, she did the right thing,"" said Claudia Roth, vice president of the German parliament and a member of the Greens. ''She had principles."" ""It won Germany incredible respect — this image of a friendly humanitarian Germany, a Germany that protects,"" Ms. Roth said. ""She marked that image."" But it was not long before cracks started appearing at home. Alternative for Germany, founded in 2013 as a euroskeptic party at the height of the euro crisis, got its second wind in 2015 with the arrival of the migrants. Three years later, the party is the third largest in the federal parliament and sits in all regional parliaments, too. ""German populism is perhaps not her child,"" said Henrik Enderlein, the dean of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. ""But it is a child of the Merkel era."" Ms. Merkel's decision on migration was the most defining moment of her chancellorship. It softened her image. But in her immediate neighborhood, coming deep in a lost economic decade, it did not quite have the healing effect she intended. To some, it cemented her reputation as dictating terms to the rest of a reluctant Europe, particularly in a south that had borne the brunt of the continent's dual economic and migration crises. In 2012, the first time it appeared that Greece might have to leave the currency union, caricatures of Ms. Merkel began circulating in the country: Ms. Merkel with a Hitler mustache. Ms. Merkel as a domina, her leather boot on southern Europe. Ms. Merkel as a puppet of Mr. Schäuble, the mastermind of the austerity doctrine. Even before the migration crisis arrived, the debt crisis provided a pivotal test for a chancellor at the helm of a newly dominant Germany. And it led to criticism that Ms. Merkel, while leading humbly, was no less the hegemon — prioritizing German interests; manipulating European Union institutions to Germany's abiding benefit; turning southern countries into captive export markets; tightening the hold of German banks. Was hers a European Germany, one that saw Europe's interests as its own? Or a Germany that ultimately wanted a German Europe? Many economists, and even Mr. Obama, called for looser policies, but Ms. Merkel held firm. The debate still rages over whether greater flexibility would have restored growth faster, as her critics contend, or whether fiscal restraint was needed to safeguard the euro currency, as Ms. Merkel and her supporters argued. The real missed opportunity, observers say, was to use the crisis to propel a more far-reaching build-out of European Union institutions, which remain unprepared for the next financial meltdown. If there was ever a time to make a bold push to complete the institutions of the eurozone, this was it, said Joschka Fischer, a former German foreign minister. ""An Adenauer or a Kohl would have done it,"" Mr. Fischer said. But Merkel, who had grown up behind the Iron Curtain and without the Western pro-European mind-set, ""wasn't there yet,"" he said. ""Her European conscience was not fully formed yet."" The absence of vision at that time is ""the biggest minus on her record,"" said Mr. Garton Ash, of Oxford. But if Ms. Merkel's upbringing meant that her European consciousness took longer to form, it perhaps made her bolder in other areas, like standing up to Russia and Mr. Trump, as well as her decision not to close Germany's borders to migrants. ""Of course you can build walls,'' said Gerald Knaus, the founding chairman of the European Stability Initiative, who has advised Ms. Merkel on migration for over a decade. ""But she always made clear: 'I don't build deadly walls,' "" he recalled her saying. ""She grew up behind one."" One early verdict on Ms. Merkel's legacy will be pronounced on Friday, when delegates of her Christian Democrats gather at a party congress in Hamburg and vote for a new party leader. A vote for Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the party's general secretary, known as A.K.K., would be an endorsement of the chancellor's quietly centrist course. It would also be a strong signal for women at a time when strongmen politics are gaining momentum in Europe and beyond. ""If A.K.K. succeeds Merkel, it would be her masterpiece — another woman, confident, unpretentious, who continues her liberal course,"" Mr. Knaus said. A vote for Friedrich Merz, a former Merkel rival and millionaire with a visceral sense of self-confidence, would suggest that in Germany, too, the yearning for more charismatic — and male — leadership has won the day. Mr. Merz once voted against criminalizing rape in marriage. In Germany, too, politics has become noisier and nastier. Open sexism has entered the chamber with Alternative for Germany, said Ms. Roth, the vice president of the parliament. ""Merkel has been the target of countless attacks, gendered attacks, sexualized dirt,"" Ms. Roth said. ""She is the enemy, and the way she has been personally attacked as a woman is awful,"" she said. ""That would not happen to a white man. And still, she remains upright, chin raised, and keeps working."" Some have begun to referring to Merkelism, a modest but steadfast liberalism built on consensus rather than confrontation, as a recipe for democratic governance in the 21st century. Others fear that Merkelism will disappear with her. ""She is so unvain that she does not overly care about leaving behind a blueprint for the West 4.0,"" said Mr. Kornelius, her biographer. ""She primarily wants to preserve what she can."" She has prevented crises rather than carried out visions, Mr. Kornelius said, and has been reactive rather than proactive. ""But that is incredibly valuable at a time when we are dealing with questions of our liberal order in an unraveling world — and with leaders like Donald Trump."" To her fans she is a reminder of a time when liberal democracy was expanding across the world. Today, Ms. Merkel's Germany can feel like a liberal island in a growing sea of illiberal forces. She has not changed — the world around her has. ""She is already an exception today,"" Mr. Knaus said. ""I hope she is not a relic of an era that is coming to an end."" Even some of her fiercest enemies look with trepidation to a future without her. ""She was a catastrophe,"" said Mr. Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, ""and she will be missed, because who comes next will certainly be worse."""
News,2018-12-06,"It is one of China’s proudest corporate success stories, a colossus in cutting-edge technology that elbowed out Western rivals to become the biggest supplier of the hardware that connects our modern world.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/technology/huawei-arrest-meng-wanzhou.html,1086," It is one of China's proudest corporate success stories, a colossus in cutting-edge technology that elbowed out Western rivals to become the biggest supplier of the hardware that connects our modern world. Now, all around the globe, the walls are going up for Huawei. The United States, which for years has considered the Chinese telecommunications giant a security threat, aimed a straight shot at the company's leadership when it secured the arrest, in Canada, of Huawei's chief financial officer. But lately, Huawei's setbacks have come on multiple fronts, from New Zealand and Australia to Britain and Canada. China sees the company as a pivotal driver of its ambitions for global technological leadership. Increasingly, much of the rest of the world sees it as a potential conduit for espionage and sabotage. [Stock markets were shaken by the arrest, as investors feared the impact on U.S.-China trade relations.] Huawei said Thursday that it was not aware of any wrongdoing by its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is a daughter of the company's founder, and that it complied with the law wherever it operated. The company has long denied that it spies on behalf of Beijing. For many years, the fog of distrust surrounding Huawei was a problem largely confined to the United States. Large American mobile carriers such as AT&T have avoided using Huawei's equipment in their networks ever since a 2012 congressional report highlighted the security risks. In response, Huawei focused its business efforts elsewhere. Its success in wealthy places such as Europe has helped it become the planet's largest maker of telecommunications equipment, as well as its No. 2 smartphone brand. Of the more than $90 billion in revenue it earned last year, more than a quarter came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Now, a wider patch of the world appears to be siding with Washington against Chinese technology. A turn en masse against the company, led by governments in many of its most important markets, would have grave implications for its business. Australia barred Huawei this year from supplying technology for the country's fifth-generation, or 5G, mobile networks. New Zealand last week blocked one of its leading mobile carriers from buying Huawei's 5G gear. Britain's intelligence chief, in a rare public appearance this week, said that the country had a difficult decision to make on whether to allow Huawei to build its 5G infrastructure. And Canada's top spy echoed those concerns, without naming Huawei or China, in a speech on Tuesday. Huawei has tested 5G equipment with major mobile carriers in both Canada and Britain. Behind the tariff fight that has engulfed Washington and Beijing lies a deeper contest for leadership in future technologies such as supercomputing, artificial intelligence and 5G mobile internet. For many people in China, the contest feels not merely commercial, but civilizational. At stake is the country's ability to claim its rightful place as a superpower. ""The Chinese government and Chinese companies must face these new circumstances, take up new countermeasures and get through this stage of crisis,"" Fang Xingdong, the founder of ChinaLabs, a technology think tank in Beijing, said on Thursday. ""This is a necessary rite of passage for China's global technological rise."" Huawei has tried to avoid being pulled into this fight. In an internal memo from January that was reviewed by The New York Times, Ren Zhengfei, the company's founder, outlined a strategy for navigating these uncertain times. The key, he wrote: Keep adapting. But do so quietly. ""Sometimes, it's better to find a safe place and wait for stormy weather to pass,"" Mr. Ren wrote. Europe was one such place, Mr. Ren said. Huawei has cultivated political friendships and invested heavily in places like Britain. ""Eventually, through years of effort, our goal is for Europeans to perceive Huawei as a European company,"" Mr. Ren wrote. Canada seemed to be another safe harbor. ""The Canadian government is very sensible and open, giving us enormous confidence in our investments in this country,"" Mr. Ren wrote. This was all before Washington nearly put out of business Huawei's main Chinese rival, ZTE. In April, the Commerce Department barred ZTE from using components made in the United States after saying the company had failed to punish employees who violated American sanctions against Iran and North Korea. The move was effectively a death sentence because ZTE relied heavily on American microchips and other technology. In building its case against ZTE, the United States government began investigating Huawei as well. When the Commerce Department first announced its findings against ZTE in 2016, it released an internal ZTE document illustrating best practices for evading American sanctions. In describing the approach, the document cited a company it nicknamed F7 as a model for how to pull it off. The description of F7 in the document matched Huawei. A few months later, the Commerce Department subpoenaed Huawei and requested all information about its export or re-export of American technology to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, according to a copy of the subpoena seen by The Times. The inquiry widened this year when the Treasury and Commerce Departments asked the Justice Department to investigate Huawei for possible sanctions violations. Prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York took on the case. Eventually, the Trump administration decided to ease its punishment of ZTE, in an effort to cool tensions with China's leader, Xi Jinping, ahead of a historic North Korea meeting. But the power that Washington wielded over the fates of Chinese tech companies had been made very clear to people on both sides of the Pacific. In October, the Commerce Department imposed export controls on Fujian Jinhua, a state-backed semiconductor company that has been accused of stealing American chip designs. Should Huawei be subjected to a ban on using American technology, the consequences would be significant, though perhaps not as life-threatening as they were for ZTE. One crucial difference is that Huawei, unlike ZTE, does not depend extensively on outside vendors such as Qualcomm for the main chips in its smartphones. Around two-thirds of the handsets that Huawei sells contain chips made in-house, said Sean Kao, a hardware analyst at the research firm IDC. Still, American firms supply other kinds of chips in Huawei's gear as well as optical equipment for its fiber cable networks and other specialized parts. ""I don't know exactly how many suppliers are affected,"" said Stéphane Téral, senior research director at the data provider IHS Markit. But one thing is certain, he said: ""They won't be easily substitutable."""
News,2018-12-06,"Turning Point: Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm, harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network alerting users.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/opinion/maggie-shen-king-the-big-phish.html,1183," Turning Point: Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm, harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network alerting users. We have long ago come to terms with the trade-off that to participate in social media, we must first give up our privacy. We sacrifice vital parts of our personal data so that we may amplify our voice, stroke our ego and connect with a virtual tribe. Turning Points asked the writer Maggie Shen King to explore a data-driven dystopia, and she responded with a piece of flash fiction. Sofie could not understand why the bidding stopped a week ago. Her database of 87 million Facebook records was the weapon of the century. Its cache of personal information made spear phishing child's play. A pre-emptive bid should have ended her auction before it even began. She checked her countdown clock — 5 minutes 39 seconds. Auctions were, of course, all about the last seconds. She hadn't a doubt she'd lured all the right players to her party, so why was the bid stuck at half of where it should be? Her stomach would not stop churning. She pinched her wrist and held her breath. These records were hers. She was the one smart enough to grab them before Cambridge Analytica blew up and kicked her to the curb. What she was doing was no different than what her employer had done to Facebook and what Facebook had done to their users. And had those users not valued the serendipitous reconnections with high school boyfriends, the ego strokes from bragging about their expensive vacations and their little child prodigies and a public forum in which to harangue their elected officials, they would not have put their private information out there. Facebook users understood that they had to give away a part of themselves for easy connections and the much-coveted limelight. Sofie tore off a hangnail with her teeth. She had become her father. She'd thumbed her nose at his poker dens and bookie operation, signed her name to a boatload of student loans and declared independence. But after Cambridge Analytica gave her the boot without so much as a kind word or her last paycheck, she finally understood that money bought self-respect. Without self-respect, she was nothing. She returned to her auction site on the dark web. Still no action. Her reserve price had surfaced the four whales. Would she be showing weakness or, worse, desperation sending them a reminder? No, she was in charge, and she would demonstrate that with a final prod, a do-it-or-lose-forever stick-in-the-eye. Above all else, her bidders could not abide losing. Nor could they afford to. She began with Saeed, her Iranian contact. Micro-targeted spear phishing would be much more potent than the SQL injection and DDoS attacks they had used to cripple American banking websites. Her database would provide a rash of entry points for their malware to take down Saudi oil fields. Salâam alaikum. Our auction ends in 4 minutes. Just between us, the Chinese are coming in with a billion at the close. I'd rather you win AND stick it to the American infidels by paying me with their hostage ransom money. Are you going to let their crippling sanctions and the Israeli destruction of your priceless centrifuges go unanswered? She waited for a reply, but heard just the drumming of her own heart. She moved on to Pak, her North Korean connection. Their Reconnaissance General Bureau was at least 5,000 hackers strong and adept at brute force cyberattacks. Their email hack of Sony Pictures for the lampooning of their supreme leader had devastated the company. With Sofie's database, they could take down more financial institutions and military agencies, keep themselves on the world stage and finance their feeble economy at the same time. 정식여보세요. Billion dollar bid just came in from your neighbor. Show your rivals you are no laughingstock. Long live North Korean strength, unpredictability and wily intelligence! Her laptop pinged. She pumped her fist: Her two messages were just opened. Three minutes and counting. Sofie forged ahead and considered how best to rile Misha. He represented a coalition that included the Russian government, wealthy oligarchs and criminal gangs. Should she emphasize the financial gain possible with the pairing of her database and the massive storehouse of credit card information that their mafia had already amassed? The opportunity to disrupt Western military, electrical and banking infrastructures? The ability to misinform, divide and reshape Western opinions? She went for the highest stake. Приве́т. Auction for the weapon of the century is ending. The Chinese have sent in a kill bid. I'm obligated to take it, but hey, I make the rules. I'd prefer my database be used to change elections and blackmail hypocritical, holier-than-thou American politicians. And smarmy British toadies. And German rats. You have 90 seconds to win this. With less than 2 minutes left, she considered ignoring Lao Da. The Chinese had ticked her off with two insultingly low ""fill-or-kill"" bids and then threatened to walk away. They returned each time though, unabashed. They had more resources than all of the other bidders combined and were above spear phishing for petty gains. By combining Sofie's database with the 22 million U.S. Office of Personnel Management files in their possession, they could steal intellectual properties and military secrets at will for their industrial and state-owned operations. The Russians have come to play with a cool billion. Can you do better??? You have 30 seconds to enter your final bid. Watching her clock tick down, Sofie dug the tip of her father's lucky Montblanc — the one he reserved for his second set of books — into her thigh. She smiled picturing him tossing his apartment for it and cursing her. At 00:30, her message box began to ding. She was right. Auctions happened in the last seconds. Her body went limp with relief. $525 million final bid, $530 million, $505 million and $509 million. The bastards were colluding. Not only did they disregard her billion-dollar threat, their bids were obscenely close. Someone had unlocked the multilayer state-of-the-art security on her site and contacted their rivals. Of course they did. She was dealing with the best hackers in the world. Sofie's head pounded with rage. She should invalidate the auction and start over. The thought depressed her. It had taken her nearly a year to disguise her identity, set up her site, get the word out, vet all the players and create an airtight verification process. Moreover, portions of her data were time sensitive. By colluding, they would all get her database, so why shouldn't they each pay her price? They had invalidated the auction. A new game was in play. A corner of her lip crooked upward as Sofie crafted her message. She congratulated each player for winning the auction at their submitted bid and enclosed an OAuth token — good for 1 minute only — that would unlock the encryption keys to her database upon the transfer of funds. One way or another, she would get her billion dollars."
Op-Ed,2018-12-06,"In the eight years since it was decided, Citizens United has unleashed a wave of campaign spending that by any reasonable standard is extraordinarily corrupt.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/opinion/citizens-united-corruption-pacs.html,2490," In the eight years since it was decided, Citizens United has unleashed a wave of campaign spending that by any reasonable standard is extraordinarily corrupt. To see how this operates in practice, let's take a look at how Paul Ryan, the outgoing speaker of the House, negotiated a path — narrowly constructed to stay on the right side of the law — during a recent fund-raising trip to Las Vegas, as recounted in detail by Politico. In early May, Ryan flew to Nevada to solicit money from Sheldon Adelson — the casino magnate who was by far the largest Republican contributor of 2018 — for the Congressional Leadership Fund, an independent expenditure super PAC. Ryan was accompanied by Norm Coleman, a former Republican Senator from Minnesota. The Leadership Fund, according to its website, is ""a super PAC exclusively dedicated to protecting and strengthening the Republican Majority in the House of Representatives."" It ""operates independently of any federal candidate or officeholder."" Adelson could not legally hand over his check to Ryan, who is a federal officeholder. Incidentally, Adelson's company, Las Vegas Sands, reported a $700 million windfall as a result of the $1.5 trillion tax cut enacted last year by the House under Ryan's supervision. So how did they conduct this delicate transaction? First, Ryan, Coleman and others ""laid out a case to Adelson about how crucial it is to protect the House,"" according to Politico's report. Then Ryan ""left the room, Coleman made the 'ask' and secured the $30 million contribution."" Will behavior like this ""cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy?"" Apparently not, according to Anthony M. Kennedy, the recently retired justice who wrote Citizens United with the backing of four of his colleagues. The crucial section of Citizens United reads as follows: The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy. By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate. The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing to spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate influence over elected officials. This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the electorate will refuse ""to take part in democratic governance"" because of additional political speech made by a corporation or any other speaker. Since 2010, when the case was decided, independent expenditures and other forms of outside spending have grown exponentially, according to OpenSecrets. In 2010, independent expenditures totaled $203.9 million; in 2016, it was $1.48 billion. In this nonpresidential year, with final reports still to come, independent expenditures totaled at least $1.18 billion. The surge in outside spending unconstrained by contribution limits is a central element of current campaign finance practice. Dan Eggen, writing in the Washington Post on July 16, 2012, described the state of campaign finance reform more than 40 years after Watergate: Four decades later, there's little need for furtive fund-raising or secret handoffs of cash. Many of the corporate executives convicted of campaign-finance crimes during Watergate could now simply write a check to their favorite super PAC or, if they want to keep it secret, to a compliant nonprofit group. Corporations can spend as much as they want to help their favored candidates, no longer prohibited by law from spending company cash on elections. The political world has, in many respects, come full circle since a botched burglary funded by illicit campaign cash brought down an administration.  Detractors — primarily on the left — have criticized Citizens United and a 2013 appeals court decision based on it, Free Speech v F.E.C., for opening the door to unlimited corporate spending in politics. In fact, there are scholars on both the left and right who agree with Citizens United because they think restricting campaign spending by businesses constitutes an incursion on First Amendment rights that could lead to censorship, for example, of books and newspapers. Laurence Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School, and Joshua Matz, an attorney in private practice, write in their 2014 book Uncertain Justice: The Roberts Court and the Constitution that Allowing government to control who can spend enough to get heard on a grander scale would render freedom of speech illusory. In a 2015 law review article, however, ""Dividing 'Citizens United': The Case v. The Controversy,"" Tribe faulted Citizens United for implausibly downplaying, and at times all but denying, the baleful corruption of American politics by means short of criminal bribery — by means that are lamentable precisely because they are lawful. The key changes in campaign finance practices over the past eight years stem from the ruling in Citizens United and Speech Now that contributions to independent expenditure committees, including super PACs, pose no threat of ""quid pro quo"" political corruption. There is no corruption, Justice Kennedy wrote in Citizens United, because ""an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate."" Roll Call, in a story headlined ""Firewall Between Candidates and Super PACs Breaking Down"" described the myth of non-coordination: The supposed barrier between candidates and unrestricted super PACs is flimsier than ever. As midterm elections approach, complaints are rolling into the F.E.C. from both parties about super PACs that share vendors, fund-raisers and video footage with the politicians they support. Along the same lines, a 2015 note in the Harvard Law Review concluded: Candidate assistance with super PAC fund-raising efforts has pushed at the boundaries of this legally mandated independence, allowing a level of coordination that many observers believe creates a real threat of quid pro quo corruption. The detrimental role super PACs play in campaigns prompted Albert W. Alschuler, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, and three colleagues — including Tribe — to argue in a 2017 working paper that the negative attack ads spawned by super PACS are in themselves corrosive and provide adequate grounds to ban such PACs and the unlimited contributions that fund them: Although these groups may not coordinate their expenditures with those of an official campaign, their managers often understand that their job is to attack an opponent while the candidate they support takes a higher road. Super PACs have been called ""the attack dogs and provocateurs of modern politics."" The advertisements they produce contribute to the nation's cynicism about politics, a cynicism that runs especially deep among young people. The candidates they support need not take responsibility for what they say, and the groups usually disappear once an election is over. A strong critic of the Supreme Court decision, Sanford Levinson, a member of the law school faculty and the department of government at the University of Texas, argued in an email to me that: Citizens United reveals the importance of having a Supreme Court completely devoid of a single individual who has ever participated in electoral politics. This helps to reinforce, I believe, the tendency of the Justices to think in terms of arid formalistic abstractions — including Kennedy's views about corporations and the First Amendment — rather than address the actual realities of our political system. Robert C. Post, a professor at Yale Law School, also views Justice Kennedy's views as exceptionally shortsighted, declaring in a 2013 lecture that It is the height of hubris for the Court, by a vote of five justices on a bench of nine, simply to dismiss concerns for electoral integrity on the ground that electoral integrity is a question of law rather than of social fact. Fred Wertheimer — the president of Democracy 21, who has ""participated as a lawyer in every major Supreme Court case starting with Buckley v Valeo,"" a key 1976 post-Watergate campaign finance decision — took this argument a step further. He wrote me: The Roberts majority on the Supreme Court has consistently failed to have a clue about the consequences of its campaign finance decisions and the ways in which their decisions in Citizens United and McCutcheon opened the door to the return of the corrupting contributions that led to the Watergate campaign finance scandals in the 1970s and the 'soft money' campaign finance scandals of the 1990s. In McCutcheon, the court ruled that aggregate limits on the total amount an individual could give to federal candidates in every two year cycle — $123,200 in 2013-14 — were unconstitutional. In one section of a detailed critique he sent me, Wertheimer wrote: The Court in Citizens United stated, ""Limits on independent expenditures, such as (the ban on corporate expenditures) have a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government's interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption. The anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question."" This is a remarkably misguided statement in that the Court is asserting that the foundational need of our nation to be able to protect itself from the corruption of our government is outweighed by the constitutional right of a corporation to make unlimited expenditures to influence elections. The court, Wertheimer continued, was ""misguided and naïve"" in making the assertion in Citizens United without citing a single piece of evidence for this finding that ""the appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in this democracy."" In the face of all this criticism, does Justice Kennedy, the now-retired author of Citizens United, have any second thoughts? Rick Hasen, a campaign finance expert at the University of California-Irvine's law school, told me that as recently as last week, Kennedy expressed no regrets. When Kennedy was asked in an interview at the University of Virginia, Hasen wrote, ""if, in the wake of the huge influx of money into elections, he had any regrets about his majority opinion in Citizens United v. FEC, he said the decision 'stands for itself'. "" Bob Bauer, a Democratic campaign finance lawyer who is now a law professor at N.Y.U., wrote me that the Supreme Court's intervention in the political process has been defined by a lack of prescience or success. What the majority in Citizens United had to say about corporate independent expenditures and the risk of corruption seemed entirely divorced from reality. The court has created a world in which both the parties and candidates can indirectly but effectively raise and benefit from unlimited donations purportedly expended on an ""independent basis."" Justice Kennedy, Bauer continued, put considerable faith in disclosure requirements as the antidote to any potential problems of corruption — and then had to concede later that he was surprised that disclosure is ""not working the way it should."" It was fairly predictable that it wouldn't. Post contended that in many respects Citizens United is a failed attempt to address a problem created by Buckley v. Valeo. In his 2013 Tanner lecture, Post made the following argument: Because Buckley prohibited the state from regulating independent expenditures while allowing it to regulate contributions, it ""produced a system in which candidates face an unlimited demand for campaign funds (because expenditures generally cannot be capped) but a constricted supply (because there is often a ceiling on the amount each contributor can give) … The result is an unceasing preoccupation with fund-raising."" (Post was quoting from ""The Hydraulics of Campaign Finance Reform"" by Samuel Issacharoff and Pamela S. Karlan.) Citizens United has turned campaign finance into a system universally disdained by the public, a system even more ethically unmoored than the one obtained before Watergate in the days when, to quote Eggen again: The money poured into Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign from all corners: Six-figure checks flown by corporate jet from Texas; bundles of payments handed over at an Illinois game preserve; a battered brown attaché case stuffed with $200,000 in cash from a New Jersey investor hoping to fend off a fraud investigation. The difference now is that the checks are bigger. How did this come about? Essentially, by legal fiat: a declaration by five Supreme Court justices that what looks, smells and feels like corruption is not in fact corruption. Tribe has summed up the decision succinctly: The Supreme Court's sin in Citizens United is not that it has been wrong to recognize and embrace the libertarian values that inhere in the First Amendment. But the libertarian campaign finance law the Court has developed fails in the broader project vital to First Amendment jurisprudence: the sensitive accommodation of competing constitutional values. The Court has not only underemphasized the egalitarian strain in First Amendment law — it has rejected that strain outright. And it has failed to recognize the range of plainly legitimate conceptions of democracy that Americans hold, instead privileging one view, democracy-by-financial-contributions, above all others. The likelihood that the current conservative majority would take into account the ""egalitarian strain in First Amendment law,"" as described by Tribe, is zero. In Citizens United, the court pointedly overturned a 1990 ruling, Austin v Michigan Chamber of Commerce. In doing so, the court explicitly rejected the finding in Austin that regulation of corporate political spending is justified as a legitimate means of remedying the inequity that grows out of the fact that state-created advantages not only allow corporations to play a dominant role in the Nation's economy, but also permit them to use ""resources amassed in the economic marketplace"" to obtain ""an unfair advantage in the political marketplace."" The American system of campaign finance, undergirded by a Supreme Court whose conservative members feign innocence, has become the enabler of corrosive processes of economic and political inequality. Surely the justices are not benighted enough to believe that Paul Ryan and his ilk have no idea what they are doing. In this context, Tribe writes: The Citizens United Court took the narrowest possible view of corruption, maintaining that the only legitimate government interest in this field is the prevention of quid pro quo corruption. But, as many have argued in response, quid pro quo corruption is far too narrow a governmental interest to identify as constitutionally relevant. It is an interest that does not begin to reflect the full stakes at issue in the campaign finance realm: the health of American democracy itself. Unless the notion of interests sufficiently compelling to count in the First Amendment calculus is strangely truncated to exclude interests this fundamental simply because they appear imprecise or diffuse, courts must recognize a compelling interest in combating corruption broadly defined as a distortion in the political process, understood to include a deviation from the ideal of equal representation embodied in Federalist 57. Tribe's view is shared by Martin Gilens, a political scientist at Princeton, who wrote in ""Affluence and Influence: Economic Inequality and Political Power in America"": As resources flow toward the already most advantaged Americans, their ability to use those resources to shape policy increases. Of course rich Americans hold diverse preferences, just as the poor and the middle class. But despite some prominent liberal counterexamples, rich Americans tend to support the economic policies from which they have so greatly benefited. This raises the disturbing prospect of a vicious cycle in which growing economic and political inequality are mutually reinforcing. We are seeing that vicious cycle in operation today, with a Supreme Court incapable of applying either reason or common sense to stop the madness. I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.

News,2018-12-06,"A steep slide followed by a strong recovery whipsawed investors on Thursday, as concerns about the global economy, trade tensions and interest rates kept markets on edge.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/business/stocks-wall-street-huawei-trade.html,838," A steep slide followed by a strong recovery whipsawed investors on Thursday, as concerns about the global economy, trade tensions and interest rates kept markets on edge. Stocks fell around the world after the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive intensified concerns that China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, could be entering a risky new chapter in their trade dispute. But Wall Street recovered most of those losses in an afternoon rally predicated on the prospect that the Federal Reserve may slow down on interest rate increases next year. At one point in the day, the S&P 500 was down as much as 2.9 percent, mirroring steep declines in Asia and Europe. A recovery late in the trading day, however, left the index down only about 0.2 percent at the closing bell. The dueling messages continued on Friday morning in Asia, where markets were mixed and futures that predict Wall Street's opening showed a modest drop. The worldwide drop was set off by news that the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, had been arrested in Canada at the request of the United States. Her detention on Saturday, the same day President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to a trade truce, could further complicate efforts to resolve a dispute that has weighed on financial markets in recent weeks. In recent days, skepticism had already grown about prospects for that 90-day truce, as Trump administration aides played down the chances of striking a broad deal and Mr. Trump threatened further tariffs on imports from China, even calling himself a ""Tariff Man"" in messages on Twitter. But the arrest of Ms. Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, threatened to open a riskier new chapter in a fight that investors increasingly see as a threat to financial markets and the economy. ""This is going to continue to be a headwind at a time when people are worried about global growth,"" said Dan Clifton, a head of policy research with the analysis firm Strategas. For most of the year, the United States — less reliant on trade than most wealthy nations — had been a global standout, thanks in part to a burst of fiscal stimulus from the Trump tax cuts, while the trade war caused trouble in the rest of the world's financial markets. In China, where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in almost a decade, stocks have slumped more than 20 percent. Export-based economies that are closely tied to China — like Japan and Germany — have started to struggle too. Growth in emerging markets, which often supply the commodities that have fueled the Chinese boom in recent decades, has also been hurt. But in recent weeks, worry about the trade war has begun to take hold in the United States as well. Since its peak in late September, the S&P 500 has declined by 8 percent, as investors grew concerned about the outlook for corporate profits, the potential costs of the trade spat and rising interest rates, which are traditionally viewed as a negative for stocks. The outlook for interest rates shifted suddenly on Thursday, when The Wall Street Journal published an article saying Federal Reserve officials were considering emphasizing a ""wait-and-see"" approach to future rate increases at the central bank's meeting later this month. Although this message was in line with previous Fed comments, the stock market began to recover soon after the article was published. The rally did little for investors in energy shares. The sector has been hard hit by a slump in crude oil prices in recent weeks and was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500 on Thursday. Prices for benchmark American crude oil fell more than 2 percent on Thursday, as OPEC ended its meeting on Thursday without reaching a deal to reduce oil output, even as Saudi Arabia pressed for production cuts. Exxon Mobil and Chevron both dropped more than 1 percent. Elsewhere, yields on government bonds dropped sharply early in the day as investors flocked to the safety of Treasury debt. But the declines in yields moderated late in the day, in tandem with the shift in stock trading. Bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, tend to drop as investors downgrade expectations for growth and inflation. Those lower yields can crimp the profitability of banks, which charge interest rates that are based on government bond yields. The threat of such pressures has hammered American financial stocks in recent days. The S&P 500 financial sector index was the second-worst-performing part of the market on Thursday, dropping 1.4 percent. And while few expect a hasty end to the economic expansion in the United States, the recent swings in stocks suggest investors are increasingly worrying about any threats that could worsen growth forecasts. ""There's a bit of a growth slowdown in place,"" said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock. ""This is a very different environment from where we were this time last year."""
News,2018-12-06,Good Thursday. Want this by email? Sign up here.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/business/dealbook/facebook-email-data.html,1932," Good Thursday. Want this by email? Sign up here. A cache of emails and other internal Facebook documents made public by a British parliamentary committee on Wednesday revealed how the social media giant used people's personal data to favor some of its partners and to punish rivals. The 250 pages of material, from 2012 to 2015, had been sealed by a U.S. judge as part of a lawsuit filed against Facebook by an app developer, but they were obtained by British lawmakers as part of a parliamentary investigation into the company's practices. Some highlights: Facebook engineered ways to collect data without telling users. In one exchange, employees discussed a possible app update that would log users' phone calls. ""This is a pretty high risk thing to do from a P.R. perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it,"" Michael LeBeau, an employee, said in one email. Mark Zuckerberg approved cutting off a competitor's data access. In 2013, after Twitter released the video app Vine, Facebook ended Twitter's access to friends data. ""Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today,"" Justin Osofsky, a Facebook executive, said in an email at the time. The response from Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive: ""Yup, go for it."" Data was prized above almost everything else. ""Sometimes the best way to enable people to share something is to have a developer build a special purpose app or network for that type of content and to make that app social by having Facebook plug into it,"" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a 2012 email. ""That may be good for the world, but it's not good for us unless people also share back to Facebook and that content increases the value of our network."" Facebook said the documents had been cherry-picked to show the company in an unfavorable light. ""Like any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform,"" the company said. ""But the facts are clear: We've never sold people's data."" More Facebook news: The company's board said it was ""entirely appropriate"" for Sheryl Sandberg to investigate whether George Soros had shorted the company's stock. And internal tensions at the social network are reportedly becoming far more intense. Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese tech giant Huawei and the daughter of the company's founder, was arrested in Canada on Saturday at the request of the U.S. Context: The U.S. government, which views Huawei as a national security threat, has taken steps to restrict the use of the company's technology and has been lobbying other countries to do the same. Just this week, a major British telecommunications company announced it would strip Huawei hardware from its core 4G network. Why it matters: Given that Huawei is one of China's corporate jewels, Ms. Meng's detention would most likely increase tensions between Beijing and Washington as they start new trade negotiations. What happens next in this high-stakes game? ""The U.S. Department of Justice and the Trump administration have an important question to answer,"" Tim Culpan of Bloomberg Opinion writes. ""What do we want out of this?"" The wrong decision could escalate the trade war at a time both nations are hoping for peace. A travel note for U.S. executives: ""They will retaliate and China will take hostages,"" James Lewis, director of technology policy at the think tank CSIS told Axios. ""If I was an American tech executive, I wouldn't travel to China this week."" President Trump said yesterday that the Chinese government was sending ""very strong signals"" about what might emerge from the trade truce he and President Xi Jinping reached last weekend in Buenos Aires. The comment was apparently a reference to remarks of Beijing being ""confident"" a comprehensive deal can be reached before a tariff freeze expires in 90 days. Plenty of people are unconvinced. More from Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley of the NYT: • ""Mr. Trump and his advisers have been touting the trade truce reached in Buenos Aires as a victory, saying that China had agreed to buy $1.2 trillion worth of American products."" • ""But trade experts and industry insiders remain perplexed, anxiously awaiting information about the timing and composition of the $1.2 trillion, a number that dwarfs the $130 billion in goods that the United States exported to China last year."" • ""If China doubled the amount of goods it bought from the United States starting next year, it would take nearly a decade to reach the $1.2 trillion goal."" OPEC officials are meeting in Vienna today, and it's a tricky time for the oil industry, writes Stanley Reed of the NYT. Why it matters: Oil prices have swung wildly in recent months, with crude tumbling 35 percent to less than $50 a barrel before rebounding slightly this week. The industry would like to lift prices by restricting production, but Mr. Trump has been explicit about wanting to keep prices low. What to expect: ""Most analysts say that the oil producers have little choice but to announce a substantial cut in production of at least one million barrels a day, or around 1 percent of world oil supplies,"" Mr. Reed writes. ""Otherwise, prices could slide into the $40-a-barrel range or lower, squeezing the oil-dependent economies of member countries."" What can go wrong: The future of Russian oil production and the amount of Iranian oil that U.S. sanctions will take off the market could still sway prices. There's a huge business opportunity in climate change. Exploiting it is the hard part. In a climate change report published yesterday, scientists likened the quickening growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions to a ""speeding freight train,"" and warned that the world may face some of global warming's most severe consequences sooner than expected. Greg Ip of the WSJ outlines what that means for businesses: ""Worries don't translate into solutions unless businesses devise products that emit dramatically less planet-warming greenhouse gases. The innovation is the easy part; getting people to buy it is the hard part. That requires incentives, which depend heavily on governments. Without their intervention, solar and wind power, and electric and hybrid cars would have no foothold against their fossil fuel competitors."" But he also notes that many government interventions aren't sufficiently informed by long-term thinking. Tom Linebarger, the chief executive of the engine maker Cummins, tells Mr. Ip that there's an obvious path forward. ""If we want rules that are more effective, decide the end result we want and let technology compete for the best solution,"" he said. ""Carbon taxes are much better than all the other choices."" The U.S. markets were closed yesterday in honor of former President George Bush. When they reopen today, there could be bad news. Global markets have slumped. After dropping yesterday, they did so again today. The Nikkei in Japan fell about 2 percent, and the pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell over 2 percent in morning trading. Futures tracking U.S. stocks aren't encouraging. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow all appear set to open with losses of more than 1.5 percent today. What's driving the malaise? Trade concerns are playing a big role, and the arrest of Meng Wanzhou of Huawei added to unease about the prospects for the U.S.-China trade truce. The flattening yield curve, which is seen as an early indicator of a looming recession, is also having an impact. Add to that more general fears of a slowing global economy, Brexit and a troubled tech sector. A new study by UBS suggests worldwide unemployment was 5.2 percent in September. That's down from 8 percent in 2010, and the lowest level since 1980. More on the numbers from the FT: Arend Kapteyn, UBS chief economist, said that greater labor market flexibility since the financial crisis — due to factors such as lower wages and the advent of the gig economy — had helped lower the natural rate of unemployment in many countries. The change has been particularly pronounced in Eastern Europe: Polish unemployment has fallen to 6.2 percent from 20 percent in 2002, for instance, and Croatia and Slovakia have similar stories. But unemployment has dropped in many of the largest economies too, including the U.S., Britain, Germany and Japan. Robert Dickey, C.E.O. of the newspaper publisher Gannett, plans to retire by May. Martin Anstice, C.E.O. of Lam Research, has resigned amid allegations of misconduct in the workplace.

News,2018-12-06,"LONDON — The British government is preparing to suspend a special visa program that allows wealthy investors to fast-track their settlement in the country, part of a new drive to crack down on money laundering.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/world/europe/uk-golden-visa-suspended.html,696," LONDON — The British government is preparing to suspend a special visa program that allows wealthy investors to fast-track their settlement in the country, part of a new drive to crack down on money laundering. The Tier 1 visas will be suspended from midnight on Dec. 7 until the Home Office introduces tighter restrictions to tackle corruption and organized crime. ""We will not tolerate people who do not play by the rules and seek to abuse the system,"" Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said in a statement on Thursday. They are not called ""golden visas"" for nothing. They provide a faster route for wealthy investors coming from outside the European Union and Switzerland to settle in Britain. The program was introduced in 2008 to attract wealthy foreign nationals willing to invest large amounts of capital in Britain. Billions of pounds have poured into London over the past decade, following an influx of global elites who have benefited from the program. It peaked in 2014, after 1,172 visas were granted. The visa program has been especially popular among Russian oligarchs and wealthy people from China and the United Arab Emirates. More than 1,000 investment visas were granted in the 12-month period ending in September 2018. To qualify, foreign nationals must put down a minimum of 2 million pounds (around $2.5 million) as an investment in Britain. Such an investment in United Kingdom bonds, share capital or companies allows investors to apply for permanent residency within five years. For a £5 million investment, they can apply for permanent residency after three years. An investment of £10 million can open the door to permanent residency after two years. After that, the nationals theoretically could apply for citizenship. The visa program has always had its critics, with anticorruption campaigners railing against Britain's openness to ill-gotten riches from overseas and the foreigners who invest them. But it reached a fever pitch after a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, was poisoned on British soil with a nerve agent in Salisbury, England. Prime Minister Theresa May's government signaled then that it would review the cases of 700 Russians who were granted visas to live in Britain under the Tier 1 visa scheme. Soon afterward, the visa renewal for the Russian billionaire owner of the Chelsea football team, Roman Abramovich, was mysteriously delayed. Mr. Abramovich later surfaced in Israel, where he had apparently immigrated under the law of return, which guarantees citizenship to any Jew wanting to move there. Criticism of the program can be traced as far back as 2014, after visa applications soared. The government's Migration Advisory Committee filed a report that said the scheme brought limited economic benefits because most of the investors had bought fixed-interest loan securities known as gilts, meaning that they were effectively loaning the government money instead of investing in the country. ""We do not need such investment to fund the deficit. We are selling around £300 million of gilts every day — therefore the capital market is working very efficiently,"" the report said. While investors and their families spend money in Britain and generate revenue, the favorable impacts are typically exaggerated, the committee found. As the benefits were being questioned, the authorities grew concerned over the origins of funds being invested into the country. This year, the government introduced ""unexplained wealth orders,"" forcing those suspected of serious crimes to explain the provenance of their wealth and assets. The National Crime Agency estimated that £100 billion in ""dirty money"" was being funneled into Britain each year, mainly from Russian, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Far East. After the visa program is suspended on Friday, the Home Office will conduct an investigation before reintroducing it with stricter regulations. Under the new rules, visa applicants will have to provide audits of all their financial and business interests using firms registered in the United Kingdom, and show that they have had control of their funds for at least two years, the Home Office said. Changes will also be introduced to increase the benefits of the investment to British companies."

She thought it should be structured as a loan with a minimal interest rate. But when my parents helped with her kids' education, years ago, there was no loan. Am I being petty? I intend to speak to my parents, but I'd love your input. KATHY Here's the thing about your parents' money: It's theirs! Asking for an advance on your inheritance is crass, for sure, but worse, it may hurt their feelings — as if you were licking your chops in anticipation of their death. (And I'm sure you're not.) So, let's find another way. You don't say how well off your parents are, how much of their savings they may need in the future or whether the power of attorney is already in effect. If you are sure that they are still competent to make this decision and can afford it, ask for a loan. Let them decide whether to make it a gift. And drop the tit-for-tat with your sister over her children's education. That help was given at another time and probably long planned. My biggest reservation here is that many parents I know would go without to help their children (even deep into adulthood). If that sounds like yours, stick with your original plan to pay for the house yourself. There comes a time to put our parents first, after years of the reverse arrangement. That time may have come, Kathy. When I first began dating my girlfriend, about a year ago, I told her I would always cook for her. (I was a decent cook in college.) She was very into this idea. But every time I cook for her I get something wrong. She's never had a decent meal that came from my kitchen. And when she's not around, my meals come out beautifully! What can I do? SOPHIE Other than relax? This is called performance anxiety, Sophie, and many of us suffer from it. Give me a bucket of balls and a deserted tennis court, and I serve like Serena Williams. Put someone on the other side of the net, and I double-fault all afternoon. Try turning down the pressure on yourself. On the tennis court, I play points without keeping score. In the kitchen, enlist your girlfriend's help. A cassoulet made by two may be a less freighted enterprise for you. Once you've got a few decent meals under your belt, I imagine you'll be back to cooking as well as ever. (And a nice glass of Barolo probably wouldn't hurt.) My husband, our young son and I have a house in the country, a few hours from our primary residence. We don't get there often because of our heavy workloads. But when we do, our neighbors (who also have a young child) are at our door within 10 minutes of our arrival. The kids are happy to see each other. But my husband and I would like to settle in and enjoy some downtime together rather than immediately hear stories about our neighbors' lives since the last time we saw them. How do we maintain a friendly relationship and stop the uninvited visits? ANONYMOUS Here's a wild suggestion: the truth! Boundaries don't appear by magic; we set them. The next time your neighbors bound over, say, ""How nice to see you! Let us settle in, and maybe we can grab a drink later?""  Let the kids play. Relax with your husband. And invite the neighbors over for a glass of wine at night or coffee the next day. If you don't like them turning up uninvited, you have to let them know. Just be neighborly about it. My best friend from childhood married a dunderhead who thinks it's funny to post unflattering pictures of her on Instagram without her knowledge. The photos are often of her sleeping or wearing pajamas. He also writes posts that paint her in a poor light. Initially, he lied to her about this. (Their pastor even got involved!) But he's still posting about her regularly. I'd like to rat him out. But would that be meddling in their marriage? ANONYMOUS If your friend confided in you about this problem, it's reasonable to check in with her and let her know that the unappealing photos are still coming fast and furious. But stay out of this mess if you heard about it from a third party.  Your friend is surely aware of her husband's behavior. It doesn't require mad sleuthing skills (or a friend from youth) for her to check his social media feeds occasionally and call him out on his nasty behavior.

News,2018-12-06,"WASHINGTON — At dinner with China’s president, Xi Jinping, on Saturday night in Buenos Aires, President Trump celebrated their “special” relationship and all but predicted they would emerge with a truce in the trade war between the United States and China.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/us/politics/huawei-meng-china-iran.html,1323," WASHINGTON — At dinner with China's president, Xi Jinping, on Saturday night in Buenos Aires, President Trump celebrated their ""special"" relationship and all but predicted they would emerge with a truce in the trade war between the United States and China. Seven thousand miles away, unbeknown to both leaders, Canadian police acting at the request of the United States were in the process of detaining Meng Wanzhou, a top executive of one of China's flagship technology firms, as she changed planes in Vancouver. The Justice Department is investigating Ms. Meng's company, Huawei, on charges of violating sanctions on Iran, and her arrest was meant as a warning shot by the Trump administration in its campaign to limit the global spread of Chinese technology. But it has thrown Mr. Trump's trade negotiations with Beijing into disarray, drawing a sharp protest from the Chinese government and sending financial markets into a panicky swoon, before a modest recovery on Thursday afternoon. The timing of the arrest, some experts said, could feed the suspicion of Chinese officials that nationalist factions in the Trump administration were trying to sabotage the trade deal. Their mood had already soured since Saturday, when the White House announced the two sides had agreed to 90 days of talks, amid confusion over the timetable and doubts that the Chinese would agree to the trade concessions described by Mr. Trump. ""To detain someone without giving clear reason is an obvious violation of human rights,"" said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, who demanded Ms. Meng's immediate release. For Mr. Xi, these experts said, the episode might be seen as an embarrassing loss of face. Huawei and Ms. Meng, who in addition to being the company's chief financial officer is the daughter of its founder, are at the pinnacle of China's corporate world, which will increase the pressure on Mr. Xi to demand her release. It will also increase the pressure on Mr. Trump to weigh the diplomatic fallout of detaining Ms. Meng, especially after a meeting that he hailed as a breakthrough and a testament to his friendship with Mr. Xi. The United States and China have carried on trade negotiations amid such tensions before. Talks continued this year as the administration was planning to punish ZTE, another Chinese technology company that violated American sanctions, though Mr. Trump ultimately offered it a reprieve. ""In the past, the United States has been faced with making a deal with China in one arena while being irritated or highly concerned about others, such as human rights or security,"" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The shoe is now on the other foot, and we will have to see if China can compartmentalize this case."" For American officials and the White House, the fact that Mr. Trump went into the meeting without knowing about the arrest raised questions about whether the president was properly briefed before a sensitive meeting with a foreign leader. While the Justice Department did brief the White House about the impending arrest, Mr. Trump was not told about it. And the subject did not come up at the dinner with Mr. Xi. Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said on NPR that he knew about the arrest in advance, though he did not confirm that he was told about it before the dinner. Such notifications from the Justice Department ""happen with some frequency,"" he said, and ""we certainly don't inform the president on every one of them."" But the Justice Department did give advance notification to the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and its ranking Democrat, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, according to two officials. Former American officials said the awkward timing of it was most likely a coincidence that grew out of the unpredictable travel schedule of Ms. Meng. ""When you have an opportunity to arrest a key figure in a law enforcement operation, you take that opportunity,"" said John E. Smith, the former director of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, who left the administration this year. Still, given the magnitude of the arrest and the country involved, Mr. Smith expressed surprise that the White House officials contacted by the Justice Department did not immediately tell higher-level officials, who could at least tip off the president. The Justice Department has not revealed what Huawei was doing to run afoul of the sanctions. Chinese companies regularly do business in Iran, and much of that trade complies with sanctions regulations. The question appears to be whether Huawei sold technology from the United States to Iran or violated sanctions in some other manner. While the case involving Ms. Meng is related to the unauthorized sale of equipment that could violate sanctions against Iran, F.B.I. counterintelligence agents and federal prosecutors began building criminal cases against Huawei's leadership in 2010, according to a former department official. The effort was led by United States attorneys in offices where Huawei has facilities, including Massachusetts, Alabama, California, New York and Texas — offices that were chosen this fall to lead the Justice Department's efforts to combat Chinese national security threats. As the F.B.I. looked into Huawei, its investigators grew concerned that company officers were working on behalf of the Chinese government. By the time Mr. Trump took office, F.B.I. leaders regularly talked about Huawei almost every day, according to a former official. Mr. Trump has emphasized curbing China's rise as a technological power, increasingly linking trade with national security. The White House has restricted Chinese investment in the United States and hit China with tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, including sensitive products like parts for nuclear reactors and semiconductors. ""In the past, we have dealt with these cases by interrupting the legal process to avoid offending the Chinese Communist Party,"" said Robert Spalding, a retired Air Force general who worked on China issues at the National Security Council until January. ""That is what has made geopolitics so challenging to American interests in the last 20 years."" American officials have raised questions about how closely linked Huawei is to Chinese security agencies and the People's Liberation Army. The founder of Huawei and Ms. Meng's father, Ren Zhengfei, is a former army engineer who has become one of China's most successful entrepreneurs. American officials are pressing other countries to not enter into deals with Huawei on developing fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless service networks. Lawmakers are also rallying against Huawei. In October, two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee — Mr. Warner and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida — wrote Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to urge him to prevent Huawei from supplying equipment for that country's 5G network. In August, Australia banned Huawei and ZTE from providing such equipment. If Ms. Meng were extradited from Canada to stand trial in the United States, prosecutors might try to demonstrate Huawei's ties to the Chinese Communist Party and various state agencies, and to dramatize the potential security compromises related to that. The National Security Agency breached Huawei servers years ago in an effort to investigate its operations and its ties to Chinese security agencies and the military, and to create back doors so the National Security Agency could roam in networks around the globe wherever Huawei equipment was used. How Mr. Trump could have used the information about Ms. Meng's arrest in his meeting with Mr. Xi, had he known about it, is unclear. Telling Mr. Xi that the United States had asked for the arrest of the daughter of one of its most prominent businessmen would have been a drastic move, former officials said, but it might have complicated the efforts of both sides to declare a trade truce. ""A lot depends on the next few days,"" said Michael Pillsbury, a China expert at the Hudson Institute who has advised Mr. Trump. ""This is another challenge to be managed."""
News,2018-12-07,"One day this fall, Ashutosh Garg, the chief executive of a recruiting service called Eightfold.ai, turned up a résumé that piqued his interest.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/business/economy/artificial-intelligence-hiring.html,1667," One day this fall, Ashutosh Garg, the chief executive of a recruiting service called Eightfold.ai, turned up a résumé that piqued his interest. It belonged to a prospective data scientist, someone who unearths patterns in data to help businesses make decisions, like how to target ads. But curiously, the résumé featured the term ""data science"" nowhere. Instead, the résumé belonged to an analyst at Barclays who had done graduate work in physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Though his profile on the social network LinkedIn indicated that he had never worked as a data scientist, Eightfold's software flagged him as a good fit. He was similar in certain key ways, like his math and computer chops, to four actual data scientists whom Mr. Garg had instructed the software to consider as a model. The idea is not to focus on job titles, but ""what skills they have,"" Mr. Garg said. ""You're really looking for people who have not done it, but can do it."" The power of such technology will be immediately apparent to any employer scrambling to fill jobs in a tight labor market — not least positions for data scientists, whom companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are competing to attract. Thanks to services like Eightfold, which rely on sophisticated algorithms to match workers and jobs, many employers may soon have access to a universe of prospective workers — even for hard-to-fill roles — whom they might not otherwise have come across. And while that could also help some candidates, there's a potential downside for job seekers: Such algorithms may also lower wages in these fields, said Bo Cowgill, an economist at Columbia University who has studied the use of artificial intelligence in hiring. ""You get the more nontraditional, equally qualified, equally high-performing people,"" Mr. Cowgill said. But the employer ""doesn't seem to have to compete for them as much."" For years, employers and online intermediaries have used algorithms to help fill job openings, but their methods were often crude. A computer would identify key words on résumés, then determine whether those words corresponded to text in job descriptions. While this approach can be more efficient than manually searching a site like LinkedIn, it has drawbacks. Applicants can game the process by larding their résumés with terms the machines are likely to be looking for. Conversely, poorly worded job listings could cause computers to overlook qualified candidates. But recent advances in a form of artificial intelligence known as deep learning have made the machines used by some companies, like Eightfold and the online job hub ZipRecruiter, far more powerful. Instead of simply scanning words on a page and matching them to words in a job description, a machine can now identify skills and aptitudes that don't explicitly appear on a candidate's résumé. To illustrate, Mr. Garg points out that about 90 percent of software engineers at the financial software company Intuit in Mountain View, Calif., know the programming language Java, according to data Eightfold has analyzed. That means the machine is on safe ground inferring that an Intuit software engineer knows Java, even if he or she doesn't list the skill on a résumé. By performing a similar exercise across an entire résumé, the company's software can build a detailed profile of a job applicant. It can extract more than the usual amount of information from categories like education (certain disciplines at less prominent universities, like natural-language processing at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, produce high-achieving workers) and even hobbies (chess players tend to be good at coding, basketball players at sales). Eightfold, which is based in Silicon Valley, also makes a clever trade with clients: to improve its results, Eightfold asks clients to use its human-resources software, which imports employee data in anonymous form. This includes information on how workers with different backgrounds perform in different jobs, and how much they earn. Eightfold can then use this data to better predict performance — say, how well an Intuit software engineer who plays chess and graduated from the University of Massachusetts might do at Amazon or Microsoft. Intuit did not respond to a request for comment. The software tool can be especially powerful to an employer intent on expanding a search beyond candidates with conventional experience and qualifications. In that case, a recruiter can specify criteria (like industry and location, and even how likely the candidate is to accept an offer) that would turn up less traditional résumés. Claudia Villanueva, a recruiting and diversity official at AdRoll Group, which helps clients with digital ads and marketing, said she recently used Eightfold when trying to fill a financial-planning position. The top candidate had experience in industries the tech world often shuns, like manufacturing. But the Eightfold algorithm flagged her as a winner. ""The tech industry sometimes has a hard time moving past tech experience,"" Ms. Villanueva said. ""We keep hiring the same people in the industry. To me this is a really interesting example of how we broke that cycle a bit."" In the case of the Barclays analyst, Eightfold's software pegged him as a budding data scientist partly because he had a master's degree in statistics and knew computer programming languages like C++ and Matlab, even though he had no apparent background in data science. ""We have gone ahead and analyzed tens of millions to hundreds of millions of profiles of people to see how people have moved in their career,"" Mr. Garg said. ""You can predict what they're likely to do next very easily."" He conceded that the approach worked less well in new or obscure fields with limited data. Steve Goodman, the chief executive of Restless Bandit, another firm that applies artificial intelligence to recruiting, compared the exercise of finding nontraditional candidates to filling a professional sports roster. Sports franchises tend to pay far more for free agents who leave their previous team than for players they draft out of college or high school, because the free agents have a record. But if computers were able to predict the performance of draft picks with relative precision, this could change their calculus. The price of free agents might drop, and the price of signing a draft pick would rise. This is, in effect, what software can accomplish using artificial intelligence. ""We surface people we think would be good draft picks,"" rather than people doing the same jobs, Mr. Goodman said. ""This person is a little more junior, but based on their career track, people who look like them are cheaper and better for you."" Mr. Cowgill, the Columbia economist, said this logic was largely correct, but with one key wrinkle: According to his research, the gains to the less obviously qualified candidates unearthed by machines can be so large that they offset smaller losses to conventional candidates. In a technical field like software engineering, for example, a dropout from a no-name university could end up making a very comfortable living after becoming known to employers. But established coders are sufficiently in demand that wages are likely to remain high even as it becomes easier to find alternatives. In fields requiring fewer technical skills, on the other hand, wages could fall significantly. Consider, say, senior marketing jobs, for which large companies often require a master's degree in business administration. If machines can reliably identify less experienced, less credentialed candidates who are likely to excel, it could depress wages. ""You can think of cases in the product market where people thought they needed something special and you really didn't — the commodity, low-cost person took over,"" said John Horton, a labor economist at N.Y.U. Think of hand-held video cameras after the proliferation of smartphones. ""That could happen in labor markets with the realization that you don't need anything special here,"" Mr. Horton said. All of this presumes, however, that deep-learning technology is viable for use in recruiting and human resources and could eventually become commonplace. Surveys suggest that only a small minority of companies have adopted these tools, and that even fewer feel prepared to exploit them. A recent paper summarizing the findings of a conference at the University of Pennsylvania, involving roughly 20 employers, cited a variety of problems. Among them were the difficulty of measuring employees' performance and the sense of unfairness that workers might feel if a computer were to make hiring, firing and promotion decisions. Perhaps the greatest concern is a basic methodological point — call it the N.B.A. problem. If you were studying National Basketball Association players to figure out what makes one great, you would find almost no correlation between performance and height. Almost everyone in this rarefied world is taller than average. And those who aren't compensate with other gifts, like unusual speed and athleticism. If, on the other hand, you selected people at random from the general population and gauged their basketball potential, you would find that it was highly correlated with height. The concern is that machines are, in effect, only studying N.B.A. players — the people who already have jobs at a company, or even the people who sought jobs — not the general population. Mr. Cowgill believes there are solutions. He wrote a paper showing that seemingly unqualified applicants whom a company accidentally interviews allow a machine to simulate a crude randomized experiment, helping the company learn more about what makes a good employee. But perhaps more telling is that sophisticated technology companies are already using artificial intelligence to help fill jobs. Mr. Garg, who worked as a research scientist at Google for four years, says the company uses such techniques in its recruiting. Google says it uses machines to take a second look at résumés in its database that human recruiters may have missed for a limited set of roles. The advantage that a vendor like Eightfold has, Mr. Garg asserted, is access to internal data at dozens of other companies, something even Google can't claim. ""We now can build much deeper models than these companies can build by themselves,"" he said."
News,2018-12-07,"The Labor Department released its monthly hiring and unemployment figures for November on Friday morning, providing one of the better snapshots of the state of the American economy.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/business/economy/jobs-report.html,1296," The Labor Department released its monthly hiring and unemployment figures for November on Friday morning, providing one of the better snapshots of the state of the American economy. ■ 155,000 jobs were added last month. Economists had expected a gain of about 190,000. The monthly average for September, October and November was 170,000. ■ The unemployment rate remained 3.7 percent. ■ Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent after growing by 0.2 percent in October. The year-over-year gain remained 3.1 percent. After a week when the stock market suffered from motion sickness and presidential tweets caused trade tensions to flare, a weaker-than-expected jobs report may have disappointed some quarters. But faulty forecasts do not mean that the labor market has suddenly stalled. For the 98th month in a row, employers increased payrolls, and monthly job gains are still averaging above 200,000 this year. ""It's obviously an economy that is well in expansion mode but that is coming off the boil after a strong second and third quarter,"" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management. ""So the state of the job market is good. It's just that the pace of job creation is slowing a little bit."" Yearly wage growth remained at 3.1 percent for the second month in a row, a level not seen since the recession. ""If you have solid wage growth while productivity is improving, that is the best of both worlds,"" Mr. Donabedian said. Friday's report is unlikely to discourage policymakers at the Federal Reserve from raising benchmark interest rates when they meet on Dec. 18 and 19. Nonetheless, the report is being seen as a warning flag on some fronts. The recent volatility in the stock market and an increase in the monthly average number of people applying for unemployment benefits has worried people, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG. General Motors said last month that it would idle five plants and cut about 14,000 jobs in North America in part because of a slowdown in auto sales. In October, Ford announced plans to trim its work force. Still, Mr. Rupkey labeled the report ""pretty darn good,"" and said it should help calm the markets. Uncertainty about trade policy is the primary source of anxiety. ""The ball is in the president's court to make sure the China deal is still on,"" he said. ""That is the biggest impediment now."" In the meantime, the labor market is mostly delivering. The unemployment rate and new claims for jobless benefits are at or near record lows. And the average monthly increase in payrolls this year is more than enough to keep the jobless rate below 4 percent. ""People who are working in finance are looking at the stock market,"" said Martha Gimbel, research director at the job-search site Indeed. ""The typical worker just wants to find a good job with hours and rising wages."" That search has been getting easier and easier. Ms. Gimbel said sectors that have had a particularly hard time hiring — like nursing and retailing — are now posting more full-time than part-time jobs, a sign that employers are struggling to find workers. ""Even now,"" she added, ""at this point in the recovery, one of the fastest-growing jobs search terms on Indeed is people looking for 'full-time work.'"" The labor shortage has also finally started benefiting workers who were hit hardest during the recession: minimum-wage earners, African-Americans, Latinos and Americans with fewer skills and less education. Gartner, a research and consulting firm that conducts a quarterly survey of 20,000 employees at companies valued at $100 million or more, found that most workers were extremely optimistic about their ability to find new jobs. At the same time, years of sluggish wage growth and fewer opportunities for advancement have made some workers dissatisfied with their current employers. ""Employees who say they are willing to go above and beyond at work has declined,"" said Brian Kropp, vice president for human resources at Gartner. One out of four employees used to say they were giving their work an extra oomph — something Gartner calls ""discretionary effort."" Now, it's closer to one in six. The reason, Mr. Kropp said, is simple: Workers are not being rewarded for their efforts. ""One of the things we've seen is that it's harder for employees to get promoted nowadays,"" he said. In 2006, for example, it took an average of about two and a half years to get a promotion, compared with four and a half years today. Fears about changing jobs have also eased, he said. Workers are more willing to take the risk of hopping to another employer in search of better compensation. Some of the strongest gains to payrolls this year have been in manufacturing — long a buttress of middle-class employment. In November, manufacturers added 27,000 jobs. That comes on top of the nearly 300,000 positions created in the previous 12 months. The scarcity of people with the training and skills to work in some factories has been a challenge, though. At Western Building Products' banana-shaped factory on the lip of the Menomonee River outside of Milwaukee, workers unloaded pallets of door jambs from a large white container truck this week. Elsewhere, employees sanded down doors that hung back-to-back on a moving conveyor belt, a scaled-down, less colorful version of Disney's animated ""Monsters, Inc."" factory. ""If someone is here a year, they never leave,"" said Mark Willey, president of Western, an employee-owned millwork. ""Our problem today is just finding people who want to work, to show up on time and are willing to apply themselves."" The company has 217 people on staff and expects to raise the total to 230 next year. The average worker earns $16.95 an hour, Mr. Willey said, and gets a generous benefits package. Because the business is 100 percent employee-owned, workers build up equity in the company after a year. Western has used temporary agencies after failing to get enough applicants on its own, and employed inmates at a nearby correctional facility as part of a work-release program. ""When they get released, we hire them,"" he said. ""Some we even hire while they're still in."" This has been a good year and the company is scouting locations to build a new factory, but Mr. Willey expects business to cool over the next couple of years. The shortage of competent workers, not only at factories like Western's but also in construction, is slowing single-family home building at the same time that tariffs have bumped up the cost of materials, he said. He pointed to the aluminum sills that ran along the bottom of doors, and the steel hinges bolted onto the sides. The Commerce Department recently reported that construction of single-family homes fell for the second month in a row in October. Manufacturing and related sectors tend to be more susceptible to economic cycles and are particularly vulnerable to tariffs. Mr. Rupkey of MUFG said that manufacturing had been one of the economy's strongest segments in recent years. ""You wonder how long that's going to continue,"" he said, referring to Mr. Trump's trade policies. Most analysts expect the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rates by a quarter-point, to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. It would be the fourth rate increase this year. But they cautioned that it did increase the likelihood that the Fed would take a more cautious approach next year, following through on its announcements to be more ""data dependent"" and look at the numbers as they come as opposed to following a preset course. Snowstorms in the Midwest and raging wildfires in California may have distorted employment data in November. Last month's figures will be revised twice."
News,2018-12-07,"The last weeks that Phyllis Funke could legally make decisions for herself, she climbed into bed, planning to stay there for a while. It was the end of 2016 and she felt disillusioned with the election and wounded by her brother’s recent move to Texas.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/nyregion/court-appointed-guardianship-like-prison.html,4169," The last weeks that Phyllis Funke could legally make decisions for herself, she climbed into bed, planning to stay there for a while. It was the end of 2016 and she felt disillusioned with the election and wounded by her brother's recent move to Texas. She wasn't considering suicide, she said. She just needed to go under the covers until she could figure out how to deal with the rest of her life, so totally alone. She had credit cards, a car, friends and financial advisers in Maine and New York. When a caseworker from Adult Protective Services and a city psychiatrist entered her apartment on March 3, 2017, clipping the security chain because she did not answer the door, she was unraveling emotionally and physically, at risk of becoming homeless or worse. She had no idea what price she would pay for the intervention. ""I've been bullied, blackmailed and stripped of the things I need to live, including my money,"" she said on a recent afternoon. ""Everything has been taken away from me. I have no access to my bank accounts. I don't have the money to pay for the medications that I'm prescribed. I don't get mail. I can't choose my own doctors."" Ms. Funke had entered the world of adult guardianship. In a city like New York, where people are used to looking past their neighbors, how often do you see someone and ask yourself, Is that person O.K.? Should I call someone? Maybe they're older and not moving well. They look adrift in the produce aisle, or you pass their open apartment door and you can't see the floor for the clutter. You're a paramedic and they're refusing to go to the hospital after a bloody fall. It's your mother or your uncle, and you're worried about the bills piling up, or the email scams or the sudden loan to a stranger. You bandage the wound or you promise to check in tomorrow, or you turn away and get on with your life. Or you call Adult Protective Services. After all, that person needs some sort of protection, doesn't she? For Ms. Funke, that call came from the management of her building, after she didn't respond to court motions to evict her for hoarding. Ms. Funke, 77, has a master's degree from Columbia University, a pilot license and — she believes — several hundred thousand dollars in investments, mostly an inheritance from her parents. She is a scuba diver, an avid reader and a global traveler. She has lived in the same cheap apartment for 41 years. If it were up to her, she said, she would be sailing in the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia right now. She is also, in the eyes of New York State, an ""incapacitated person."" She has been deemed unable to manage her personal needs and property, or to understand the danger she had fallen into. What started as a complaint about clutter grew to affect every aspect of her existence, including her right to make basic decisions about her life, own a gun or enter into certain legal contracts. Her appointed guardian, a former police officer, said he was unsure whether Ms. Funke had the right to marry. ""I feel as if I have absolutely no rights at all in the country in which I was born, and therefore in the rest of the world,"" Ms. Funke said. She compared her situation to being in prison, then thought better of it. ""It's worse than incarceration,"" she said. ""At least in prison you have rights."" If you have heard at all about guardianship for older adults, chances are that it has been about a predatory guardian who plunders the estate of a helpless older person. In New York, the poster victim is a Brooklyn judge named John Phillips, whose guardians sold off more than $20 million of his real estate and left him to freeze to death in 2008 in a facility unlicensed to treat people with dementia. Last month, the United States Senate Committee on Aging called for a major overhaul in the guardianship system, warning that ""unscrupulous guardians"" have used their position to get control of vulnerable people and then ""liquidate assets and savings for their own personal benefit."" When I started to look into guardianship, I expected to find many such clear-cut cases. In New York, anyone can petition to have someone declared incapacitated. A judge may then appoint a family member or a third party, usually a lawyer, to be guardian over the person's physical needs, financial affairs or both. Critics of guardianship say these strangers have open license to raid their wards' estates. But as I met families in contested guardianships, more often the conflicts involved sibling infighting, with children battling for control of their aging parents' assets, crying foul if the courts did not side with them. A retired banker in Brooklyn, for instance, was placed under guardianship after two of her children accused a third of stealing from her. Now they are all in court. On Long Island, a son was trying to keep his frail, blind mother at home, battling a daughter and a guardian who wanted to move her to an assisted-living facility. The son blamed his sister and the guardian and the judge and the court evaluator and a real estate broker. On Manhattan's Upper West Side, a mentally ill woman who was living with her mother became homeless after the mother's guardian obtained a court order barring her from the apartment, because he said she was interfering with the mother's care. These families, too, are in court. Guardianship was where the breakdowns of modern life — broken families, broken health, broken finances and broken bureaucracy — tumbled together in a system that appeared to bring out the worst in people: secretive, confusing and run by lawyers, with extraordinary powers over vulnerable individuals. It was also the last defense for lives that had come undone. Then there was Phyllis Funke. Her letter of introduction began, ""Permit me, please, despite the above-noted 'situation,' to introduce myself. (Assuming 'I' still exist; as I trust you'll gather from the accompanying 'tale,' I've an officially appointed guardian who's doing his darnedest to eradicate 'me' — possibly violating New York City and State laws while denying me all my assets, civil rights, and often telephone service)."" Ms. Funke was something different. She was a journalist and had written freelance articles for The Times, among other places. She said she'd reported from more than 150 countries. Her father, Lewis Funke, had been a drama editor and critic at The Times. Roy Cohn, Senator Joseph McCarthy's notorious counselor, was a distant relation; Dick Morris, the controversial former political consultant, was her stepbrother. When the city workers entered her apartment that day, they found her malnourished, dehydrated, unaware that she was under eviction proceedings or that she had not paid the rent in months. There was almost no food in the apartment, and clutter throughout. As Ms. Funke remembered it, ""They asked me who the president was, and I said, do I really have to say that name?"" She could not say how she got in her mental state; maybe it had to do with a lack of sleep. ""I was eating less and less,"" she recalled later. ""I had pasta, and when I ran out of sauce I used Worcestershire sauce. There were cans of tuna but I couldn't find a can opener, so I used a hammer and an awl. ""The closest I can come is to say I dissociated,"" she said. ""I checked out."" In the coming months, while she recuperated in a nursing home, the protective-services agency petitioned the court to declare her incapacitated and place her under guardianship. In court, the city psychiatrist testified that she suffered from ""unspecified bipolar and related disorder, rule out bipolar II disorder, hoarding disorder and unspecified personality disorder."" The designation ""rule out"" means that further examination was needed to rule out the disorder; according to Ms. Funke, no one ever conducted this examination, and the court records do not indicate any further evaluation. At one court hearing she appeared lucid and persuasive; at the next she was barely coherent. The judge, Shawn T. Kelly, appointed a lawyer named Gil V. Perez to be her guardian, and suspended the eviction proceedings. It was for her own good. Nancy Yonge, a friend of Ms. Funke's from Smith College, saw the case differently. She had visited in late 2016, and found Ms. Funke lucid, planning her next travel adventure. ""She had financial advisers locally and in Maine who were looking after her resources,"" Ms. Yonge said. ""I do believe this case is all about the money. If she didn't have money, they wouldn't be after her this way."" By the time I visited Ms. Funke this summer, she said that her dissociative state had passed, and that she was ""sentient."" Her apartment: books galore, yarn sticking out of a cabinet door, couch piled with knitting supplies and a laptop, wall art from her travels, room for two people to sit. Nothing outrageous. The next time I returned the papers had doubled, covering the couch and parts of the floor. She was working on her case, she said. She produced a letter from a psychiatrist declaring her stable and ""perfectly competent to handle all her affairs."" In a country that guarantees the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, at what point does a person forfeit the right to make bad decisions? Some numbers would be helpful here: how many people are in guardianship, what assets they have, how many petitions are accepted or rejected. Unfortunately, those numbers do not exist in any meaningful way. Guardianship records are kept separately by each of New York's 62 counties, with no standardized reporting and no state or city totals. Other states are similar. ""Why are there not systems in place?"" asked Pamela Teaster, director of the Center for Gerontology at Virginia Tech University, who is studying New York's guardianship system. ""When you look for a shirt on the internet, your email will be filled with ads for shirts. We can't track who's under guardianship and their ages and health status."" A ""best guess"" by the National Center for State Courts put the number of people in guardianship nationally at between one million and three million. In Manhattan, a database used by the court lists 2,596 guardianship cases for incapacitated adults, though some of these people may have died. Other numbers do exist. Since last August, when the process started, Ms. Funke has been billed $16,800 by her court-appointed lawyer; $3,437 by a court evaluator, who deemed her in need of guardianship; $5,000 by her first temporary guardian, Mr. Perez, whose original request for $13,790 was slashed by the judge; at least $9,050 by her current guardian, who took over last November; plus money for a geriatric care manager and home attendants, whom Ms. Funke resents. (All fees must be approved by the judge.) Whenever the various players convened, the meter for Ms. Funke ran at close to $1,000 an hour, for a process she did not want. When New York enacted its statute governing guardianship for older or frail adults, Article 81 of the Mental Hygiene Law, in 1992 (a different statute covers people with intellectual or developmental disabilities), it was considered a progressive model, requiring guardians to provide the least restrictive conditions possible and consider their wards' preferences in all decisions. ""It's a great statute,"" said Kristin Booth Glen, a former judge who helped write Article 81 and now advocates for an alternative to guardianship called supported decision making. ""And if people actually applied it, we wouldn't have a lot of people under guardianship. But they don't. That's the problem."" Instead, she said, judges have found it safer to overprotect people, and guardians, who bill their wards at steep hourly rates, have only their own moral incentives to do a good job — their clients are too incapacitated to object, and court monitoring is minimal. How minimal? Though the statute requires guardians to report on their wards' assets and care within 90 days, a study of cases in 14 New York counties found that it took an average of 237 days, and then 210 days before anyone read it. This leaves families feeling powerless and uninformed. Bars to entry are low: in New York, aspiring guardians must complete a one-day certification course. A 2010 report by the federal Government Accountability Office found that the courts conducted no background checks, relying on the applicants to disclose any criminal convictions or recent bankruptcies. Once someone is under guardianship, it is very difficult to get out, because any resistance can be treated as evidence that they are at risk to themselves, so they need protection. For emotionally fragile people, the stress of guardianship — of paying to have your rights transferred to someone else — can make them even more fragile. And if a relative opposes a guardian's actions, everyone involved — the guardian, lawyers for both the guardian and the ward, the court evaluator and possibly others — can bill the ward for their time. ""It's total overkill, it's completely unconstitutional and it's done every day,"" Ms. Glen said. ""And it's done in the name of protection. And the real question is, does it actually protect people? There's no evidence that it does. When you give one person total power over another person's life, including the power to isolate that person, you're setting them up for abuse and neglect and exploitation."" Guardians and judges complain that the system is vastly underfunded, and that most wards have little or no assets to pay for time-consuming work. Several nonprofit organizations provide guardianship for poor individuals. Jean Callahan, who oversees low-income guardianship cases as attorney in charge at the Legal Aid Society's Brooklyn neighborhood office, likened guardianship to nursing homes. ""It's not what anyone would choose, but I'm glad they're there,"" she said. ""It's a blunt instrument, but it does solve problems sometimes."" Even then, though, it transforms one sort of bad situation — the descent into helplessness — into another, which is a supported death. There are no happy outcomes. Phyllis Ellen Funke grew up in the Parkchester section of the Bronx and later Mount Vernon, a high-achieving teenager with a lust for travel and occasional bouts of depression. She wanted to be an actress, she said, but turned to journalism after her father threatened to thwart her in order to protect her from the casting couch. ""He would never believe there was an editing couch,"" she said, alleging a demand for sex from an editor at a major Jewish publication. She mentioned other people who sabotaged her career or wounded her. It was a theme of her conversation. ""She doesn't have delusions,"" her brother, Michael, said. ""She can have strong opinions."" Friends thought she never got over her father's disapproval. She got writing assignments from prestigious publications but never turned them into an income of more than $5,000 or $6,000 a year. Her rent, set at 30 percent of her net income, once dropped to $97 a month. ""I remember almost constant complaining about her father,"" said Morton Fleischner, a friend from journalism school who went on to be a producer at ABC News. Ms. Funke traveled and wrote and traveled and wrote. She acquired stuff on her travels and put it in her apartment, and acquired research materials for future trips and put these in her apartment as well. She bought scuba gear from the shop next door. She bought yarn for knitting. In 2004, the building moved to evict her for hoarding, but her parents helped her tidy up. Bill Lambrecht, 81, a neighbor and friend for more than 30 years, dismissed her clutter as a harmless eccentricity. ""Her apartment was always really messy,"" he said. ""I'd see pennies on the floor, clothes shoved everywhere. She doesn't hoard things. She just throws things on the floor."" Mr. Lambrecht accompanied Ms. Funke to a court conference this August. He had been a guardian for an older woman once, and did not think Ms. Funke needed that level of oversight. At the conference, Judge Kelly called Ms. Funke ""a brilliant woman,"" but he added, on the guardianship question, ""That ship has sailed."" The judge offered to address any problems she was having with her new guardian, Charles Barbuti, adding that this was not the time to reopen the case — for that she had to fill out a form called an Order to Show Cause. He had explained that last time, Judge Kelly said. Ms. Funke began at the beginning. Digressions opened into other digressions. When Judge Kelly stopped her, she simply started again. ""I'm begging you,"" Judge Kelly said. ""I have spent more time on your case than on any single other case on my docket."" He ended the conference to hear the next case. Mr. Lambrecht said: ""She's lucid, intelligent and knows how to take care of herself, mostly. She never cuts to the chase on things. But she's not a bad person in any way. She's very lonely. She's what you'd call a noodge."" Outside the courtroom Ms. Funke snagged Mr. Barbuti. ""I need money to pay for my medication."" ""Send me the bills, I'll pay them."" She could not do this, she said, for a simple reason. ""I'm not taking the medication."" It was a standoff. Mr. Barbuti billed $250 an hour. Sheila O'Brien, the geriatric care manager, stood by. She billed $150 an hour, plus $75 an hour for travel time to and from her office in Connecticut. The judge ordered home-care aides to tackle Ms. Funke's clutter — twice a week, four hours each time. Ms. Funke wanted to hire a cleaning service instead. Often she refused to allow the home attendants into her apartment. This was seen as noncompliance, further grounds to continue guardianship. ""I want to see this work for you, I really do,"" Judge Kelly told her. ""I know you don't want this. Help me make it work."" If you made that call to Adult Protective Services about Ms. Funke, did you do the right thing? The initial intervention brought her back from the edge of malnutrition and dehydration. Judge Kelly stopped the eviction proceedings and ordered help to keep the clutter from returning. But at what cost? In Ms. Funke's view, the process was an assault on her liberty — and in one instance, on her person. Before a court hearing last November, when she refused to get out of bed, the guardian, Gil Perez, forced the issue. What happened is in dispute. Ms. Funke said Mr. Perez dragged her out of bed, slammed her head repeatedly against the wall, then dragged her out toward the elevator in her nightgown. At the hearing that day, Judge Kelly noted that she was disheveled and unresponsive. ""Ms. Funke,"" he said, ""you just don't seem yourself to me today."" Mr. Perez did not respond to requests for comment. At the hearing he told the judge, ""Today, getting her to this court was quite an adventure."" Ms. Funke said nothing. Nathan Villada, a paramedic who was helping Ms. Funke after her initial crisis, cleaning the apartment and taking her to medical appointments, said Mr. Perez was physical but not violent in the way she described. ""This was when Phyllis was doing really, really badly mentally,"" Mr. Villada said. ""She was yelling obscenities and it seemed like she was making aggressive movements toward him. So Gil started grabbing her hands. And that just made her more aggressive. Gil pushed her against the bookshelf more as a restraint, not slamming her. My personal preference, I don't think there's a necessity to touch someone like that. She started yelling out, 'Help, help, I'm being raped.' He pushed her out into the hallway, but he didn't drag her on the floor."" Ms. Yonge said Ms. Funke had called her at the time and told her about the episode, describing it as an ""assault."" ""She was in tears about it,"" Ms. Yonge said. Over time, Ms. Funke began to see this encounter as the root of her problems, and all the court's interventions as more harmful than helpful. If she hadn't been roughed up, she wouldn't have been listless in court that day. If she hadn't been listless, she would have persuaded the judge that she did not need a guardian. Ms. Funke also said that a social worker from Adult Protective Services propositioned her and touched her inappropriately, and that Mr. Villada and his girlfriend had stolen from her. Whatever the validity of her charges, the anguish she feels is clearly real. Mr. Barbuti, who succeeded Mr. Perez as her guardian, said he had not looked into her charges. That was police work, he said, and he was no longer in that line. (He was a captain in the Bronx until he retired in 2011.) ""I can't subpoena people,"" he said. ""Interviewing people and giving Miranda warnings are far beyond the ambit of what I can do."" It can all be maddening. Claude Pepper, a congressman from Florida, once called guardianship ""the most punitive civil penalty that can be levied against an American citizen, with the exception, of course, of the death penalty."" One day in her apartment, Ms. Funke tried to refuse a scheduled visit from Ms. O'Brien and a home attendant. They came up anyway. Ms. Funke treated them with open disdain. The attendant pointed to a creased throw rug on the floor. ""We talked about this, Phyllis,"" she said. Risk of falls. Ms. Funke saw the apartment through different eyes, as a journal of her travels. ""Each rug means something to me,"" she said. ""Each has a story attached to it."" Maybe this wasn't prison, but for Ms. Funke, it was four walls and no easy way out. Was there money left in her investment accounts? Even the court didn't know. Only the guardian had access to her records. Ms. Funke said Mr. Barbuti often failed to give her the $150 a week allotted by the court, and that he was late paying bills for her parking garage, car insurance, her phone and internet, and that her supplemental health insurance was expired. In court Mr. Barbuti told the judge that he could not pay some of her bills because she refused to provide them to him. Some days it seemed like she spent more time fighting with Mr. Barbuti over her bills than it would take to manage them, and they were still a royal mess, she said. Mr. Barbuti said people had the wrong idea about guardians, that their powers were limited to what the judge gave them. New York also limited runaway fees: if a guardian billed more than $75,000 in a year, he or she could not take any new cases the following year. ""There's a misconception about guardianship, that somehow or other you become that person's alter ego,"" Mr. Barbuti said. ""That's just not the case. All you can do is what the court tells you you can do."" He added: ""I like this kind of work. I feel there's a chance to help somebody and make a difference in their lives."" If you were Ms. Funke, shouldn't you be allowed to withdraw into the covers if you wanted to? And the clutter in your apartment — couldn't people understand that a writer needs materials around? Even if she were evicted, she had money to start somewhere else. Courts evict people with lots less. If you were Judge Kelly, what would you do? Would you want to be the judge who left her vulnerable and unprotected? Mr. Barbuti said the question of guardianship was a complex one. ""People should have the right to make their own decisions, even if you might look at it and I might look at it or a judge might look at it and say that's not a good decision,"" he said. ""I don't think the government should be making decisions like that for people. I think people should be able to make bad decisions. Within bounds."" What these bounds were, he could not say. Ms. Funke said she just wanted to get on with her life. As she approached 80, she worried that she might spend the rest of her years fighting to get out of guardianship. So she fought harder. She remained on probation at her building. By early December she was still writing her Order to Show Cause. It began, ""I'm petitioning, very simply, for the return of my life. The chance to hope again, to dream again. And live the years that remain in a fulfilling and fulfilled manner. Too much has already been destroyed — much improperly; possibly illegally. And primarily — -carelessly, selfishly and pointlessly."" Fifteen pages later, it still had a long way to go. She was working on it, she said."

AMERICA, COMPROMISED By Lawrence Lessig 251 pp. The University of Chicago Press. $24. Among President Trump's major accomplishments is the booming industry in books about him, his administration, the state of democracy in America, the rise of autocracy in America and abroad, the reasons for his rise, the bases of his support, the state of the Republican Party, the state of his mental health or lack thereof, the chaos in his White House and so on. Not all are strictly about Trump — the fact is the conditions and dynamics that brought us Trump long preceded him, and the changes in the fabric of our Republic are paralleled by changes in other longstanding democracies around the globe. Two of the nation's top public intellectuals are adding to this expansive genre with short books designed for broad audiences. Neither is fundamentally about Trump; indeed, one barely mentions the president. But both are about the America that Trump's ascent now typifies. Alan Wolfe, a distinguished professor emeritus at Boston College and prolific scholar of American political thought, gives us ""The Politics of Petulance: America in an Age of Immaturity."" ""America, Compromised"" is by Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, the former head of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics and an activist on campaign finance. Wolfe's is two books in one: first, a polemic, aimed at Trump and his supporters, and at the broader fabric of our age; second, a brief intellectual history of modern America. He sets his frame early on: ""It is … not an explanation of one rogue election we need. It is a discussion of what kind of nation we have become."" To get there, Wolfe focuses intensely on the so-called McCarthy era, the period in the 1950s when Senator Joseph McCarthy used deception, lies and demagogy to create an atmosphere of fear and division. Wolfe draws some parallels with today's Trump era (beyond those of fear, division and deception, there is a direct link: McCarthy's henchman Roy Cohn became Trump's Svengali). But his book is less about McCarthy or his tactics and more about the views of a swath of political thinkers and public intellectuals who arose in that era to take on the ideas that made McCarthyism a threat to our democracy. Wolfe describes and examines a host of postwar political thinkers, many of whom, like Hannah Arendt and Joseph Schumpeter, had come from the horrors of Europe, but he focuses even more on a core group of American-born intellectuals like Richard Hofstadter, Daniel Bell, Lionel Trilling, Nathan Glazer, Irving Kristol, Seymour Martin Lipset and Reinhold Niebuhr, those he calls ""mature liberals."" They set out the values and behaviors that embody what Wolfe views as political maturity, taking on both the world-government left and the populist, demagogic right. Wolfe is at his best when he is discussing these writers, first-class thinkers who responded powerfully to their era's challenges. He contrasts their response to what he sees as the lamer reaction of the contemporary intellectual community to Trump — and suggests we no longer have a core of all-star intellectuals but instead a shallower group of ""thought leaders."" And he tries to draw lessons from the writing of the old school of mature liberals to apply to the present day, a time, he says, when our political immaturity has led to the politics of petulance. The intellectuals Wolfe admires made a case for the appreciation of subtlety, ambiguity, intellectual curiosity and tolerance of divergent views — all qualities that are abundant in the world of thought but have never been cherished by the broader electorate. As he points out, James Bryce wrote 130 years ago, ""The ordinary American voter does not object to mediocrity."" Wolfe notes, of course, that McCarthyism lost, which he attributes in large part to the eloquent and sustained pushback from these public intellectuals (although he stresses that it had taken the horrors of a depression and a huge war to remind liberals of their calling and responsibility). He lays out the conditions that led to our current crisis, but implies that these days we have neither the impetus from horrific conditions nor the intellectual heft to transcend Trump and Trumpism and to move beyond our current ""immature democracy."" Certainly, there are reasons this era is different, but blaming a lack of intellectual heft both overemphasizes the importance of intellectuals and largely dismisses a pretty impressive collection of present-day thinkers, including many of the Never-Trumpers calling for a reassertion of conservative values from the right, and scholars of political thought, race and authoritarianism showing courage and fortitude from the center and left. He also does not give enough emphasis to other conditions: the rise of partisanship extending even to the courts, the importance of tribal media in a new communications age, the obliteration of campaign finance rules that had put some limits on the power of the oligarchic class. Focused as he is on ideas, Wolfe does not end with a series of reforms to reverse our decline. Instead, he offers advice to his readers: Don't be petulant, appreciate the nobility of politics, trust experts, avoid conspiracy theorizing, don't believe candidates who promise only good news, pay attention to political debates, be sensitive to norms and not just laws. All good ideas, but Wolfe has no road map or magic wand to get most Americans to buy into them. ""America, Compromised"" is about the country in the Trump era, but not about Trump. Indeed, Lessig would have written much the same book if Hillary Clinton were president and if Democrats had control of both houses of Congress. His focus is not on bad people doing bad things, but on how incentives across a range of institutions have created corruption, with deleterious consequences for the nation. Anyone who has seen Lessig's mesmerizing TED Talk about Congress and political money knows the basis for this book, now extended to discuss a wider range of institutions, including finance, the media, the medical profession, the academy and the law. All of them, he says, have become corrupted by norms and misplaced incentives that in turn corrupt the behavior of actors who are themselves operating not out of venality but are caught in institutional webs. The rest of us? We inflict the greatest harm on society because we enable them. For Congress, Lessig notes that the framers were deeply concerned about corruption, but rarely focused on the evils of individual quid pro quos. They worried about institutions, the danger of politicians becoming dependent on forces beyond the voters who elected them — or, as Madison wrote, ""the people alone."" Congress, Lessig believes, is corrupt even though the overwhelming majority of congresspeople are not. The institutional corruption here comes from political money. It corrupts the agenda, the issues that get the focus and attention, and moves Congress away from the needs and concerns of the voters. While our political institutions were not all or mainly linked to voters, at least not directly, the House of Representatives is and was meant to be a channel for the voices of the people. It has become something else entirely. Similarly, Lessig's chapter on the media, in which he examines technology meeting market forces, reinforces the sense of dysfunction that flows from distorted incentives. One need only look at Facebook for a current example. With regard to finance, Lessig examines in different ways the 2008 collapse, from banks to ratings agencies that gave AAA ratings to entities that were absurdly dangerous. These agencies were created in the 19th century, and have had impeccable reputations because of their perceived independence and objectivity. But, Lessig says, the big three ratings agencies, designated as official by the Securities and Exchange Commission, compete to get the lucrative business of analyzing securities. Good ratings mean more business. Bad ratings, not so much. With financial institutions playing one agency off against the others, the results were predictable. Lessig quotes Roger Lowenstein, the author of a book on Wall Street: ""Imagine the big rating agencies as three competitive saloons standing side by side, with each free to set its own drinking age. Before long, 9-year-olds would be downing bourbon."" The ratings failures were key contributors to the financial collapse. Individuals in the agencies did not take bribes — it was the perverse incentives that corrupted the institutions. In his essay on the academy, Lessig first writes scathingly of the psychiatric profession. In the era of miracle medications promising relief or cures, psychiatry has become captive to the pharmaceutical industry, altering the ways diseases have been classified and drugs prescribed. Other parts of the academic world have been corrupted as well, Lessig writes, with experts as hired guns who are now paid to testify. What's more, legislation sponsored by the Democrat Birch Bayh and the Republican Bob Dole and passed in 1980 was intended to encourage academics to bring their research to the marketplace. But giving financial incentives to the academics for their work meant both more commercialism at public expense and more reasons for scientists to keep their findings secret, hindering the free exchange of research findings. Some of Lessig's toughest words are for his own profession, the law. Lawyers used to prosecute white-collar crime, without partisanship or other biases. But somehow, in the aftermath of the catastrophic financial crisis in 2008, not a single individual miscreant was brought to the bar of justice. Why? Start with the fact that the gap between the incomes of prosecutors and lawyers in firms has ballooned; a prosecutor now struggles for a good life relative to his or her law school colleagues in the private sector. That has led to a revolving door between prosecutors' offices and white-collar defense firms. Being ""hirable"" means public officials can't be too hard on firms they might eventually join. It is not a matter of greed, but of distorted incentives leading to unsettling behavior. What to do? Lessig examines a range of ways to de-corrupt institutions. As with so many efforts, it is hard to find remedies that are realistic and practical. Still, some of Lessig's ideas are not just pie in the sky. He recommends public financing for campaigns; delinking rating agencies and experts offering testimony from those paying for it; and using in-depth polls to gauge public opinion on key issues as a kind of shadow government. That two impressive public intellectuals like Alan Wolfe and Lawrence Lessig are weighing in on the challenges of our times, joining so many others, is reassuring. ""The Politics of Petulance"" and ""America, Compromised"" join an impressive array of books and essays that may, someday, have a future intellectual historian using them as examples to lament the fact that his or her contemporaries are not as eloquent or important as the group that arose in the Trump era to combat the threats to our way of life."
News,2018-12-07,"LOS ANGELES — They are the forgotten people of Los Angeles — 1,457 people, to be exact. Old, poor, homeless, babies born premature and abandoned.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/us/los-angeles-dead-homeless.html,905," LOS ANGELES — They are the forgotten people of Los Angeles — 1,457 people, to be exact. Old, poor, homeless, babies born premature and abandoned. They may have died alone, but they were buried together, in a mass grave, and were honored together this week in an interfaith ceremony that has been an annual ritual in Los Angeles for more than a century. On a chilly Wednesday morning, on a green hillside in Boyle Heights and just as the country was paying tribute to a former president, George Bush, Los Angeles County honored what it calls its ""unclaimed dead."" ""I think it is appropriate that on the same day that we mourn the loss of a commander in chief, we also mourn the loss of individuals whose deaths did not receive national attention, or much attention at all, but whose lives were no less worthy of our recognition,"" Janice Hahn, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said at the service. The county does not have to do this, but the tradition, which dates back to 1896, has become a sacred event for the many county workers — coroners, researchers — whose job it is to investigate how people die in Los Angeles. Their work is a long process of figuring out who these people were, and if there are loved ones looking for them. Nearly all of the forgotten Angelenos honored this year died in 2015, and in most cases a relative was found but for whatever reason — financial hardship, estrangement — they did not want to claim the remains. The county keeps a list online of each person's name, date of birth, date of death, and the date of cremation. All were cremated, and some lived long lives: Maria Bulgier was 103 when she died; Grace Wetzel, 92. Others have no names. Baby Boy Manor is listed as being born and having died on the same day: Oct. 6, 2015. The county keeps remains for three years, and if no one claims them they are buried in the mass grave, and honored with a ceremony on the first Wednesday of December. ""Some of these individuals were homeless, many were poor, some were newborn babies, and tragically many of them have no loved ones to grieve for them,"" Ms. Hahn said. She continued, ""At one point, these people had parents. At one point these people had friends. At one point, these people laughed and loved and cried like the rest of us."" For a big, sprawling region like Los Angeles County, the ceremony is also an annual exercise in community — many members of the public return, year after year — in a place that can often feel isolating. Some 200 people attended this year. Stefan Timmermans, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who researches how people die and how communities grieve, began attending several years ago as part of his work. He has spent time with workers at the medical examiner's office, diving into files and going on ride-alongs with coroners. But he has kept attending the ceremony because he found it personally meaningful. ""I just find it also very moving and very touching that people come together around this, and there's something very powerful about stepping up to the plate, taking time from L.A. traffic and your everyday life,"" he said. ""It contrasts very strongly with the abandonment of these people."" He said the ceremony was ""sort of like an antidote to the isolation and alienation you can have in big cities, which is reflected in the many unclaimed, about 1,500 in L.A. County every year."" Phillip Gruber, who works in health services for the county, said he had been meaning to come for many years, and finally did this year, ""to see how our society finds a way to honor people who have been apart."" ""Our highest ideal is to treat each other with dignity and respect no matter who you are,"" he said. Reflecting the diversity of Los Angeles, there were representatives of many spiritual traditions at the ceremony: Christian, Jewish, Native American, Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist. A man with an oboe played Bach, and a choir sang ""Amazing Grace."" Those gathered placed flowers on the grave site, on a plot of land that has long been a final resting place for the forgotten of Los Angeles: More than a decade ago, the century-old remains of Chinese laborers were discovered nearby as workers were digging a tunnel for the extension of the city's subway. Walking back to the parking lot after the ceremony, Mary Bonderove, who came from Whittier to attend for the first time, had tears in her eyes. ""Every life matters,"" she said. Her friend Elena DeGarmo, a retired accountant, has been coming for several years. ""Every life deserves someone to witness the end of it and be a witness that they were here,"" she said. ""In L.A., between homelessness and poverty, people just get tossed away."" In a column published this week in The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Timmermans and his research partner, Pamela Prickett, a professor at the University of Amsterdam, wrote of the anonymous lives of the city's forgotten. ""Their stories won't be told: family strife, alienation, perhaps addiction, poverty or violence in a big city,"" he wrote. The column continued, ""These aren't happy Hollywood endings,"" he continued. ""But at least when these people die, Los Angeles doesn't abandon them."""

We've all seen New York through the eyes of the Hollywood dream machine in a way that could not fool us, the native New Yorkers. We've scowled at streets that were supposed to be Harlem but were clearly a backlot in Burbank, Calif. We've shook our heads at shimmering skyscrapers that were meant to be the financial district but were obviously Toronto or Vancouver. And perhaps the worst: We've watched characters who are not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe hop on a subway in TriBeCa and arrive, moments later, in Washington Heights.  Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, Daniel Palladino, the show's creators, are both California natives, but they know and love New York. ""We grew up separately in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles and have spent most of our lives there,"" said Mr. Palladino, ""but always had this fascination with New York and just really needed a good excuse to be out here permanently. Which we are now — we live in Brooklyn.""  Ms. Sherman-Palladino explained, ""The big thing about a show like ours is, any network or studio is going to want to not do it in New York, because it's expensive. We had a long talk with Amazon about the fact that this show cannot become a show that becomes people talking in rooms, because it's not that show. It needs breath and air, and it needs to live out on the streets."" The streets of New York come to life in both Seasons 1 and 2 of ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel."" Even those of us who weren't born during the era the show portrays watched with delight as the show depicted places and spaces of New York lore — the Gaslight Cafe nightclub, Kettle of Fish bar and the Carnegie Deli among them. As the second season debuted on Dec. 5, we asked the creators to look at photos from our archives and to share their thoughts about the New York as shot by Times photographers and the New York of their show.  DANIEL PALLADINO Right off the bat, a big thing for us and our production designer is that back then signage was much more prevalent. In the photo of Eighth Street [above], I'm struck by signage that you see here on both sides of the streets. Back then, if you went to a grocery store, the windows would just be covered from head to toe with signage: advertising goose livers, prices, ""Come on in!"" — all that stuff, at all different kinds of angles. Much more than we do today. So we're constantly slapping signage up.  AMY SHERMAN-PALLADINO All this stuff is like the layering of the signs, and the signs within the signs. We had a lot of talk about layers, and a lot of talk about the signage. Because the period was that period of like, ""We're on the upswing, and the last decade was sad, and we conquered the world. We're America."" So that feeling was pulsating through the city.  PALLADINO There'd be a sign over a sign, and then a sign sticking out, and a sign up here and a sign up there. SHERMAN-PALLADINO I want to live somewhere with a big neon ""babka,"" that sounds like heaven to me.""  PALLADINO This looks like an uptown crowd came downtown a little bit. It's a pretty white crowd. It looks like they came from work. And they would do that, we had in our pilot, we had Midge and Joel's friends, the Clearys came down, it was very exotic for them to go downtown. There were people who, as you know, to this day, if you live uptown, sometimes they never go downtown. And if you live downtown, they never go uptown, unless it's for theater or something.  SHERMAN-PALLADINO The other thing is, if you look at a lot of these Village pictures, the men didn't wear hats in the Village, they wore hats uptown. So if you look at a lot of these Village pictures, they are in black and white, but these guys could be wearing this today. It's a little bit less of the Doris Day feeling, because people look much more modern in these pictures.  PALLADINO It was Kennedy not wearing a hat to his inauguration that made men think, ""Maybe I shouldn't wear a hat."" It's kind of a shame. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Hats are great. PALLADINO This looks like Italy a little bit with the motorbike and Borgia. But you also notice the other thing is there are more trees now. There weren't nearly as many trees, they were just planting them. SHERMAN-PALLADINO So the trees were like sticks. That's another thing that we have to deal with downtown, you have these blocks where there's tree, tree, tree, and it feels like the Upper West Side, because there just weren't trees there. They didn't have that in the Village. SHERMAN-PALLADINO There is a lot of unchanged in New York, but it's surrounded by a lot of change. We'll go and we'll shoot something, and then our special effects will come in and do all the cleanup. And the cleanup is crazy, from locks to the cages on the air-conditioners, not the air-conditioners themselves, but the cages, security cameras. PALLADINO Satellite dishes, A.T.M.'s. Everything is everywhere, and we erase so much stuff. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Oh my god. Look at this. PALLADINO This is something we should keep in mind, maybe. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Four women, one room, that's a nightmare. That's so great. ""Singles Week."" Of course. PALLADINO ""Singles Week,"" what does that mean? Was it before or after the normal season? SHERMAN-PALLADINO It's August. PALLADINO That's right in the thick of the season, the whole week of just singles?  SHERMAN-PALLADINO Not by the end of the week. SHERMAN-PALLADINO This is a great picture. PALLADINO I would say it's [the actor] George Hamilton doing the frug or something in 1964. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Look at that! And this would not be the only show that night, right? That's the amazing thing. PALLADINO This is thousands of people. We do an episode where we're saying she's at the Concord, but there was no way we could recreate a theater this wide with this many people … We want to make it look like the modern world, but the modern world for them was 1959, 1960. So that's what Amy was saying, that a lot of times when you see movies especially, but a lot of television shows that are set in the '20s or in the '40s or the '50s. SHERMAN-PALLADINO They'll do it in the '70s, like everything in the '70s was orange. PALLADINO They'll add a color of patina to the cinematography that is supposed to make it look like 1970 or 1960 to our eyes, but again, back then the world wasn't orange. It was bright and colorful. So I think the vintage aspect comes into effect in the costume, in the wardrobe and the production design.  SHERMAN-PALLADINO And New York is 1700s, 1800s, early 1900s, it's everything layered upon, layered upon, layered upon. When you look at the Maisel apartment, it's not just all 1950s — there're pieces that would have been in Rose's family from the 1800s and mixed up, because everyone's apartment is a mixture of what your life has been up until then, not just a snapshot in time in that moment. Nobody goes out and furnishes an entire apartment in one day, and then that's how they live. SHERMAN-PALLADINO We wanted to make sure that when we photographed New York, it didn't have any sort of filter or sepia tone feel that made it feel quaint or old-fashioned or old-timey. Because you see the people in these pictures, they're walking quickly, there's an energy, there's a vibrancy, even just to the pictures of New York. Especially during that time, because it was postwar and things were on the upswing, and there was so much innovation. It was, ""Buy a washing machine, buy a car, buy this and buy that.""  PALLADINO We always make a point to everybody that these people, they're our past, but they thought they were living in a modern world. And they were living in a modern world. So one of the things we tell our extras who come in — we have to tell some of our guest actors this — but we tell our extras, too, ""Don't walk down the street in the scene like you're in 1959, just walk down the street."" Because they didn't know they were in 1959. SHERMAN-PALLADINO Don't try to be old-timey. This interview has been condensed and edited for length and clarity."
briefing,2018-12-07,(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/briefing/huawei-angela-merkel-kevin-hart.html,1394," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with the fallout from the arrest of a Chinese executive, proposed rollbacks of environmental regulations and  the latest from the midterm elections. We also invite you to share your thoughts about our new design. The arrest over the weekend of a top executive at Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, has complicated President Trump's trade talks with Beijing and drawn sharp protests from the Chinese government.  Meng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, was arrested in Canada at Washington's request, which is seen as a warning shot against the growing influence of Chinese technology. The Justice Department is investigating the company on charges of violating sanctions on Iran. Reaction: ""To detain someone without giving clear reason is an obvious violation of human rights,"" said a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, demanding Ms. Meng's release.  Side effects: The news contributed to whiplash for global markets on Thursday, but things seem more stable today. Background: The U.S. has considered Huawei a security threat for years, and other countries are expressing increased concern, too.  The administration outlined plans on Thursday to open nine million acres in the American West to drilling and mining by removing protections for the sage grouse, an imperiled ground-nesting bird. Reaction: The proposal, which is expected to be finalized next year, drew immediate criticism from environmentalists and praise from energy-industry representatives. Background: The plan is part of an effort to promote more oil and gas drilling on public land in support of what Mr. Trump calls a policy of American ""energy dominance."" Related: The administration is also expected to submit a proposal next week that would significantly weaken a major Obama-era regulation to protect the sources of drinking water for about a third of the country.  Republicans conceded a seventh congressional seat in California on Thursday, meaning that Democrats are likely to take 40 House seats from Republicans in the new Congress.  David Valadao, who has represented Central California since 2013, had initially been declared the winner, but his Democratic opponent, T.J. Cox, pulled ahead when mail-in votes were counted. In North Carolina: The congressional campaign of the Republican Mark Harris disclosed that it owed more than $34,000 to a company whose work on absentee ballots and voter turnout has prompted fears of election fraud and called his narrow victory into question. In Michigan: Republicans, following the example of lawmakers in Wisconsin, moved to limit the powers of the incoming Democratic secretary of state. They also prepared to curb the authority of Democrats who will take over as governor and attorney general in January. Victorina Morales, a housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., is also an undocumented immigrant. Sandra Diaz, who is now a legal resident of the U.S., said she, too, was undocumented when she worked at the club from 2010 to 2013. The two women said they were not the only workers at Bedminster who were in the country illegally, although there is no evidence that Mr. Trump or Trump Organization executives knew of the women's immigration status. Notable: Mr. Trump has made border security and the fight to protect jobs for Americans a cornerstone of his presidency. Response: The Trump Organization, which owns the golf course, said in a statement: ""If an employee submitted false documentation in an attempt to circumvent the law, they will be terminated immediately."" The White House declined to comment. How we know: Ms. Morales and Ms. Diaz approached The Times through their lawyer, who is representing them on immigration matters. As part of its verification of this article, The Times reviewed Ms. Morales's pay stubs and W-2 forms, which list the golf course as her employer. Mrs. Obama, pictured above as a college student at Princeton, is the descendant of the very caste of people that some of her predecessors in the White House owned.  Her new memoir is ""a serious work of candid reflection by a singular figure of early-21st-century America,"" according to Isabel Wilkerson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Times journalist and the author of ""The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration.""  Monthly jobs report: The U.S. economy added 155,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department reported today. The unemployment rate was unchanged from the month before, at 3.7 percent.  Final farewell for George Bush: After a funeral service for the former president in Houston on Thursday, his body was carried 70 miles by train to his presidential library in College Station, Tex., where he was laid to rest. German politics: After 18 years under the leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Christian Democratic Union party is set to elect a new leader today. Here's a look at the leading candidates to replace her. Featured videos: Standout actors including Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke turn common experiences into enchanting moments of dance for The Times Magazine's annual Great Performers issue. Kevin Hart controversy: Days after the comedian was named the host of next year's Academy Awards, he drew criticism for his past use of homophobic slurs on Twitter. Early this morning he withdrew from the role. Grammy nominations: The rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake led the list of nominees announced today. The four major categories — record of the year, song of the year, album of the year and best new artist — are dominated by women. News quiz: Did you follow the headlines this week? Test yourself. Late-night comedy: Filling in for an ailing Trevor Noah, Desi Lydic noted that President Trump has employed undocumented immigrants: ""Trump told us he'd build a wall, but he never said there'd be a service entrance."" What we're reading: Anne-Sophie Bolon, an editor in London, recommends this piece from Longreads: ""The series 'Ugly History of Beautiful Things' turns to Angora rabbit wool, prized for its beauty, silky touch and warmth. The fiber was particularly popular in the 1930s and '40s with Hollywood stars, but also, it turns out, with Nazi officers."" Cook: A comforting dish of polenta topped with fried eggs. Listen to: Our critics' picks of the best pop music of the year. There are 65 songs to enjoy. Go to: The best performance of Handel's ""Messiah"" in New York City. (Hint: It's not at Lincoln Center.)

There have been many suggestions: the former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, the mathematician Alan Turing and the physicist Stephen Hawking. One lesser-known name caught our attention: Noor Inayat Khan, who spied for Britain during World War II. Ms. Khan wasn't what one would expect of a British spy. She was born a princess to Indian royalty, and she was a musician and a writer. But she spoke French and had excellent radio skills. She became the first female radio operator sent by Britain into occupied France. She did the work of six radio operators, moving constantly and dyeing her hair blond to avoid detection. Her work became crucial to the war effort. Ms. Khan never made it home; she was captured and executed at the Dachau concentration camp in 1944. She was 30. Read more about her here.

News,2018-12-07,Good Friday. Want this by email? Sign up here.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/business/dealbook/tech-ipo-uber-lyft.html,2009," Good Friday. Want this by email? Sign up here. Some of America's biggest privately held start-ups have resisted going public for years. That's about to change, and perhaps faster than we had thought it would. The news: Lyft, most recently valued at $15 billion, announced that it had confidentially filed a draft registration statement with the S.E.C. for an I.P.O. The ride-hailing company had indicated that it planned to go public in the middle of next year, but it is moving up the timing. Lyft's competitor Uber, which could be worth as much as $120 billion, is also moving its I.P.O. up from fall 2019. Why are they going public? ""For years, many unicorns were in no rush to go public because they could grow easily with money from private investors and away from the scrutiny of Wall Street,"" the NYT's Erin Griffith and Mike Isaac write. ""Those attitudes have shifted as investors and tech employees have increased pressure on the companies to go public so that they can cash in their shares."" Why the urgency now? Uber is said to be nervous about a looming recession. Lyft apparently pulled things forward because of the recent stock market sell-off (and because it wants to beat Uber to the punch). ""Few executives want to take their companies public when investors' appetite for shares may be ebbing,"" Ms. Griffith and Mr. Isaac write. Plus: Airbnb and Slack are also expected to go public next year, too, although the timing is unclear. On Saturday, Canadian police, acting at the request of the United States, detained Meng Wanzhou, the C.F.O. of the Chinese technology giant Huawei. The arrest came as President Trump was negotiating a trade truce with President Xi Jinping of China. More on why the arrest happened and what it means for the fragile trade truce between the U.S. and China from Mark Landler, Edward Wong and Katie Benner of the NYT: • ""The Justice Department is investigating Ms. Meng's company, Huawei, on charges of violating sanctions on Iran, and her arrest was meant as a warning shot by the Trump administration in its campaign to limit the global spread of Chinese technology."" • ""While the Justice Department did brief the White House about the impending arrest, Mr. Trump was not told about it. And the subject did not come up at the dinner with Mr. Xi."" • ""Former American officials said the awkward timing of it was most likely a coincidence that grew out of the unpredictable travel schedule of Ms. Meng."" • But ""the timing of the arrest, some experts said, could feed the suspicion of Chinese officials that nationalist factions in the Trump administration were trying to sabotage the trade deal."" President Trump got some good news yesterday: The U.S. exported more oil and fuel than it imported last week. That was the first time that had happened in 75 years. But that may have been outweighed by the monthly U.S. trade deficit hitting $55.5 billion in October, the highest monthly level in 10 years. Mr. Trump had pinned his hopes on oil and gas. Domestic production has been increasing, and the federal government lifted a ban in 2015 on crude oil exports, allowing American oil to flow outside its borders. That was supposed to help narrow the trade deficit. But the gap has continued to grow. ""The basic explanation is that the United States' appetite for foreign investment, including the financing of the federal debt, is driving the country's consumption of imports,"" write Binyamin Appelbaum and Jim Tankersley of the NYT. ""The dollars that the United States borrows from foreign countries are the dollars that the United States spends on foreign products."" The chairman of the failing retailer, which also owns Kmart, has offered to buy its remaining assets for $4.6 billion in a bid to prevent it from collapse. Here's how it would work. Mr. Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments, says it has put together the money from a mixture of cash, new loans and debt swaps. It would take over the entire company, including stores and brands like Kenmore. It would seek to keep the 500 or so stores that are still open and to preserve around 50,000 jobs. The deal would need to fend off bids that liquidators have prepared. So far, reactions have been negative. Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail advisory firm, told Bloomberg that Mr. Lambert was ""trying to perpetuate himself almost as an undertaker to drain more blood out of the body and make more money as he's doing it."" Farla Efros, the president of HRC Retail Advisory, said that the deal was ""really about ego and saving face."" OPEC ended a meeting yesterday without striking a deal to reduce oil output, writes Stanley Reed of the NYT. Officials discussed a range of cuts, with a reduction of a million barrels per day — or around 1 percent of global oil supply, a modest amount in the eyes of traders — thought to be enough to stabilize prices. The indecision reflects the different pressures facing the oil industry: • On one hand, the world is widely viewed as having an oil glut substantial enough to justify a cut in production, a move that would prop up prices. • But President Trump is pressing OPEC, and Saudi Arabia in particular, to maintain production levels to keep prices down for American consumers. Oil prices tumbled amid the failure to strike a deal. Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropped about 3.5 percent, to $59.40. There was little sign that things would improve when officials reconvene today. Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, told reporters he was ""not confident"" that an agreement that would keep supply and demand in balance was within reach. More natural resources news: The Trump administration plans to open nine million acres to drilling and mining by removing protections for the sage grouse, an imperiled ground-nesting bird. A steep slide followed by a strong recovery whipsawed investors on Thursday, write Alexandra Stevenson and Matt Phillips of the NYT. Here's what happened. A high-profile arrest raised trade worries. The arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the C.F.O. of Huawei, led investors to fear that the U.S.-China trade war could escalate rather than calm. The S&P 500 fell as much as 2.9 percent on the news, but regained much of the lost ground by day's end. Positive news about the Fed calmed investor jitters. The Wall Street Journal published an article saying that the central bank was considering emphasizing a wait-and-see approach to rate increases, offering traders some reassurance about future monetary policy. But one sector didn't bounce back. Energy shares were the worst-performing part of the S&P 500 yesterday, after prices for American crude oil fell when OPEC's meeting failed to yield a deal to reduce oil output. The relentless volatility is getting harder to explain. ""Markets have grown so jittery that moves seem detached from the fundamental or technical analysis that traders use to underpin investment decisions,"" write Vildana Hajric and Sarah Ponczek of Bloomberg. What if President Trump is correct and the Fed's interest rate increases are holding back the U.S. economy? It might depend on the starting point. Barry B. Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel, tells Peter Eavis of DealBook that the Fed's main policy rate, the federal funds rate, was in effect significantly lower in the years after the 2008 financial crisis than the actual rate. Call it the shadow rate. ""The economists Jing Cynthia Wu and Fan Dora Xia used the yields on government bonds to calculate a shadow fed funds rate. Their intent was to estimate what that rate would have been if it could have fallen below zero,"" Mr. Eavis writes. ""In the years after the crisis, this shadow rate fell as low as minus 3 percent in May 2014."" Why that matters now. ""The Fed has taken the fed funds rate from zero in 2015 to 2.25 percent today. But using the shadow rate, the Fed has effectively taken that rate from minus 3 percent in mid-2014 up to 2.25 percent today, a much greater increase, and one that might now be pressuring the economy."" A note of caution: From a growing G.D.P. to healthy loan issuance, there are still plenty of reasons to question whether monetary policy is really too stringent. Hannah Karp, a former reporter at The Wall Street Journal, has been appointed as the new editorial director at Billboard magazine. James Quincey, Coca-Cola's chief executive, will now also serve as its chairman. Tesla's general counsel, Todd Maron, is leaving the company. He will be succeeded by Dane Butswinkas, a Washington trial lawyer. Unilever's chief marketing officer, Keith Weed, will retire in May.

News,2018-12-07,"Shari Horne broke her toes a decade ago, and after surgery, “I have plates and pins and screws in my feet, and they get achy at times,” she said. ",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/health/seniors-marijuana-cannabis-pain.html,1147," Shari Horne broke her toes a decade ago, and after surgery, ""I have plates and pins and screws in my feet, and they get achy at times,"" she said.  So Ms. Horne, 66, applies a salve containing cannabidiol, derived from the cannabis, or marijuana, plant. It eases the pain.  The salve didn't help when she developed bursitis in her shoulder, but a tincture of cannabidiol mixed with T.H.C., the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, provided relief.  Using a pipe, she also smokes ""a few hits"" of a cannabis brand called Blue Dream after dinner, because ""I think relaxing is healthy for you."" Many of her neighbors in Laguna Woods, Calif., a community of mostly older adults in Orange County, where she serves on the City Council, have developed similar routines. ""People in their 80s and 90s, even retired Air Force colonels, are finding such relief"" with cannabis, said Ms. Horne. ""Almost everybody I know is using it in one form or another"" — including her husband Hal, 68, a retired insurance broker, who says it helps him sleep. In fact, so many Laguna Woods seniors use medical cannabis — for ailments ranging from arthritis and diabetes nerve pain to back injuries and insomnia — that the local dispensary, Bud and Bloom, charters a free bus to bring residents to its Santa Ana location to stock up on supplies. Along with a catered lunch, the bus riders get a seniors discount. Physicians who treat older adults expect their cannabis use to increase as the number of states legalizing medical marijuana keeps growing. After the midterm elections, when Utah and Missouri voters approved medical use, 33 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana, along with ten states that also have legalized recreational use.  Though the federal government still outlaws cannabis, classified as a Schedule I drug along with heroin (meaning that it has no therapeutic value), public support has swung sharply in favor of legalization, polls have found.  That support may rise as the baby boomers, often no strangers to marijuana, succeed their more leery parents as the oldest cohort. People aged 50 to 64 are more likely to report recent marijuana use than their elders. ""You might not like it,"" Dr. David Casarett, chief of palliative care at Duke University Medical Center, tells fellow physicians. ""You might not believe in it. But your patients are using this stuff."" He and Dr. Joshua Briscoe, a psychiatrist at Duke also trained in palliative care, have mixed feelings about that. Co-authors of a recent article on medical marijuana and older adults in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, they support legalization for medical use. They hope the federal government will reclassify cannabis (""a huge undertaking,"" Dr. Briscoe admitted), reducing obstacles to much-needed research. ""We're always searching for a better medication that can treat pain and a host of other symptoms without burdensome side effects, and cannabis is promising"" as a treatment for a number of conditions, Dr. Briscoe said. Their overview — along with a major report last year from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine — points out disorders for which cannabis does appear to have therapeutic effects. But the researchers are uneasy about the fact that older people essentially are undertaking self-treatment, with scant guidance from medical professionals. Cannabis consumers face a confusing array of options, including various strains and brands and many methods of ingestion: smoking, vaping, tinctures, edibles, topical creams or patches. Users can also experience potentially harmful side effects. When Joy Kavianian, 55, a Laguna Woods resident with Parkinson's disease, wanted to reduce her right-side tremors so that she could continue making ceramics, a cherished pursuit, she had lots of questions about cannabis. ""I didn't know how this would mix with my other meds,"" she said. ""How would it affect my sleep? The only answer was to slowly introduce it and see."" She has learned that a tincture, placed under her tongue about 40 minutes before she heads to the art studio, gives her four hours in which to work effectively. But that discovery took weeks of trial and error. ""The social support and legislation is outpacing the research,"" Dr. Briscoe said. ""If I want to say, 'Take this dose for this condition and that dose for that one' — the evidence just isn't there."" For older people, what does the still-limited evidence show? The strongest case, Dr. Casarett said, is that cannabis can reduce neuropathic pain, sometimes caused by diabetes, shingles or chemotherapy, without the toxic effects of opioids. Studies have also shown that cannabis alleviates the nausea and vomiting that often follows chemotherapy. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration has approved two synthetic T.H.C. drugs for that purpose, though some patients insist that smoking the real thing works better. Cannabis appears to relieve muscle spasms in people with multiple sclerosis, though that research is less extensive, and to improve appetite for patients with cancer or AIDS, Dr. Briscoe said. ""Plenty of patients swear it's the only thing that helps them sleep,"" he added. But while drowsiness often accompanies cannabis use, the evidence that it reliably improves sleep remains modest. Its effects on anxiety and depression are also unclear. And like any drug, cannabis has side effects, some of particular concern for older users, who metabolize medications differently from younger adults. Dizziness, for instance, can lead to injurious falls. Marijuana use is also associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle accidents, so Dr. Casarett and Dr. Briscoe advise counseling older patients not to drive for six to nine hours after use, depending on ingestion method. Moreover, ""the jury is very much out about long-term cognitive effects in adults,"" Dr. Casarett said. But there's no evidence that medical marijuana users are at increased risk of abusing the drug. Y. Tony Yang, a health services and policy researcher at George Washington University, recently predicted in a JAMA Neurology editorial that a June decision by the F.D.A. will have far-reaching consequences. The agency approved Epidiolex, the first C.B.D. prescription drug to be legally sold in the United States, for reducing seizures in rare adolescent forms of epilepsy.  ""A doctor can now prescribe this off-label for other uses, which is legal and common,"" Dr. Yang said. ""And on the research side, this could pave the way for controlled clinical trials for other purposes."" Insurers may balk at covering off-label use, he conceded. Medicare, for instance, doesn't cover medical cannabis, and it won't cover drugs used off-label. The bus riders from Laguna Woods often pay $100 to $200 a month out of pocket for cannabis products, a financial struggle for some. But riders like Catherine McCormick, who's 53, find it a worthwhile expenditure. To lessen pain after knee replacement surgery, she was relying on high doses of ibuprofen, ""too much wine"" and several prescription drugs, including oxycodone, benzodiazepines and an antidepressant.  She weaned herself from them all in a few months, she said, by smoking cannabis. That's made her a believer.  ""I have more energy. I can walk,"" she said. ""I'm not in pain. I feel so much better."""
News,2018-12-07,"WASHINGTON — Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, lied to federal investigators about his contacts with Trump administration officials and his interactions with a Russian linked to Moscow’s intelligence services, the special counsel’s office said on Friday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/us/politics/manafort-special-counsel-lies.html,1052," WASHINGTON — Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, lied to federal investigators about his contacts with Trump administration officials and his interactions with a Russian linked to Moscow's intelligence services, the special counsel's office said on Friday. He also lied about a $125,000 payment made through a political action committee to cover a debt he owed, prosecutors working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, said in a partly redacted court filing explaining why they withdrew last week from a plea agreement they had reached with Mr. Manafort in September. They also claimed he misled investigators pursuing a case unrelated to Mr. Mueller's investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential race and whether the Trump campaign conspired with the Kremlin's operations. ""Manafort told multiple discernible lies — these were not instances of mere memory lapses,"" the prosecutors wrote in a memo to Judge Amy Berman Jackson of United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The special counsel's office detailed its allegations that Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, lied to prosecutors. (PDF, 10 pages, 6.13 MB) The filing is a new example of Mr. Mueller's low tolerance for misstatements. Including Mr. Manafort, Mr. Mueller's team has accused five former aides to Mr. Trump of lying to them. When he agreed to plead guilty to two conspiracy charges and cooperate with prosecutors in September, Mr. Manafort, 69, had hoped that prosecutors would help him convince two federal judges that he merited a lighter punishment for his crimes. He faces at least 10 years in prison as a result of two prosecutions for charges ranging from bank fraud to conspiracy to obstruct justice and is expected to be sentenced early next year. [Inside the rise and fall of Paul Manafort: greed, deception and ego.] Though he had told prosecutors earlier that he had ""no direct or indirect communications"" with any Trump administration official while they were in government, Mr. Manafort had in fact kept in touch with a senior official through February 2018, prosecutors said. And three months later, in May, he authorized someone else to speak with a Trump appointee on his behalf, they wrote. They also detailed additional contacts with administration officials, citing a search of his documents. They did not identify the officials or detail the reasons for the contacts. Mr. Mueller's team has left open the possibility that it could file new charges of lying against Mr. Manafort. His lawyers say he believes he was honest during his interviews with the special counsel's office. The new documents were signed by Andrew Weissmann, a prosecutor known for his no-holds-barred approach who has become a favorite target of President Trump's. ""He wrongly destroyed people's lives,"" Mr. Trump declared of Mr. Weissmann earlier Friday on Twitter. The filing capped a busy week for Mr. Mueller's team. His office also filed a recommendation on Friday for the sentencing of Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former lawyer, alongside a scathing attack from prosecutors in Manhattan who rejected Mr. Cohen's request to avoid a prison term and accused him of using his power and influence ""for deceptive ends."" The prosecutors sought about four years in prison for Mr. Cohen when he is sentenced next week for lying to Congress about the extent of Mr. Trump's business dealings in Moscow, as well as for campaign finance violations and other charges. Convicted by a Northern Virginia jury in August of eight counts of financial fraud, Mr. Manafort agreed to a plea deal on the verge of a second trial. He met with the special counsel's office at least a dozen times before they declared that he had violated the plea agreement. Prosecutors have previously accused the Russian they say Mr. Manafort was in touch with, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, of ties to Russian intelligence. A Russian Army-trained linguist, Mr. Kilimnik served as Mr. Manafort's right-hand man in Ukraine for more than a decade, working on behalf of the country's Russia-aligned former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, his party and the oligarchs behind it. In Friday's filing, prosecutors blacked out much of the information related to Mr. Kilimnik but revealed that some of it had been uncovered in emails and testimony. They claimed that Mr. Manafort lied about various interactions and meetings with him, as well as about his involvement with witnesses who might testify against Mr. Manafort. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik remained in touch even after their business in Ukraine came to an end. After Mr. Manafort joined the Trump campaign in March 2016, the two men traded emails discussing how to use Mr. Manafort's position for financial gain. Mr. Kilimnik also traveled to the United States to meet with Mr. Manafort. This year, prosecutors have claimed, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik teamed up to try to persuade two witnesses to lie about the scope of the Ukraine work in order to protect Mr. Manafort. Both men were charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice, one of the felonies to which Mr. Manafort pleaded guilty in September. A Russian citizen, Mr. Kilimnik now lives in Moscow. Because Russia does not typically extradite its citizens, he is not expected to ever face trial in the United States. In a 2017 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Kilimnik denied that he had any connections to Russian intelligence. He described himself as ""a random casualty because of my proximity to Paul,"" referring to Mr. Manafort. The prosecutors also said Mr. Manafort misled them about the reason for the $125,000 wire transfer of funds in 2017 — claiming it was money owed to him as income or as repayment of a debt — and gave ""inconsistent statements"" about the source of the money. Associates of Mr. Manafort's said the money was funneled through a political action committee called Rebuilding America Now, set up in the summer of 2016 to help Mr. Trump's then-cash-starved campaign. Spending $23 million, it was one of the biggest sources of funds for polls and advertisements on Mr. Trump's behalf. Mr. Manafort, who then headed the Trump campaign, dispatched two longtime friends, Laurance Gay and Ken McKay, to run the operation. Neither could be reached for comment. Most of the committee's funds came from several big donors: Linda McMahon, a professional wrestling executive who donated $6 million and was appointed by Mr. Trump to head the Small Business Administration; Bernard Marcus, who co-founded Home Depot; and Geoffrey H. Palmer, a California real estate developer. Each gave $5 million."

This week began in Paris, however, with startlingly violent discord over fuel taxes stemming from that climate deal. The protesters, clad in the yellow safety vests France requires motorists to carry, are the most visible and extreme example of a backlash against taxes intended to save the world from a carbon-induced climate disaster. But they are far from unique in their opposition. Under President Trump, the United States has vowed to quit the Paris Agreement, and the country's deteriorating relationship with China has become a potential roadblock to global progress. [Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Sign up here.] In Canada, a meeting this week between the country's premiers and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was preceded by vocal opposition from the leaders of Ontario and Saskatchewan over plans to impose a federal carbon tax in their provinces. And as the world's environment ministers meet this month in Poland for follow-up talks on the Paris climate accord, many of the signatories — Canada included — remain far off-course on the goals of the agreement. As part of my reporting  on the carbon challenges ahead for Mr. Trudeau, I went to Saskatchewan, the epicenter of carbon tax opposition in Canada. During our meeting in Saskatchewan's legislative building, Scott Moe, the premier, repeatedly emphasized that despite his opposition to carbon pricing, the province isn't avoiding climate action. While the federal government and many environmentalists don't think its efforts are sufficient, no one is criticizing steps like replacing coal energy with natural gas, wind and solar power. Saskatchewan will also require companies that spew the most carbon to cut emissions by 5 to 15 percent. Mr. Moe is not a climate change denier. But he is flatly dismissive of the large body of work by economists showing that carbon pricing is an effective tool. ""I don't think it's fair to say, in any way, that it does work,"" he told me. Several of the ranchers and farmers I met, as well as some in southeastern Saskatchewan's energy industry, went further, wondering aloud whether Canada should do anything at all. They argued that any action from a country that accounts for about 1.6 percent of global emissions verges on the symbolic when China produces about 30 percent of the world's carbon dioxide. That case, however, ignores that China has already reached its carbon reduction commitment for 2020, a target many experts believe that Canada won't hit by the deadline. Andrew Scheer, the federal Conservative leader, has become as focused on eliminating carbon pricing as Mr. Trudeau has on introducing it. And while Canada is unlikely to see anything like the ""yellow vest"" violence of France, it's highly likely that the debate over carbon pricing will figure prominently in next year's federal vote.

Op-Ed,2018-12-08,"On Friday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the special counsel, Robert Mueller, delivered a potentially devastating one-two punch against President Trump. Coming late in the day, they made for bracing end-of-the-week reading.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/opinion/trump-collusion-cohen-manafort.html,862," On Friday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the special counsel, Robert Mueller, delivered a potentially devastating one-two punch against President Trump. Coming late in the day, they made for bracing end-of-the-week reading. Calling on the court to impose a sentence of substantial imprisonment against Michael Cohen, the president's former personal attorney, prosecutors in the Southern District of New York stated that Mr. Trump, the Trump Organization and the campaign were all directly involved in an illegal scheme to silence two women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Prosecutors wrote that payments made by Mr. Cohen and other actions were taken ""with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election"" and pursued ""in coordination with and at the direction of Individual 1"" — that is, Mr. Trump. The Trump Organization's reimbursements to Mr. Cohen for payments were fraudulently disguised as legal fees — and, according to the memo, were approved by senior executives at the organization. The New York prosecutors also disclosed that they are investigating additional unspecified matters involving Mr. Cohen and, presumably, the Trump Organization. In light of these disclosures, the likelihood that the company and the Trump campaign face charges is now high.  Although President Trump may avoid a similar fate because the Justice Department is unlikely to indict a sitting president, he could be named as an unindicted co-conspirator, as was President Richard Nixon, or charged if he leaves office before the statute of limitations runs out (most likely in 2022). In crediting Mr. Cohen with providing ""substantial and significant efforts"" to assist the investigation, Mr. Mueller's separate sentencing memo details new evidence of collusion with Russia, including a previously unreported phone conversation in November 2015 between Mr. Cohen and an unnamed Russian who claimed to be a ""trusted person"" in Moscow. The Russian explained to Mr. Cohen how the Russian government could provide the Trump campaign with ""political synergy"" and ""synergy on a government level,"" and offered to set up a meeting between Mr. Trump, then a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.  This newly disclosed conversation directly speaks to the question of collusion — the outreach was explicitly political and was focused on how each side would gain from a potential partnership. Mr. Mueller also notes that Mr. Cohen provided his team with additional information relevant to the ""core"" of the special counsel investigation.  The special counsel focuses on Mr. Cohen's contacts with people connected to the White House in 2017 and 2018, possibly further implicating the president and others in his orbit in conspiracy to obstruct justice or to suborn perjury. Mr. Mueller specifically mentions that Mr. Cohen provided invaluable insight into the ""preparing and circulating"" of his testimony to Congress — and if others, including the president, knew about the false testimony or encouraged it in any way, they would be at substantial legal risk. Mr. Trump's legal woes do not end there. The special counsel also advanced the president's potential exposure under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for activities relating to a potential Trump Tower Moscow. Mr. Mueller noted that the Moscow project was a lucrative business opportunity that actively sought Russian government approval, and that the unnamed Russian told Mr. Cohen that there was ""no bigger warranty in any project than the consent"" of Mr. Putin.  If recent reports that Mr. Cohen floated the idea of giving Mr. Putin a $50 million luxury apartment in a future Trump Tower Moscow prove true, both the president and his company could face substantial jeopardy. In a second blow to the president, on Friday prosecutors also disclosed a list of false statements that Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, allegedly made to federal investigators in breach of the cooperation agreement he entered into following his conviction for financial fraud and subsequent guilty plea to criminal conspiracy. Some of the lies that the special counsel spells out in the redacted memorandum appear to implicate the president and those close to him in possible collusion and obstruction crimes. Notably, Mr. Manafort is accused of lying to the special counsel regarding his contacts with the Trump administration.  We don't know the content of those contacts, but considering public statements about potential pardons, it is not hard to imagine they could implicate the president and others in a conspiracy to obstruct justice or witness tampering if, for example, they suggested a potential pardon if Mr. Manafort protected the president.  Contrary to the president's claim that all of this ""totally clears"" him, the danger to Mr. Trump, his business and his campaign has compounded significantly. For all these reasons, the president is unlikely to have a restful, tweet-free weekend — or a calm 2019, for that matter.

News,2018-12-08,"At a dorm movie night, he might find sandwiches. At an open mic, it could be a few boxes of pizza.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/neediest-cases/taking-college-one-meal-at-a-time.html,862," At a dorm movie night, he might find sandwiches. At an open mic, it could be a few boxes of pizza. Other Cornell students might see free food at campus events as a bonus. But for Samuel Issiah Williams, it is often dinner. Mr. Williams, 22, is a Cornell senior majoring in information science. He arrived on campus this semester facing rising tuition costs, unexpected health insurance fees and thousands of dollars in loans. Rather than add to his mounting debt, he decided to forgo a meal plan — thousands of dollars for the year — and instead make do with canned goods and freebies around campus. ""This is what I have to do to save money,"" he said last month at his parents' home in Jamaica, Queens. ""That's how it's going to be."" Through Children's Aid, one of the eight agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, Mr. Williams got help for the fall semester, receiving $652.85 from the fund for meals and textbooks. He hopes to stay steadily nourished until May, when he graduates and plans to get a job in web design. Born in the tropical South American country of Guyana, Mr. Williams still has not quite gotten used to the snow on Cornell's campus in Ithaca, N.Y. He grew up in Guyana's capital, Georgetown, where mango, guava and cashew trees grew in his backyard. His parents made and sold hats from a vendor's stand downtown, but they wanted better economic and educational opportunities for their five children. With his family, Mr. Williams immigrated to the United States in 2008 in the midst of the recession. Settling down in Brooklyn, they joined other family members in a two-bedroom apartment that now housed 13. Mr. Williams slept next to his cousin on a bottom bunk, while his two brothers shared the top. ""We slept fine,"" he said. ""It wasn't something we thought about that much."" Still, those early years in the United States were difficult for the Williams family. In their second Brooklyn apartment, they contended with difficult neighbors, and one night, Mr. Williams's father was mugged and had to stay home for a week tending to his injuries. ""We didn't feel safe there,"" Mr. Williams said. ""That was the worst experience."" While his parents worked low-wage service jobs in the city, they instilled in their children a tireless academic work ethic. Mr. Williams became a standout student at Benjamin Banneker Academy, excelling particularly in math and English. He tutored math after school, earned scholarships to help pay for college and graduated on the honor roll. Several prestigious colleges accepted him, but ""I had to look at the financial aid package to determine if I would be able to go or not,"" he said. The initial package that Cornell offered in 2015 seemed like a dream come true: The university covered all first-year costs except for a student contribution fee. Tuition costs rose each year, though, and so did the contribution fees for Mr. Williams and his parents. A $350 student health fee, which caused an uproar on campus, was also put into effect. And a policy change required over 2,000 students, including Mr. Williams, to spend about $2,800 on the school's health insurance this year. His application for a waiver, relying on his mother's insurance plan, was denied. (Cornell has changed the policy to allow more students to waive the school plan for the next calendar year.) So Mr. Williams turned to loans and money from his parents to stay afloat. He also works at a laboratory on campus, where he cleans up after experiments — but he has little time to earn additional money, given the coursework for his five classes this semester. After class, he cooks simple meals for himself. His favorite childhood foods — like Guyanese cook-up rice — are too challenging and expensive to make, so he often relies on pasta, canned beans and chicken tenders. He watches a GroupMe message channel on campus that points students to free food and shows up to those events. ""I always find a way,"" he said. Mr. Williams says that he does not often talk about his financial struggles with his classmates. But hunger is a pervasive problem across college campuses, affecting millions of students, according to a survey released this year by Temple University and the Wisconsin HOPE Lab. Of the 43,000 students at 66 colleges surveyed, 36 percent had trouble getting enough to eat on a daily basis. For Mr. Williams, his student loans are a constant source of anxiety. ""In the back of my mind, I'm always telling myself, 'Once you graduate, all this money's going to accumulate. You're going to be in debt,'"" he said. After graduation, Mr. Williams plans to earn an internship or job in front-end software or web design. He is interested in designing apps and also has aspirations to publish his poetry and short stories. His ultimate goal is to be his own boss, so that he does not have to rely on anyone except for himself. ""At some point in my life, I hope to be self-employed,"" he said. ""I can't imagine myself working for someone else my entire life."" Donations to the Neediest Cases may be made online, or with a check or over the phone."
News,2018-12-08,Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is not shy about sharing his taste for chocolate milk.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/us/trump-school-lunch-usda.html,806," Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is not shy about sharing his taste for chocolate milk. ""I wouldn't be as big as I am today without chocolate milk,"" Mr. Perdue told reporters in May 2017, while discussing his plan to relax Obama-era school lunch rules. It was one of his first days on the job. This week, the United States Department of Agriculture announced its final plans to lower nutrition standards for grains, flavored milks and sodium in school cafeterias that were part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and that Michelle Obama, the former first lady, had advocated. The changes, all of which will go into effect by July, apply to school meals that qualify for at least some federal reimbursement. They may seem relatively minor on paper, but like many Trump administration moves to reverse Obama-era policies, they come with some controversy. First, the grains: The Obama-era rules required that schools must serve entirely ""whole grain-rich"" foods, meaning that the product — whether it is pizza, pasta or hamburger buns — must contain at least 50 percent whole grains. Under the new rules, only half of the grain products on the cafeteria's weekly menu must be whole grain-rich. Theoretically, that means schools could serve all whole grain-rich food three days a week and food made with refined grains the other two days. The Trump administration asserts in the new rules that administrators have struggled to find food products that meet these standards while also pleasing students. Schools have been able to request exemptions from the rules if they demonstrate financial hardship, and the government has said the most popular requests have been for regional staples like grits in the South and tortillas in the Southwest. But the current administration asserted that the exemptions process was not sustainable and that some schools found it too burdensome. Not all food service administrators have problems with the current rules. Ann Cooper, the food service director for Boulder Valley Schools, in Colorado, said the district served only whole grain-rich foods and never received complaints. It is hard for many students to even tell when foods like tortillas are made with some whole grain flour, said Ms. Cooper, who is also the president of the Chef Ann Foundation, which provides grants to help schools serve healthier food. ""It's not like in the 1960s when whole grain was like eating a hockey puck,"" she said. ""Do we really need more white bread in our schools?"" As for the milk, the Trump administration is allowing schools to serve low-fat flavored milks, rather than just the nonfat version. This change was already in place for this school year, but Thursday's announcement made it permanent. The rationale, according to the new rules, is to make sure children keep up their milk consumption. ""The kids told me that the flavored milk, which was limited to nonfat, was not as tasty as they would like,"" Mr. Perdue said at the May 2017 news conference. To back up the rule change, the Agriculture Department cited its own study concluding that milk consumption per person had decreased from 2000 to 2016, though the data is not specific to children. Miguel Villarreal, director of food and nutritional services for the Novato Unified School District in Northern California, said the district had chosen not to serve flavored milk at its schools at all because of the sugar content. ""It's like giving them a can of soda,"" he said. Mr. Villarreal said when flavored milk was removed from the menu, milk consumption did drop temporarily until students became accustomed to the unflavored version. ""If I can educate the kids to drink nonflavored milk, then we're doing a service for those kids,"" he said. The Trump administration's new sodium rules are less polarizing. Schools will still have to reduce sodium in lunches, but they will not be required to do so as aggressively. The School Nutrition Association, an advocacy organization that represents school-food professionals, cheered the new regulations in a news release on Thursday, praising the Trump administration for its flexibility with the standards. The group counts many of the country's largest food companies among its backers. Karen Perry Stillerman, a senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said it was unclear why the Trump administration would backtrack when schools were in good standing with the nutritional goals. A 2016 news release from the U.S.D.A. said that more than 99 percent of schools in the country reported that they were meeting the Obama-era standards. Ms. Stillerman said she would prefer that the government offer extra help to schools that were not meeting the nutritional requirements rather than lowering the standards across the country. ""It seems like a small thing,"" she said. ""But the behavioral research shows you have to offer nutritious food to kids over and over and be consistent."""

The Rev. Ross Lang, a Presbyterian minister, officiated, with Msgr. John J. Carroll taking part in a ceremony that incorporated both Presbyterian and Catholic wedding traditions. The bride, 35, works in the investor relations department at Bain Capital in New York. She graduated from New England College in Henniker, N.H. She is a daughter of Cyndi Webb of Mountain Lakes, and the late Bill Webb. The bride's father was a Major League Baseball television sports director for both Fox Sports and New York Mets telecasts on SNY. He directed 17 World Series, 18 All-Star Games and many other significant sports events, including the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. He also won dozens of Emmy Awards as part of various broadcast teams throughout his career, and seven individual Emmys. In 2016, he was elected to the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. Mr. McCarthy, who is 40 and works in Billings, Mont., is an assistant United States attorney for the District of Montana. He graduated from Notre Dame, from which he also received a law degree. He is a son of Carolyn S. McCarthy and G. Daniel McCarthy of Scottsdale, Ariz. The groom's father retired as a partner in Gibbons, a law firm in Newark. He was previously general counsel of the Hewlett-Packard Financial Services Company in Murray Hill, N.J. Ms. Webb and Mr. McCarthy first met in March 2017 during a ski trip in Big Sky, Mont. ""There was just something so captivating about him,"" Ms. Webb said. ""He was super-funny and charismatic, and a gentleman in an old-school kind of way, which reminded me of my dad."" Two weeks after they met, Mr. McCarthy went on a business trip to Columbia, S.C., and arranged to meet Ms. Webb for a long weekend in Charleston, about two hours away. ""She was smart and beautiful and someone who made me laugh so easily,"" said Mr. McCarthy, who grew up in Chatham, N.J. ""Though I felt she was completely out of my league, I thought 'Well, let me at least give this thing a shot.'"" After exploring Charleston together, they had dinner at a local bistro and decided to continue seeing each other despite the fact that they were living on opposite sides of the country, she in Boston and he in Billings. ""Talking with her was so easy, it was as if she was someone I had known my whole life,"" Mr. McCarthy said. ""We also have a lot in common given the fact that we grew up not far from each other in New Jersey."" Ms. Webb said she is looking forward to the day when she and Mr. McCarthy can eliminate the distance between them. ""It's been about two years since we've been going back and forth to see each other,"" she said, ""but I'm anxious to begin living with Brendan and starting a family together."""
News,2018-12-08,"This article was reported and written in collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit journalism organization.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/health/medical-journals-conflicts-of-interest.html,2001," This article was reported and written in collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit journalism organization. One is dean of Yale's medical school. Another is the director of a cancer center in Texas. A third is the next president of the most prominent society of cancer doctors. These leading medical figures are among dozens of doctors who have failed in recent years to report their financial relationships with pharmaceutical and health care companies when their studies are published in medical journals, according to a review by The New York Times and ProPublica and data from other recent research. Dr. Howard A. ""Skip"" Burris III, the president-elect of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, for instance, declared that he had no conflicts of interest in more than 50 journal articles in recent years, including in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. However, drug companies have paid his employer nearly $114,000 for consulting and speaking, and nearly $8 million for his research during the period for which disclosure was required. His omissions extended to the Journal of Clinical Oncology, which is published by the group he will lead. In addition to the widespread lapses by doctors, the review by The Times and ProPublica found that journals themselves often gave confusing advice and did not routinely vet disclosures by researchers, although many relationships could have been easily detected on a federal database. Medical journals, which are the main conduit for communicating the latest scientific discoveries to the public, often have an interdependent relationship with the researchers who publish in their pages. Reporting a study in a leading journal can heighten their profile — not to mention that of the drug or other product being tested. And journals enhance their cachet by publishing exclusive, breakthrough studies by acclaimed researchers. In all, the reporting system still appears to have many of the same flaws that the Institute of Medicine identified nearly a decade ago when it recommended fundamental changes in how conflicts of interest are reported. Those have yet to happen. A review by The New York Times and ProPublica found that dozens of doctors have failed to disclose significant conflicts of interests in their journal papers. ""The system is broken,"" said Dr. Mehraneh Dorna Jafari, an assistant professor of surgery at the University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine. She and her colleagues  published a study in August that found that, of the 100 doctors who received the most compensation from device makers in 2015, conflicts were disclosed in only 37 percent of the articles published in the next year. ""The journals aren't checking and the rules are different for every single thing."" Calls for transparency stem from concerns that researchers' ties to the health and drug industries increase the odds they will, consciously or not, skew results to favor the companies with whom they do business. Studies have found that industry-sponsored research tends to be more positive than research financed by other sources. And that in turn can sway which treatments become available to patients. There is no indication that the research done by Dr. Burris and the other doctors with incomplete disclosures was manipulated or falsified. Journal editors say they are introducing changes that will better standardize disclosures and reduce errors. But some have also argued that since most researchers follow the rules, stringent new requirements would be costly and unnecessary. The issue has gained traction since September, when Dr. José Baselga, who was the chief medical officer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, resigned after The Times and ProPublica reported that he had not revealed his industry ties in dozens of journal articles. [Read more about doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering and their financial relationships with companies.] Dr. Burris, president of clinical operations and chief medical officer at the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, referred questions about the payments to his employer. It defended him, saying the payments were made to the institution, although The New England Journal of Medicine requires disclosure of all such payments. Other prominent researchers who have submitted erroneous disclosures include Dr. Robert J. Alpern, the dean of the Yale School of Medicine, who failed to disclose in a 2017 journal article about an experimental treatment developed by Tricida that he served on that company's board of directors and owned its stock. Tricida, which is developing therapies for chronic kidney disease, had financed the clinical trial that was the subject of the article. Dr. Alpern said in an email that he initially believed that his disclosure — that he had been a consultant for Tricida — was adequate. However, ""because of concerns recently raised about disclosures,"" he said he notified the publication, The Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, in October that he also served on Tricida's board and had stock holdings in the company. The journal initially told Dr. Alpern that his disclosure was sufficient. But after The Times and ProPublica contacted the publication in November, it said it would correct the article. ""The failure to disclose this information at the time of peer review is a violation of our policy,"" Dr. Rajnish Mehrotra, the journal's editor in chief, said in an email. He later said that an additional inquiry had revealed that all 12 of the article's authors had submitted incomplete disclosures, and that the journal planned to refer the matter to the ethics committee of the American Society of Nephrology. Dr. Mehrotra also said that the journal had decided to conduct an audit of some recent articles to evaluate the broader issue. Dr. Carlos L. Arteaga, the director of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center in Dallas, said he had ""nothing to disclose"" as an author of a 2016 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine of the breast cancer drug Kisqali, made by Novartis. But Dr. Arteaga had received more than $50,000 from drug companies in the three-year disclosure period, including more than $14,000 from Novartis. In an email, Dr. Arteaga described the omission as an ""inexcusable oversight and error on my part,"" and subsequently submitted a correction. Dr. Jeffrey R. Botkin, an associate vice president for research at the University of Utah, recently argued in JAMA, a leading medical journal, that researchers should face misconduct charges when they do not disclose their relationships with interested companies. ""They really are falsifying the information that others rely on to assess that research,"" he said. ""Money is a very powerful influencer, and people's opinions become subtly biased by that financial relationship."" But Dr. Howard C. Bauchner, the editor in chief of JAMA, said that verifying each author's disclosures would not be worth the time or effort. ""The vast majority of authors are honest and do want to fulfill their obligations to tell readers and editors what their conflicts of interest could be,"" he said in an interview. As the debate continues, an influential group, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, is considering a policy that would refer researchers who commit major disclosure errors to their institutions for possible charges of research misconduct. Concerns about the influence of drug companies on medical research have persisted for decades. Senator Estes Kefauver held hearings on the issue in 1959, and there was another surge of concern in the 2000s after a series of scandals in which prominent doctors failed to reveal their industry relationships. Medical journals and professional societies strengthened their requirements. The drug industry restricted how it compensates doctors, prohibiting gifts like tickets to sporting events or luxury trips — although evidence of kickbacks and corruption continues to surface in criminal prosecutions. And a 2010 federal law required pharmaceutical and device makers to publicly report their payments to physicians. Despite these changes, the system for disclosing conflicts remains fragmented and weakly enforced. Medical journals and professional societies have a variety of guidelines about what types of relationships must be reported, often leaving it up to the researcher to decide what is relevant. There are few repercussions — beyond a correction — for those who fail to follow the rules. For example, the American Association for Cancer Research has warned authors that they face a three-year ban if they are found to have omitted a potential conflict. But the group's policy on conflicts of interest contains no mention of such a penalty, and it said no author had ever been barred. Dr. Baselga's failure to disclose his industry relationships extended to the association's journal, Cancer Discovery, for which he serves as one of two editors in chief. The association said it is investigating Dr. Baselga's actions. Most authors do seem to disclose their ties to corporate interests. About two-thirds of the authors on the Kisqali study, for example, reported relationships with companies, including Novartis. But the researchers who did not included Dr. Arteaga, Dr. Burris and Dr. Denise A. Yardley, a senior investigator who works with Dr. Burris at Sarah Cannon. The Tennessee-based research center received more than $105,000 in fees for consulting, speaking and other services on Dr. Yardley's behalf in the three-year period in which she declared no conflicts. The Sarah Cannon institute said it switched over a year ago to a ""universal disclosure"" practice promoted by ASCO, the cancer group that Dr. Burris will lead. That requires doctors to disclose all payments, including those made to their institutions. ""We believe we adhere to the highest ethical standards in the industry by not allowing personal compensation to be paid to our leadership physicians,"" the center said. ASCO said it would post corrections to Dr. Burris's disclosures in The Journal of Clinical Oncology for the past four years. The group said that in the fall of 2017 — as Dr. Burris was seeking a leadership role in the organization — it began working with him to disclose all his company relationships, including indirect payments. Dr. Burris will become president in June 2019. ""Disclosure systems and processes in medicine are not perfect yet, and neither are ASCO's,"" the group said in an email. Dr. Burris, Dr. Yardley and Dr. Arteaga submitted updated disclosures to The New England Journal of Medicine, which posted them on Thursday. Dr. Burris's updated disclosure listed relationships with 30 companies, including that he provided expert testimony for Novartis. Other studies recently published by the New England Journal of Medicine also omitted disclosures, including one on a 2018 study on a treatment for sickle cell disease and another on the recently approved cancer drug Vitravki, to be sold by Bayer and Loxo Oncology. Jennifer Zeis, a spokeswoman for the journal, said that it was contacting those studies' authors, and that it now asked researchers to certify that they had checked their disclosures against the federal database. Some institutions have pushed back, arguing that the journals' inconsistent rules make it difficult for even well-meaning researchers to do the right thing. In a letter last month To the New England Journal of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering objected to the treatment of one of its top researchers, Dr. Jedd Wolchok. When he tried to correct his disclosures, the journal shifted its position, from saying its editors were satisfied with his disclosures to saying he had failed to comply with the rules, the center said in citing communications with the journal. Dr. Wolchok, a pioneer in cancer immunotherapy, ultimately corrected 13 articles and letters to the editor. To clarify reporting requirements, several publications are attempting only now to do what the Institute of Medicine recommended in 2009. The New England Journal is testing a new system in partnership with the Association of American Medical Colleges that would act as a central repository for reporting financial relationships. This year, JAMA began requiring authors to confirm multiple times that they had nothing to disclose. ASCO has a centralized system for reporting conflicts to all of its journals and speaker presentations. Dr. Bernard Lo, the chairman of the 2009 Institute of Medicine panel, said journals have only begun to confront some of the systemic flaws. ""They're certainly not out in front trying to be trailblazers, let me just say it that way,"" he said. ""The fact that it hasn't been done means that nobody has it on their priority list."""
Interactive Feature,2018-12-08,A review by The New York Times and ProPublica found that dozens of doctors have failed to disclose significant conflicts of interests in their journal papers.,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/08/health/journal-conflicts-of-interest.html,0," This article was reported and written in collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit journalism organization. One is dean of Yale's medical school. Another is the director of a cancer center in Texas. A third is the next president of the most prominent society of cancer doctors. These leading medical figures are among dozens of doctors who have failed in recent years to report their financial relationships with pharmaceutical and health care companies when their studies are published in medical journals, according to a review by The New York Times and ProPublica and data from other recent research. Dr. Howard A. ""Skip"" Burris III, the president-elect of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, for instance, declared that he had no conflicts of interest in more than 50 journal articles in recent years, including in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. However, drug companies have paid his employer nearly $114,000 for consulting and speaking, and nearly $8 million for his research during the period for which disclosure was required. His omissions extended to the Journal of Clinical Oncology, which is published by the group he will lead. In addition to the widespread lapses by doctors, the review by The Times and ProPublica found that journals themselves often gave confusing advice and did not routinely vet disclosures by researchers, although many relationships could have been easily detected on a federal database. Medical journals, which are the main conduit for communicating the latest scientific discoveries to the public, often have an interdependent relationship with the researchers who publish in their pages. Reporting a study in a leading journal can heighten their profile — not to mention that of the drug or other product being tested. And journals enhance their cachet by publishing exclusive, breakthrough studies by acclaimed researchers. In all, the reporting system still appears to have many of the same flaws that the Institute of Medicine identified nearly a decade ago when it recommended fundamental changes in how conflicts of interest are reported. Those have yet to happen. A review by The New York Times and ProPublica found that dozens of doctors have failed to disclose significant conflicts of interests in their journal papers. ""The system is broken,"" said Dr. Mehraneh Dorna Jafari, an assistant professor of surgery at the University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine. She and her colleagues  published a study in August that found that, of the 100 doctors who received the most compensation from device makers in 2015, conflicts were disclosed in only 37 percent of the articles published in the next year. ""The journals aren't checking and the rules are different for every single thing."" Calls for transparency stem from concerns that researchers' ties to the health and drug industries increase the odds they will, consciously or not, skew results to favor the companies with whom they do business. Studies have found that industry-sponsored research tends to be more positive than research financed by other sources. And that in turn can sway which treatments become available to patients. There is no indication that the research done by Dr. Burris and the other doctors with incomplete disclosures was manipulated or falsified. Journal editors say they are introducing changes that will better standardize disclosures and reduce errors. But some have also argued that since most researchers follow the rules, stringent new requirements would be costly and unnecessary. The issue has gained traction since September, when Dr. José Baselga, who was the chief medical officer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, resigned after The Times and ProPublica reported that he had not revealed his industry ties in dozens of journal articles. [Read more about doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering and their financial relationships with companies.] Dr. Burris, president of clinical operations and chief medical officer at the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, referred questions about the payments to his employer. It defended him, saying the payments were made to the institution, although The New England Journal of Medicine requires disclosure of all such payments. Other prominent researchers who have submitted erroneous disclosures include Dr. Robert J. Alpern, the dean of the Yale School of Medicine, who failed to disclose in a 2017 journal article about an experimental treatment developed by Tricida that he served on that company's board of directors and owned its stock. Tricida, which is developing therapies for chronic kidney disease, had financed the clinical trial that was the subject of the article. Dr. Alpern said in an email that he initially believed that his disclosure — that he had been a consultant for Tricida — was adequate. However, ""because of concerns recently raised about disclosures,"" he said he notified the publication, The Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, in October that he also served on Tricida's board and had stock holdings in the company. The journal initially told Dr. Alpern that his disclosure was sufficient. But after The Times and ProPublica contacted the publication in November, it said it would correct the article. ""The failure to disclose this information at the time of peer review is a violation of our policy,"" Dr. Rajnish Mehrotra, the journal's editor in chief, said in an email. He later said that an additional inquiry had revealed that all 12 of the article's authors had submitted incomplete disclosures, and that the journal planned to refer the matter to the ethics committee of the American Society of Nephrology. Dr. Mehrotra also said that the journal had decided to conduct an audit of some recent articles to evaluate the broader issue. Dr. Carlos L. Arteaga, the director of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center in Dallas, said he had ""nothing to disclose"" as an author of a 2016 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine of the breast cancer drug Kisqali, made by Novartis. But Dr. Arteaga had received more than $50,000 from drug companies in the three-year disclosure period, including more than $14,000 from Novartis. In an email, Dr. Arteaga described the omission as an ""inexcusable oversight and error on my part,"" and subsequently submitted a correction. Dr. Jeffrey R. Botkin, an associate vice president for research at the University of Utah, recently argued in JAMA, a leading medical journal, that researchers should face misconduct charges when they do not disclose their relationships with interested companies. ""They really are falsifying the information that others rely on to assess that research,"" he said. ""Money is a very powerful influencer, and people's opinions become subtly biased by that financial relationship."" But Dr. Howard C. Bauchner, the editor in chief of JAMA, said that verifying each author's disclosures would not be worth the time or effort. ""The vast majority of authors are honest and do want to fulfill their obligations to tell readers and editors what their conflicts of interest could be,"" he said in an interview. As the debate continues, an influential group, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, is considering a policy that would refer researchers who commit major disclosure errors to their institutions for possible charges of research misconduct. Concerns about the influence of drug companies on medical research have persisted for decades. Senator Estes Kefauver held hearings on the issue in 1959, and there was another surge of concern in the 2000s after a series of scandals in which prominent doctors failed to reveal their industry relationships. Medical journals and professional societies strengthened their requirements. The drug industry restricted how it compensates doctors, prohibiting gifts like tickets to sporting events or luxury trips — although evidence of kickbacks and corruption continues to surface in criminal prosecutions. And a 2010 federal law required pharmaceutical and device makers to publicly report their payments to physicians. Despite these changes, the system for disclosing conflicts remains fragmented and weakly enforced. Medical journals and professional societies have a variety of guidelines about what types of relationships must be reported, often leaving it up to the researcher to decide what is relevant. There are few repercussions — beyond a correction — for those who fail to follow the rules. For example, the American Association for Cancer Research has warned authors that they face a three-year ban if they are found to have omitted a potential conflict. But the group's policy on conflicts of interest contains no mention of such a penalty, and it said no author had ever been barred. Dr. Baselga's failure to disclose his industry relationships extended to the association's journal, Cancer Discovery, for which he serves as one of two editors in chief. The association said it is investigating Dr. Baselga's actions. Most authors do seem to disclose their ties to corporate interests. About two-thirds of the authors on the Kisqali study, for example, reported relationships with companies, including Novartis. But the researchers who did not included Dr. Arteaga, Dr. Burris and Dr. Denise A. Yardley, a senior investigator who works with Dr. Burris at Sarah Cannon. The Tennessee-based research center received more than $105,000 in fees for consulting, speaking and other services on Dr. Yardley's behalf in the three-year period in which she declared no conflicts. The Sarah Cannon institute said it switched over a year ago to a ""universal disclosure"" practice promoted by ASCO, the cancer group that Dr. Burris will lead. That requires doctors to disclose all payments, including those made to their institutions. ""We believe we adhere to the highest ethical standards in the industry by not allowing personal compensation to be paid to our leadership physicians,"" the center said. ASCO said it would post corrections to Dr. Burris's disclosures in The Journal of Clinical Oncology for the past four years. The group said that in the fall of 2017 — as Dr. Burris was seeking a leadership role in the organization — it began working with him to disclose all his company relationships, including indirect payments. Dr. Burris will become president in June 2019. ""Disclosure systems and processes in medicine are not perfect yet, and neither are ASCO's,"" the group said in an email.

Op-Ed,2018-12-08,"You’d agree, wouldn’t you, that Consideration No. 1 in choosing a Democratic nominee in 2020 is making sure that he or she is the person best positioned to defeat Donald Trump? That nothing else comes close?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/opinion/sunday/biden-2020-dont-run.html,1241," You'd agree, wouldn't you, that Consideration No. 1 in choosing a Democratic nominee in 2020 is making sure that he or she is the person best positioned to defeat Donald Trump? That nothing else comes close? Then what would you say if I told you that we should put our chips on a man who failed miserably at two previous campaigns for the nomination, the first one all the way back in 1988, a year before Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was born? And that when he applied the lessons from that debacle to his second bid two decades later, he did no better, placing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, getting fewer than 1 percent of the state's delegates and folding his tent before even the New Hampshire primary? And that he spent nearly 45 years in Washington, a proper noun that's a dirty word in presidential politics? And that his record includes laws and episodes that are reviled — rightly — by the female and black voters so integral to the Democratic Party? And that, on Election Day, he would be 77, which is 31 years older than Bill Clinton was in 1992, 30 years older than Barack Obama was in 2008 and a complete contradiction of the party's success over the last half-century with relatively youthful candidates? You'd tell me that I was of unsound mind. Well, Joe Biden's boosters are. Right now there's a swell of talk about, and interest in, a Biden candidacy. Last Monday he told an audience in Montana that none of the other Democrats eyeing the White House were as qualified as he is, and it sounded like the beginnings of a stump speech. A terrible stump speech at that. If what Biden took away from the 2016 election was that qualifications rule the day, I'd urge him to ask Hillary Clinton how consoling her impeccable credentials are and then to educate me on the gold-plated wonders of Trump's C.V. A national poll two weeks ago showed that Biden was far ahead of other Democrats in a hypothetical primary field, winning the favor of 25 percent of respondents in comparison with 15 percent for Bernie Sanders, 13 for Hillary Clinton, 9 for Beto O'Rourke and under 5 each for Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris. But that's name recognition multiplied by nostalgia. And nostalgia is a risky currency and an odd fit for a party that last claimed the White House with a mantra of hope and change. An article about Biden that The Atlantic published on Thursday said that ""people keep coming up to him everywhere he goes"" to profess their longing and love. It quoted one 89-year-old woman who told Biden: ""If you promise to run, I'll promise to stay alive long enough to vote for you."" She clearly admires him very much. I do, too. He's an admirable person. How I wish that mattered more in terms of the outcome of a presidential election than it obviously does. He pressed on with public service long after he could have cashed in. His devotion to his family is palpable; his strength through its tragedies, extraordinary. He's informed, he's affable and he's real. But is he the best bet? The difference between four and eight years of Trump could be everything; this is a time for ruthlessly unemotional calculation. Show me persuasive evidence that the president's most fearsome adversary is an avocado and I'll whip up the corresponding paraphernalia: Make America Guac Again. And you know what? By the time 2020 rolls around, perhaps an avocado could beat Trump. We await Robert Mueller's report while being reminded daily of how staggeringly thorough his inquiry has been. We could be on the cusp of a recession. Even amid strong economic indicators, voters issued a clear repudiation of Trump in the midterm elections, as the Democrats picked up at least 40 House seats.  But we should plan for a worst-case scenario — for a Trump who's wounded but not critically or who has managed to hit some kind of herky-jerky homestretch stride. We should be cleareyed about each Democratic contender's shortcomings and vulnerabilities. Biden, who followed 36 years as a senator from Delaware with eight as Obama's vice president, has many. His record is one of them. There's prodigious accomplishment there but also trouble: his stern treatment of Anita Hill when she appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which he was chairman; his role as an ambassador for the financial services industry in Delaware; his key part in the passage of crime bills that ended up punishing African-Americans disproportionately. None of that jibes with his party's current priorities and mood. The very scope of that record isn't ideal. ""It would be so nice, after Hillary, to have someone without years and years of votes and baggage,"" one Democratic strategist told me. Biden's long history, she added, ""is a treasure trove for any opponent."" Then there's Biden's famous propensity for cringe-inducing gaffes. Maybe those would be less noticeable or relevant than before, given the nature and nuttiness of Trump's expectorations. But maybe they'd muffle the substance of his message. Between his verbal fumbling, his attempts to recover from it and all the shiny, meaningless objects that Trump gets journalists to chase, a Biden-Trump matchup could turn into a total circus, and who flourishes in that kind of habitat? Trump. He can out-clown Bozo and the specter in ""It"" combined. While Biden, at 76, is only four years older than Trump, Democrats have had more luck over recent decades with presidential candidates younger than their Republican opponents. ""In the last century, the party has never won with a non-incumbent who was older than 52,"" Thor Hogan, who teaches politics at Earlham College, wrote in The Washington Post recently. That ""makes perfect sense,"" Hogan added. ""Democrats are the party of progress, of hope and of change."" They're already straining that brand with their trio of top leaders in the House: Nancy Pelosi, 78; Steny Hoyer, 79; and Jim Clyburn, 78. They're going to plump up the septuagenarian society further with their 2020 nominee? ""It would be tragic for Democrats to squander an obvious chance at an age and health and vigor and generational contrast to Trump,"" another Democratic strategist said. That's a contrast plenty of local Democratic operatives want. On the same day that Biden trumpeted his qualifications in Montana, The Wall Street Journal reported that it had surveyed the Democratic chairmen and chairwomen of all 99 counties in Iowa; that 76 responded; and that while there was no consensus on the issues or positions that a 2020 nominee should emphasize, 43 of these leaders indicated a preference for ""a young candidate"" and ""a fresh face."" As that latter phrase suggests, Biden's problem isn't just age. A candidate can be old in years and relatively new to presidential politics (Elizabeth Warren, 69; Mike Bloomberg, 76) or old in years and the champion of new directions (Bernie Sanders, 77). Neither of those descriptions applies to Biden. His party can't get enough of the word ""progressive,"" but he's regressive, symbolizing a step back to an administration past. Don't get me wrong: That's infinitely preferable to the indecent present. But it's a questionable campaign slogan. He has said that he'll decide in the next month or two whether to run — whether he's willing to spend that much time away from his grandchildren. For their sake, I hope he stays on the sidelines. For our sake, too. I invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter. You can follow me on Twitter (@FrankBruni). "

",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/opinion/sunday/paul-manafort-lies.html,1097," Maybe Paul Manafort simply has more chutzpah than the rest of us. Here's a man convicted of financial fraud, facing further criminal prosecution for the lies he's accused of telling, who makes a deal to protect himself and proceeds, according to a memo sent to a federal judge on Friday, to lie to the prosecutors. Accused of lying, he offers as evidence in his defense … what appear to be more lies. There are no good reasons to believe him, and yet he seems to brashly lie nevertheless.  When we look at photos of Mr. Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, coming and going from court, he tends to be smiling, the proud, bold deceiver. When we see pictures of Mr. Trump's disgraced former lawyer Michael Cohen, by contrast, we see the glum, shamefaced confessor of the truth. But perhaps chutzpah does not entirely explain Mr. Manafort's dishonesty. When considering the virtue of truthfulness and its opposite, mendaciousness, Aristotle identified two common kinds of lying characters: the boaster and the flatterer. The boaster, he said, ""claims more than he has"" and is ""a contemptible sort of fellow"" but ""seems futile rather than bad."" The vanity of the boaster is easily spotted, and consequently he tends to harm no one other than himself. He is at best a kind of amusing buffoon; at worst, an annoyance. It seems to me this is one helpful way to think about a case like Mr. Manafort's. The notorious $15,000 ostrich jacket, the desperate living beyond his means, the ostentatiousness — these all very predictably go with the pretense of the boaster. Why would Mr. Manafort lie, even to Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor? At least one reason would be that he's showing off. There is something of the flatterer, too, in Mr. Manafort. The flatterer does to another what the boaster does to himself. With his lies, he tries to convince the one he flatters that the flattered is better than he is in reality. The flatterer affects this simulation, of course, because he seeks to gain some advantage for himself by pleasing the flattered. For this reason I suspect that Mr. Mueller and his team have heard as much praise from Paul Manafort as Donald Trump must have, back when they were still palling around. Aristotle's famous point about virtue and vice is that both are habits that one cultivates. A case like Mr. Manafort's, by these lights, is more a cause for pity than for anger, and is easy to make sense of: Why would Mr. Manafort continue to dissimulate, even when it clearly runs counter to his own interests? Well, because that's what he's always done and always does. He doesn't exactly intend to mislead; it's just what comes naturally. Even if Mr. Manafort is consciously, deliberately lying, he's foolish to do it and he's doing a bad job of it. Of course, he may well have a Machiavellian rationale in his head. ""Those best at playing the fox have done better than the others,"" Machiavelli wrote, speaking of the powerful. ""But you have to know how to disguise your slyness, how to pretend one thing and cover up another."" There are many more such arguments in defense of the necessity of lying for people who want to control the rest of us, and indeed this view agrees with what most of us believe about politicians in particular and power player types in general. Even Machiavelli, however, insisted that one must avoid lying too much, because people will stop believing you, and your lies will no longer work. Before we get carried away feeling superior to Mr. Manafort, we should admit we are all experts in deception. Politeness and other forms of social expediency prevent us from telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth every day. Evolutionary psychologists teach us that lies, self-deception and hypocrisy are essential to ordinary psychological well-being and the survival of the human species. We bluff our way through a lot of life.  So we might do well to think of Mr. Manafort as a kind of outlier or cautionary tale, an extreme example of a weakness we all share, rather than as a case of exceptional vice in the midst of our more ordinary virtue. Although many of us would like to think of Mr. Manafort as a scheming, calculating, coldblooded Prince of Lies, it's probably the case that he has told so many different stories over the course of a long career as a liar that at this point he longer quite knows what the truth is. As Nietzsche taught us, we tend to deceive ourselves about when, how and why we lie, and even about the act of lying itself.  Why? At least in part because lies are more effective when we don't know that we are lying. ""There must be self-deception in order to produce a great effect,"" Nietzsche wrote. If this is true, unfortunately for Mr. Manafort — and, one worries, for our president — one can become so confused about the distinction between truth and falsity that one can no longer really tell the difference. We might actually prefer that Mr. Manafort be a straightforward liar, because the unmindful liar is more dangerous, both to himself and to others. As Mr. Dryden admonishes T.E. Lawrence in ""Lawrence of Arabia"": ""If we've been telling lies, you've been telling half-lies. A man who tells lies, like me, merely hides the truth. But a man who tells half-lies has forgotten where he put it."" I think, in short, that we can learn from the pitiable case of Paul Manafort. The truth requires courage rather than cowardice. For us ordinary human beings, the right thing to do is most often the difficult thing to do, and this is especially so when it comes to knowing and speaking the truth. It's almost always easier, lazier, more convenient to boast, to flatter, to lie, to fail to interrogate yourself about why you believe what you do. But we've seen where these habits led Mr. Manafort, over the course of his life, and none of us want to join him there. And what about Mr. Manafort? Like most liars, he's probably feeling lonely, with only his secrets to comfort him. But if I'm right, and he no longer really knows the difference between truth and lie, he's lost even his secrets.

So for guidance he called an old friend in Bladenboro, L. McCrae Dowless Jr., a low-level local official with a criminal record who nonetheless had once been feted as ""guru of elections"" in Bladen County. Mr. Dowless soon had the sealed ballots in his hands and was off to the post office to mail them, Mr. Thompson said. Mr. Thompson, who works in the maintenance department at a DuPont plant, said in an interview he was grateful. But the act was apparently illegal in North Carolina, where, except in limited circumstances, it is a felony to collect another person's absentee ballot. In this rural region near the state's southern border, where candidates are often intimately known as neighbors, friends or enemies, Mr. Dowless ran a do-it-all vote facilitating business that was part of the community fabric. While cash-driven voter turnout efforts are a cottage industry in campaign seasons, Mr. Dowless's operation appeared to run like a family business that crossed lines laid out in election law. Dozens of interviews and an examination of thousands of pages of documents portray Mr. Dowless, a former car salesman, as a local political opportunist who was quick to seek ballots, collect them or offer rides to the polls. He employed a network of part-time helpers, some of them his own relatives, who, lured by promises of swift cash payments, would fan out across southeastern North Carolina in get-out-the-vote efforts for whichever candidate happened to be footing that year's bill. But that network operated with little oversight and accountability, critics say, and now Mr. Dowless has drawn national scrutiny amid a sprawling electoral fraud investigation that could result in a rare redo in a race for Congress. Investigators are examining accounts of Mr. Dowless and people connected to his operation collecting absentee ballots directly from residents. Word of this apparent practice has stirred fears that those ballots were reported — or not reported — in ways that helped the Republican nominee, Mark Harris, to prevail by just 905 votes last month. The state's election board has declined to certify Mr. Harris as the winner in the Ninth Congressional District, and is expected to hold an evidentiary hearing this month. On Friday, the state identified Mr. Dowless as a ""person of interest"" in its investigation. The scandal has been a setback for Mr. Harris, a pastor-turned-aspiring lawmaker whose campaign strategists hired Mr. Dowless for a get-out-the vote drive. And it has been an embarrassment for leaders of the Republican Party, who have spent years fretting that electoral fraud could come from undocumented immigrants. Now they are grappling with the possibility that it may have come from one of their own. But over the years, Democrats and Republicans alike in North Carolina courted Mr. Dowless, who, over almost 15 years, went from being a registered Democrat to unaffiliated to Democrat to unaffiliated to Republican. They fraternized with him, and hired him to work his magic in service of boosting their vote tallies. They did so even though local news reports going back to at least 2010 noted his criminal record, which included felony convictions for perjury and fraud. And they did so despite longstanding rumors that his get-out-the-vote tactics were unsavory at the least, and perhaps illegal. ""I only knew of him that he was crooked, as far as elections are concerned, and he had a way of doing it, and avoided prosecution and that kind of thing,"" said Ben Snyder, the chairman of the Bladen County Democratic Party, who said he did not meet Mr. Dowless in person until 2016. Dallas Woodhouse, the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, said he had heard ""a lot of chatter"" about voter turnout operations over the years in Bladen County but paid it little mind because prosecutors never brought cases. ""Nothing sort of ever happened,"" he said, ""so I think you assume that there's a whole lot of noise."" In Bladen County this year, Mr. Harris won 61 percent of the accepted absentee ballots, even though registered Republicans accounted for only 19 percent of the ballots submitted. Both the state elections board and the United States House of Representatives, which Democrats will control beginning in January, could force a new election in North Carolina. On Wednesday night, Mr. Dowless opened his door with a cigarette between his knuckles as a holiday light machine projected a whirling, speckled glow onto his modest house. In the side yard, a campaign sign for Mr. Harris rested in the grass. Mr. Dowless said he could not talk, given the controversy. ""I don't mean to be rude,"" he said. On Friday, he again declined to be interviewed but this time recited a phone number for a lawyer, who did not respond to a message. Local residents said Mr. Dowless — who is also a soil and water conservation district supervisor — was busy but available. ""If you need help he's going to help you out,"" said Barry Hester, 64, a retired construction worker who went to high school with Mr. Dowless. ""Like people who aren't so fortunate. If they need a ride, they'll call McCrae.'' Politicians and voters said Mr. Dowless depended on cash and a short paper trail. ""Everything was verbal,"" said Pete Givens, who briefly hired Mr. Dowless for a Charlotte City Council campaign last year. The Dowless operation also relied on workers like Ginger Eason, who told WSOC, a Charlotte television station, that Mr. Dowless paid her $75 to $100 a week to go door to door this year to encourage people to vote for Mr. Harris and a candidate for sheriff. She also said she picked up completed absentee ballots and brought them to Mr. Dowless, but was not sure what he did with them. ""I don't know nothing what happened after I dropped them off,"" she said. Kirby Wright, 47, and his mother, Doris Lee Hammonds, 77, recall that a women they recognized as Ms. Eason came to their home one night to pick up their absentee ballots. The pair had thick envelopes containing their absentee ballots but never filled them out. When Ms. Eason came by, she said she needed them. ""I told her I was going to throw it away,"" Mr. Wright said in an interview. ""It was blank. She said, 'No, I've got to pick up all the empty ballots.'"" Ms. Eason could not be reached for comment. Mr. Wright said he isn't sure what happened to the ballot designated for his mother, who is bedridden. It might have been thrown in the trash, he said. But state records show Ms. Hammonds cast an absentee ballot by mail. Ms. Hammonds, also interviewed, said she never filled it out or signed the absentee ballot at all. Ms. Eason told the Charlotte television station that she never discarded any ballots. But a large number of unreturned absentee ballots in Bladen County, as well as adjacent Robeson County, prompted concerns among elections officials, campaign strategists and independent researchers that Mr. Dowless's network may have engaged in wider fraud. So do the accounts of some voters. At Village Oaks, an apartment complex in Bladenboro, several residents said they had seen a truck at the complex with a Harris campaign placard at the same time that groups of three or four women would appear to collect ballots or encourage people to request absentee ballots during election season. ""They were around, saying they would help people cast absentee ballots,"" said Barbie Silvas, who mailed in a ballot this year. ""They said, 'I'm here for McCrae to help people to vote.'"" Mr. Dowless appeared in the news in the early 1990s after he was accused of taking out, and collecting on, a life insurance policy on an employee who had just died, backdating it and forging a signature. He ultimately spent about six months in prison, according to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety. Less than two decades later, he was one of a handful of get-out-the-vote experts who wielded significant influence in Bladen County, a struggling rural area where one in four people live below the poverty line. Records show that beginning in 2009, at least seven Democratic and Republican candidates paid him for work. In 2010, Mr. Dowless worked for a Democratic candidate for district attorney. A local television station at that time named Mr. Dowless as one of ""a few heavy hitters in the Bladen County get-out-the-vote arena."" Part of the local political culture, the station reported, involved political operatives distributing sample ballots for which they had sold spots to the highest-bidding candidates. The Republican candidate, Jonathan M. David, eventually won the election. He criticized the pay-to-play tactics, which he said ""lets a small group of people who don't have the best interest of the community at heart, but their own financial interest at stake, to dictate who becomes important leaders in their community."" That same year produced a political landmark for Bladen County, which elected a Democrat as its first black sheriff. The racial backlash — the county was then 56 percent white and 35 percent black — was palpable, recalled Patsy Sheppard, now a vice chairwoman of the local Democratic Party. She recalled hearing her fellow whites say, ""We need a white sheriff."" When a white challenger, James A. McVicker, emerged in 2014, Mr. Dowless was able to earn several thousand dollars in cash helping to get him elected by running a 20-worker absentee ballot operation. According to records in a lawsuit, Mr. Dowless was paid $5,800 in cash by Jeffrey Smith, the owner of a video gambling parlor, who was worried that the incumbent sheriff would raid the business. Mr. McVicker, a Republican, won — and Mr. Smith's business was raided anyway. His company filed a lawsuit against the new sheriff and noted that Mr. McVicker had won the election by almost 350 votes. Mr. Smith's lawyers implied in a court filing that without ""Mr. Dowless' efforts"" on absentee ballots, Mr. McVicker would not have won. In 2014, state records show, Mr. Dowless opened a consulting business with Jens L. Lutz, a local Democratic activist. Mr. Lutz, one of two Democrats on Bladen County's four-member elections board, said Friday that he only went into business with Mr. Dowless as a kind of sleuthing operation to root out the unethical tactics he thought Mr. Dowless employed. ""I knew there was some suspicion and I was doing it to solidify any suspicion of any wrongdoing,"" Mr. Lutz said, but added that he found it difficult to learn many of Mr. Dowless's methods. (After The New York Times questioned Mr. Lutz on Friday about his dealings with Mr. Dowless, Mr. Lutz resigned from the elections board.) Meanwhile, word had spread to neighboring Robeson County that Mr. Dowless had a formula for delivering victories. Mickey Meekins heard the word, and decided to call Mr. Dowless when decided to run for county commissioner in 2014. But after paying Mr. Dowless $20,000, Mr. Meekins rapidly became disenchanted. ""They actually didn't get no vote,"" said Mr. Meekins, who lost, adding that he assumed Mr. Dowless used sloppy or suspect tactics. In January 2016, the consulting firm he founded with Mr. Lutz dissolved, but Mr. Dowless continued his own work. One client was Todd Johnson, a Republican who, along with Mr. Harris, wanted to unseat Robert M. Pittenger, the incumbent congressman in the Ninth District. Mr. Johnson, who lives near Charlotte, a city almost three hours from Bladen County's seat, finished last in the primary race, but dominated in Bladen. Of 226 absentee-by-mail votes in the county, Mr. Johnson received 221. Mr. Pittenger recalled that he, too, could have hired Mr. Dowless. The men met, the congressman said, but Mr. Pittenger ""quickly ended the meeting over personal concerns with his proposal."" ""We didn't talk long enough for me to gather detailed information,"" Mr. Pittenger said. ""I just knew I didn't want to be involved with him."" In April, just ahead of this year's Republican primary, Herman Dunn, Bladen County's former chief deputy sheriff, saw Mr. Dowless at a polling place. Mr. Dunn wrote in an affidavit that Mr. Dowless told him he was ""doing absentee"" work for both Mr. McVicker, the sheriff, and Mr. Harris. ""You know I don't take checks,"" Mr. Dowless said, according to Mr. Dunn, who had worked for the sheriff Mr. McVicker defeated. ""They have to pay me cash."" According to Mr. Dunn, Mr. Dowless also boasted that he had more than 80 people under his command in Mr. Harris's race. (That figure could not be independently corroborated. Red Dome Group, the consulting firm that contracted with Mr. Dowless on behalf of Mr. Harris's campaign, did not respond to requests for comment.) As the state's investigation into potential fraud continues, people like Jeneva Legions wonder about their voting experiences. Ms. Legions, 30, who lives in the Village Oaks apartments, said she'd had her absentee ballot for a day or two when several women came to her door. One of the women said, 'Are you Jeneva? I've come to get your ballot,'"" Ms. Legions said. When Ms. Legions told them she had not voted yet, one of the women told her she should sign the ballot and fill in her Social Security number. The women left, Ms. Legions said. Not long afterward, one of the women returned. ""I gave it to her,"" Ms. Legions said in a telephone interview. ""I thought she worked for the county. I thought she was one of the voting people coming to get my ballot."" Ms. Legions said she had not sealed the envelope when she gave it to the woman. Her ballot, records show, was never returned to elections officials."

News,2018-12-09,"BEIJING — China’s leadership is trying to strike a delicate balance between outrage and necessity, as it seeks to maintain a recent thaw with the United States while lashing out at the arrest of a top Chinese tech executive.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/09/technology/canada-china-huawei-meng-wanzhou.html,1263," BEIJING — China's leadership is trying to strike a delicate balance between outrage and necessity, as it seeks to maintain a recent thaw with the United States while lashing out at the arrest of a top Chinese tech executive. That balancing act was on display in Beijing on Sunday, as the Chinese government said it had summoned the American ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, to protest the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese electronics giant Huawei and the elder daughter of its founder. Earlier in the day, People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, warned of ""serious consequences"" against the Canadian authorities who arrested Ms. Meng on an American warrant. She was detained in Canada more than a week ago on suspicion of fraud involving violations of United States sanctions in Iran. ""Only by correcting its mistake, immediately ending its violation of a Chinese citizen's lawful and legitimate rights and giving the Chinese people a due explanation, can Canada avoid paying a heavy price,"" the editorial said. But at a high-level conference on Sunday at Tsinghua University in Beijing that included four Nobel laureates in economics from the United States, a senior adviser to the Chinese leadership opened his remarks by praising the two countries' broader economic relationship and avoiding any mention of the arrest. ""The economies of China and the United States are integrated,"" said the adviser, Ma Jianting, a vice president of the Development Research Council, the policy advisory unit of China's cabinet. ""There is no parting of the ways."" Mr. Ma's remarks were the latest of many signs that the Chinese government was trying to compartmentalize the Huawei issue, while still taking an assertive enough stance to satisfy nationalistic anger in China. Beijing has taken a series of steps to improve trans-Pacific relations since President Trump and President Xi Jinping called a truce in their trade war at the end of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires; Ms. Meng was detained on the same day. On Thursday, hours after word of Ms. Meng's arrest in Canada spread publicly in China, a Commerce Ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, said that Beijing was ""full of confidence in reaching a deal in the 90 days."" He also confirmed for the first time a White House assertion that China would be buying American food, energy and cars following the truce, but declined to provide any details. Mr. Trump agreed in Buenos Aires to defer plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion a year in Chinese goods on Jan. 1. In the United States on Sunday, Robert Lighthizer, the trade representative who is leading the American talks with China, made clear that he considered March 1 ""a hard deadline"" for the negotiations. ""When I talk to the president of the United States, he is not talking about going beyond March,"" Mr. Lighthizer said on the CBS program ""Face the Nation,"" adding, ""If there is a deal to be gotten, we want to get it in the next 90 days."" Mr. Lighthizer also said that the trade talks should not be affected by the arrest of Ms. Meng. ""This is a criminal justice matter. It is totally separate from anything that I work on or anything that the trade policy people in the administration work on."" China's leaders are coincidentally preparing to observe this month the 40th anniversary of the country's post-Mao economic overhaul by calling for a series of moves to open up the economy to more trade and foreign investment, people familiar with Chinese policymaking said. The anniversary, heavily promoted in official propaganda and the subject of Sunday's conference at Tsinghua University, offers Mr. Xi a chance to take market-opening measures sought by the United States without seeming to give in to American pressure. The final list of moves is still the subject of considerable discussion within the Chinese bureaucracy. But some options under serious consideration include further reducing tariffs on imports from all over the world and encouraging broader foreign investment in the slowing Chinese economy. China made some moves in these directions this year, however, and it is unclear how much further the Beijing leadership is willing to go. By Beijing's calculation, China's average tariffs have already fallen to 7.5 percent from 9.8 percent at the start of this year. By comparison, average tariffs in the United States are 3.5 percent, while the European Union's are 5 percent. Ms. Meng's detention has considerably complicated China's economic relations with the United States. It has ignited anger and astonishment in China, where Huawei, one of the country's largest and most internationally successful private companies, is a source of national pride. On Saturday, China's vice foreign minister, Le Yucheng, summoned the Canadian ambassador to Beijing, John McCallum, to register his protest, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency. The Canadian Embassy declined to comment on Sunday. One reason for the outrage is that few people in China are aware that their government has quietly been blocking some Americans from leaving the country without filing charges against them or accusing them of wrongdoing. The State Department issued a travel advisory last January cautioning that ""individuals not involved in legal proceedings or suspected of wrongdoing have also"" been subjected to ""lengthy exit bans in order to compel their family members or colleagues to cooperate with Chinese courts or investigators."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized the bans during a visit to China in October. Last month, he raised with a top Chinese foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, his concern about an exit ban imposed on two young Americans who visited China last June and were not allowed to leave. At a bail hearing on Friday in Vancouver, British Columbia, where Ms. Meng was arrested on Dec. 1 while changing planes, Canadian prosecutors said that she had taken part in a scheme to trick financial institutions into making transactions that violated American sanctions against Iran. A warrant for Ms. Meng's arrest was issued in the Eastern District of New York on Aug. 22, said John Gibb-Carsley, a lawyer with Canada's Justice Department. Sino-American trade relations were at a low point then, with the United States imposing its second stage of tariffs on $50 billion a year in Chinese goods. A Canadian judge then issued a warrant for Ms. Meng on Nov. 30, after it became known that she would change planes in Vancouver on her way to Mexico from Hong Kong. By the end of Friday, no bail had been set. The hearing is set to continue on Monday morning. Huawei has said it has no knowledge of wrongdoing by Ms. Meng. In a statement released after the hearing on Friday, a company spokesman said, ""We have every confidence that the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will reach the right conclusion."" The United States government has been looking into Huawei's business in Iran for years. After investigating sanctions violations by Huawei's main Chinese rival, ZTE, the Commerce Department issued heavy fines and required it to replace its senior leadership. But coming in a year of tariffs and other measures aimed at curbing China's efforts to upgrade its technological capabilities, Ms. Meng's arrest has reinforced the feeling among many people in China that Washington is using every means at its disposal to hold back their nation's economic ascent. That feeling makes it harder for economic reformers in China to support trade compromises with the United States. ""China will not stir up trouble. But it is also not afraid of trouble,"" People's Daily said in its editorial. ""Nobody should underestimate China's confidence, willpower and strength."""
News,2018-12-09,The van Gogh and the Monet are safely in storage in Switzerland. The Oscar that once belonged to Marlon Brando is in a federal warehouse in Texas. Those were easy enough to corral.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/09/arts/jho-low-1mdb-assets-piano.html,1500," The van Gogh and the Monet are safely in storage in Switzerland. The Oscar that once belonged to Marlon Brando is in a federal warehouse in Texas. Those were easy enough to corral. But when the $250 million yacht was finally captured in Bali, the United States government couldn't let it bob in the water unattended, so it had to pay for a crew. The $35 million Bombardier jet has been grounded, but it needed an engine test costing up to $25,000. And no one is quite sure what to do with the see-through grand piano now sitting in a supermodel's Malibu home. It won't fit through the door. All of the items, and many more, had been bought by a flamboyant Malaysian financier named Jho Low, who prosecutors say helped siphon billions of dollars from a Malaysian government investment fund, then went on a colossal spending spree. It is one of the largest international kleptocracy cases the United States has ever pursued. It is so expansive that just tracking down, retrieving and maintaining the loot has become a complex multinational operation in itself. Court documents and interviews describe a recovery effort that involves half a dozen federal agencies, a bevy of contractors and investigators in countries including Switzerland, Luxembourg and Malaysia. Its targets include more than a dozen properties in New York, California and London, including a $31 million condominium in the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, the Viceroy L'Ermitage Beverly Hills hotel and a $17.5 million mansion in Beverly Hills that came with a gold-tipped pyramid floating in a reflecting pool. The process has been slowed because of the pending criminal case, which itself is lagging because Mr. Low, 37, is a fugitive believed to be hiding in China. There are also thorny legal issues because Mr. Low and some of the other defendants have denied wrongdoing and are challenging the forfeitures. Several of the items are owned by trusts, and Mr. Low ""does not consider it proper for any government to seize property belonging to the trusts or himself,"" said Robin Rathmell, Mr. Low's lawyer. The United States took the lead in the investigation because it has been cracking down on the flow of illegal money through the American financial system, and because until a few months ago, Malaysia's own government was being run by the very people accused of ripping it off. The fund at the center of the investigation, called the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund or 1MDB, was supposed to benefit ordinary Malaysians. It raised billions of dollars from banks and borrowed from investors, ostensibly to finance projects like a joint venture with a Saudi oil company and the purchase of power plants. But prosecutors say 1MDB became a ""massive, brazen and blatant"" money-laundering scheme, in which billions were diverted into the bank accounts of senior officials, including the former prime minister Najib Razak, his family and associates and Mr. Low. The scandal led to the ouster of Mr. Najib. It also has ensnarled Goldman Sachs, which helped 1MDB raise money; a Justice Department employee who pleaded guilty to helping Mr. Low funnel money into the United States; and Elliott Broidy, a top fund-raiser for President Trump who was paid to lobby the administration to stop the investigation. (Mr. Broidy is not accused of any crime.) Laundering the money, prosecutors say, involved a complex network of opaque bank accounts and shell companies registered in exotic locations like the British Virgin Islands. But the idea was simple: Use 1MDB as a vehicle to draw in big money. And then spend it. Some $200 million was used to buy artwork. There was a 22-carat pink diamond necklace worth $27.3 million, said to have been given to Mr. Najib's wife. (Her lawyers say that while she saw the necklace, which has gone missing, she never actually received it.) Tens of millions of dollars went toward financing Hollywood films including ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""Daddy's Home"" through a production studio called Red Granite Pictures, which was owned by Riza Aziz, Mr. Najib's stepson. Red Granite has settled with the government for $60 million without admitting wrongdoing. A quarter billion was spent on a custom-built mega-yacht with a movie theater, helicopter pad and enough space for dozens of crew members. Indonesian authorities said the boat's transponder was turned off at times, making it difficult for the F.B.I. to track it, but the yacht, called the Equanimity, was finally seized in Bali this year. The United States then staffed it with a crew until it was turned over to Malaysia's custody. Mr. Low, who had a self-proclaimed taste for the very finest things, also used some of the money to lavish gifts on celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and the Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr, prosecutors say. In 2014, Mr. Low bought the clear-acrylic grand piano from Crystal Music Company in the Netherlands and had it delivered to Ms. Kerr in Malibu. Peter Tol, the company's founder, declined to discuss the price but said that his custom pieces now cost from $170,000 to upward of $1 million. It has been a centerpiece of Ms. Kerr's home. She has been photographed lounging on its lid in a Giorgio Armani gown and has been recorded tapping out a simple song called ""The Flea Waltz."" Mark Fabiani, a lawyer for Ms. Kerr, said she is happy to relinquish the piano. But it's not clear that it is worth the effort to get it out. ""If you move it, you might damage it, and then you have to restore it,"" said Michael Case, the asset forfeiture coordinator for the United States Marshals Service in Manhattan, speaking generally about such operations. This extraction would be especially complicated. When Mr. Tol delivered the piano, he was horrified to learn it would be left on an outdoor deck, protected only by an overhang. ""This was hurting my soul very much,"" he said. ""I strongly advised them to close that area."" Ms. Kerr followed his advice. But those new walls are a problem for the government, which believes it would have to do some demolition to get the piano out, according to two people with knowledge of the investigation who were not authorized to speak publicly. Then a very expensive house would have to be repaired. So for now, the piano stays. Other tokens of Mr. Low's esteem have been easier to retrieve. Ms. Kerr handed over a substantial amount of jewelry, including an 11.71-carat heart-shaped diamond and a pair of 11-carat diamond earrings. Mr. DiCaprio, too, has relinquished his gifts, including Picasso's ""Nature Morte au Crâne de Taureau"" (Still Life With Bull's Head) and a collage called ""Redman One"" by Jean-Michel Basquiat, both of which he had stored in Switzerland. He also gave up Brando's 1954 Oscar for ""On the Waterfront."" According to ""Billion Dollar Whale,"" a book about Mr. Low by two Wall Street Journal reporters, the statue had disappeared from Mr. Brando's Hollywood home; Mr. Low bought it for $600,000 from a film memorabilia dealer. Unfortunately for the government, when any post-1950 Oscar is put up for sale, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has the right to buy it for $1, a spokeswoman for the academy said. In Malaysia itself, the haul has been immense. Just days after Mr. Najib was voted out, the police raided six residences connected to him. They seized 35 bags of cash in 26 currencies, and it took 22 officers three days to determine their full value — about $30 million. There were bags of gold (25), Hermes handbags (272) and watches (423). Everything is being stored in Kuala Lumpur at the Malaysian central bank. ""The numbers were just too huge for us to do the accounting on the premises,"" said Amar Singh, who led the asset seizures for the Royal Malaysian Police. Mr. Najib has denied wrongdoing, and Farhan Shafee, a member of his legal team, said, ""As far as we can see and as far as the documents provided show, the assets that were seized have nothing to do with the charges that have been brought."" As for Mr. Tol, the piano maker, he said he felt terrible if he had unwittingly accepted money ""destined for the normal people of Malaysia."" ""I don't like it,"" he said. ""It is not my way of life."" Vickey Barron, a real estate broker who sold a $51 million penthouse in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood to another man later implicated in the 1MDB case, Khadem al-Qubaisi, recalled the transaction as a blur. (Mr. al-Qubaisi has been jailed in Abu Dhabi since 2016, making it difficult to defend himself, his lawyer said.) An entourage of about half a dozen people had zipped through a tour of the apartment, and within a day, a representative called to say they would take it. She called it one of the strangest deals she'd ever done. ""I take longer to buy a pair of sneakers,"" she said, ""than he took to buy the apartment."""
News,2018-12-09,"WASHINGTON — The 2020 Democratic presidential primary, already expected to be the party’s most wide open in decades, has been jostled on the eve of many long-plotted campaign announcements by a political threat that few contenders bothered considering until recently:",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/09/us/politics/beto-2020-presidential-race.html,1880," WASHINGTON — The 2020 Democratic presidential primary, already expected to be the party's most wide open in decades, has been jostled on the eve of many long-plotted campaign announcements by a political threat that few contenders bothered considering until recently: Will a soon-to-be-former congressman, with an unremarkable legislative record and a Senate campaign loss, upend their best-laid plans? Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas has emerged as the wild card of the presidential campaign-in-waiting for a Democratic Party that lacks a clear 2020 front-runner. After a star-making turn in his close race against Senator Ted Cruz, Mr. O'Rourke is increasingly serious about a 2020 run — a development that is rousing activists in early-voting states, leading veterans of former President Barack Obama's political operation (and Mr. Obama himself) to offer their counsel and hampering would-be rivals who are scrambling to lock down influential supporters and strategists as future campaign staff. Advisers to other prospective Democratic candidates for 2020 acknowledge that Mr. O'Rourke is worthy of their concern. His record-setting success with small donors would test the grass-roots strength of progressives like Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. His sometimes saccharine call to summon the nation's better angels would compete with the likely pitch of Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. And his appeal to some former Obama advisers — and, potentially, his electoral coalition of young people, women and often infrequent voters — could complicate a possible run for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who would aim to win back many of his former boss's constituencies. Mr. O'Rourke would surely have vulnerabilities in a primary, including an absence of signature policy feats or a centerpiece issue to date. In his Senate race, he was often disinclined to go negative, frustrating some Democrats who believe he wasted a chance to defeat Mr. Cruz, and he struggled at times in some traditional formats like televised debates. He is, by admission and design, not the political brawler some Democrats might crave against a president they loathe. And his candidacy would not be history-making like Mr. Obama's nor many of his likely peers' in the field, in an election when many activists may want a female or nonwhite nominee. But the fact that Mr. O'Rourke is even considering a run speaks to uncertainty in the Democratic Party, as broad and simmering opposition to President Trump is colliding with crosscurrents of gender, race, ideology and age within its ranks. With the unceremonious exit of the Clintons, Mr. Obama's minimal appetite for party politics and the regret in some quarters about the 2016 primary coronation of Hillary Clinton, there are no obvious kingmakers in the party, nor many early calls for establishment intervention in the 2020 primary. As its House-flipping midterm formula made clear, the party now absorbs an array of voters, from ardent socialists to disaffected Republicans, across generational and ideological lines. And given that some three dozen Democrats are considering presidential campaigns, the primary field could end up so crowded that the vote gets diluted — a phenomenon that helped Mr. Trump edge ahead of the large Republican pack in 2016. As he and a small team of aides weigh the merits of a campaign, Mr. O'Rourke, 46, has focused largely on whether he could run the kind of race he did in Texas — barnstorming towns with a liberal message and a perpetual social media live-stream, talking up his disdain for pollsters and super PACs and staking his bid on a personal connection with voters as much as any issue platform. There are several questions Mr. O'Rourke is considering aloud, a person close to him said: Could he build a full-scale national campaign without losing the down-home feel that powered his Senate bid, when fans tracked his 254-county tour of Texas (down to the four-hour drives and late-night burger runs) on a near-constant video feed? Would a hope-and-change chorus find an audience in a primary with other Democrats — and without an easy Republican foil like Mr. Cruz? Yet Mr. O'Rourke also plainly recognizes two truths about politics in the age of Mr. Trump: Traditional qualifications to lead the country do not necessarily matter much, particularly if a candidate can channel the kind of enthusiasm that Mr. O'Rourke earned in a news media environment that prizes viral moments. And politicians rarely get shinier over time; his best shot at the White House, if recent history is a guide, may be this one. ""Democrats fall in love,"" said Gene Martin, a local Democratic chairman in New Hampshire, describing a ""pause"" in 2020 staffing activity in the state while Mr. O'Rourke makes up his mind. ""He would get a king's welcome."" At the same time, Mr. O'Rourke's flirtation is dividing some liberals who wonder if a white man with his résumé and biography is the best fit for this moment, just after the party recaptured the House, in large measure, on the strength of female and nonwhite candidates. ""What is it with a party that gets excited about a guy who loses but tries to undercut somebody who wins?"" said Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, describing the opposition among some Democrats to Nancy Pelosi's continued leadership in the House, despite her presiding over a midterm wave. ""Our party is emotional."" Other Democrats eyeing 2020 have said little about Mr. O'Rourke, as is customary with a possible rival in a race that has not begun. But several of their advisers said Mr. O'Rourke's popularity with donors and activists was undeniable and could create early momentum in key states, his prospects buoyed by a Trump-level command of social media and a talent for making the generically progressive sound inspirational. Like Mr. Obama as he entered the 2008 campaign, Mr. O'Rourke can be difficult to place on an ideological spectrum, allowing supporters to project their own politics onto a messaging palette of national unity and common ground — and concerning some activists on the left who worry that voters are valuing the wrong qualities. ""He says a lot of nice things,"" said Waleed Shahid, who worked for Mr. Sanders in 2016 and is now communications director for Justice Democrats, a progressive group. ""Then you try to remember anything that stood out in terms of policy ideas, and it's kind of flat."" In public, Mr. O'Rourke, who declined to be interviewed, has said only that he is not ruling anything out. In private, Mr. O'Rourke is doing little to discourage his suitors. When one well-connected Democrat asked Mr. O'Rourke what to tell operatives who hope to work for him, the congressman said to have them contact him on his cellphone, according to a party official directly familiar with the exchange. In recent weeks, Mr. O'Rourke has spoken with a leading Democratic fund-raiser about the financial demands of a presidential bid. He met with Mr. Obama shortly after the midterms, as The Washington Post first reported. Mr. Obama told Mr. O'Rourke he was impressed with the congressman's show-up-everywhere Senate run, according to a person familiar with the conversation. The former president has publicly compared this approach to his own. Mr. O'Rourke's camp has also been in contact with several members of the extended Obama orbit, and the congressman's chief of staff and de facto chief strategist, David Wysong, has reached out to a variety of Democratic consultants to ask about how to organize a run. From his Senate race, Mr. O'Rourke has also already built a 50-state list of supporters that could form the foundation of a sprawling volunteer network. Jeff Link, a longtime Iowa Democratic strategist, said Mr. O'Rourke's odometer-pushing campaign style would be a natural fit in a state where politicians crow about touching down in all 99 counties. ""If he comes to Des Moines and does a big event in the evening, he should think about the Knapp Center at Drake as opposed to a party room in a restaurant,"" Mr. Link said, referring to a 7,152-seat college basketball arena. The chief obstacle to a run, according to the person close to Mr. O'Rourke, is family considerations, after two years of taxing travel across his home state. He lives in El Paso with his wife, Amy, and three school-age children. Mr. O'Rourke, who received broadly positive news coverage as an underdog candidate in 2018, would also face far deeper scrutiny in a national field, renewing attention on episodes like a drunk driving arrest in his 20s, during which he attempted to leave the scene, according to a witness who spoke to the police at the time. (Mr. O'Rourke has denied trying to flee.) Perhaps more significant to his chances, the ascendant role of nonwhite voters in the party, paired with the backlash to Mr. Trump's weaponizing of race and gender, has raised doubts among some Democrats that a white male candidate can win the nomination. And the mere fact that Mr. O'Rourke, and not Stacey Abrams or Andrew Gillum, is the near miss candidate of 2018 who is being beckoned most forcefully toward the White House has bothered some Democrats. They note that Ms. Abrams and Mr. Gillum came closer to winning their races for governor in Georgia and Florida than Mr. O'Rourke did in his Senate bid. ""Why Beto and not the other two?"" asked Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina legislator. ""I think Andrew and Stacey are equally talented."" Mr. Sellers questioned whether Mr. O'Rourke could prevail in a nomination contest that will turn heavily on black voters in the South. ""I look forward to welcoming Beto to the Brookland Baptist Church,"" he said, alluding to a historically black church near Columbia, S.C. ""I would love to be there to see if he can clap on beat."" It has also not gone unnoticed that many of Mr. O'Rourke's most vocal boosters from Mr. Obama's circle are men. Jennifer Palmieri, a former senior aide to Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, responded on Twitter this week to a CNN op-ed titled, ""Beto-mania doesn't do justice to women."" ""Legit reasons to love Beto. But worth reflecting on this,"" Ms. Palmieri wrote. ""I fear intangible sentiments like 'something about him that's so inspiring' can be mirror images of 'something about her I just don't like' & tied to pesky gender bias we have yet to shake."" Unlike Mr. Obama just before 2008 — a sitting senator for whom no office but the presidency loomed as a plausible next step — Mr. O'Rourke has been urged at times to run again back home. Some Texas Democrats are hoping he tries another Senate race in 2020 or seeks the governorship in 2022. But there are limits to Mr. O'Rourke's appeal, of course: Mr. Obama performed better in some rural Texas counties in 2012 than Mr. O'Rourke did in 2018. ""I'd love for him to double down on what he just created and build on that,"" said Amber Mostyn, a Houston-based donor. If nothing else, Mr. Sellers suggested, the debate over a white man's viability in today's Democratic Party is a sign of the times. ""We've gone from people not believing Barack Obama can get the nomination, let alone win the presidency, because a black guy can't win,"" Mr. Sellers said, ""to the fact that it's going to be hard for Beto O'Rourke of El Paso to win."""
briefing,2018-12-09,"Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/09/briefing/john-f-kelly-paris-grammy-nominations-your-weekend-briefing.html,1491," Here are the week's top stories, and a look ahead. 1. A damning turn for President Trump and his associates: Federal prosecutors say he directed illegal payments during the presidential campaign to help prevent a possible sex scandal. The president's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has said Mr. Trump, above, directed payments to women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump. But in a memo arguing for a prison term for Mr. Cohen, prosecutors in Manhattan said Mr. Cohen ""acted in coordination and at the direction of an unnamed individual"" — a clear reference to Mr. Trump. Separately, the special counsel's office said that Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, had ""told multiple discernible lies"" about his contacts with Trump administration officials and his interactions with a Russian linked to Moscow's intelligence services. Together, the filings laid bare the most direct evidence to date linking Mr. Trump to potentially criminal conduct, and added to an already substantial case that Russia was seeking to sway the 2016 election in his favor. Have you been keeping up with the headlines? Test your knowledge with our news quiz. And here's the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles. ____ 2. John F. Kelly is out. The president said Saturday that Mr. Kelly, above, his second chief of staff, would leave his job by the end of the year. Mr. Kelly's departure had long been rumored amid signs that he and Mr. Trump had grown irritated with each other. The president said he would announce Mr. Kelly's replacement in the coming days. The leading candidate is the vice president's own chief of staff, Nick Ayers, a political operative who possesses the campaign savvy that Mr. Trump has craved. Mr. Trump also announced his pick for attorney general: William P. Barr, who served as head of the Justice Department in the first Bush administration. Mr. Barr is a skeptic of the Russia investigation and is known for his expansive vision of executive power. Speaking of personnel: One former cabinet member had some harsh words for Mr. Trump, who fired right back. Mr. Trump said his former secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, was ""dumb as a rock"" and ""lazy as hell"" after Mr. Tillerson said the president was undisciplined, did not like to read and regularly pushed him to take actions that were illegal. ____ 3. The war of words ended a somber week Washington, which bid farewell to former President George Bush. Beginning Monday night, Mr. Bush lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda. His coffin was draped in an American flag and placed on the catafalque built for President Abraham Lincoln. Thousands lined up to pay their respects. On Wednesday, at a funeral of pomp, pageantry and military precision, former President George W. Bush remembered his father as ""a commander in chief of formidable accomplishment and a gentleman who executed the duties of his office with dignity and honor."" (Our chief White House correspondent looks at the extraordinary relationship between the 41st and 43rd presidents.) President Trump and all four living former presidents, as well as more than 3,000 foreign leaders, lawmakers, Supreme Court justices and other mourners, were in attendance. Here are some major moments from the service. The comedian Dana Carvey wrote about his friendship with the elder Mr. Bush, whom he impersonated on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and activists reflected on Mr. Bush's ""mixed legacy"" on addressing the AIDS epidemic. ____ 4. Inside Jared Kushner's relationship with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia: The crown prince cultivated Mr. Kushner's friendship even before his succession, and the two men have had informal, private discussions. Several U.S. advisers worried that Mr. Kushner's political inexperience could make him a target for manipulation. Their close communication continued even after the killing of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi in October set off a firestorm across the world. Above, the crown prince, left, with Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, last year. The benefits of their relationship to the U.S. are uncertain, but it has paid off well for the Saudis. ____ 5. France was roiled by protests for the fourth weekend in a row, as thousands of the so-called Yellow Vests took to the streets across the country. In Paris, the protests turned violent, above, with the police firing water cannons and tear gas to control crowds. In a time of populist uprisings across the world, the Yellow Vests are different. Though the movement is filled with the working poor from rural areas, these demonstrators have deeper demands, including lower taxes, higher salaries and freedom from financial fear. President Emmanuel Macron's government has backed off on a planned fuel tax increase, but that has done little to assuage the protesters, whose outrage has morphed into a broader outcry at his economic policies. ____ 6. The arrest of a top executive at Huawei, one of China's flagship technology firms, has thrown President Trump's trade negotiations with China into disarray. Unlike another round of tariffs or tough rhetoric from American officials, the detention of the executive, Meng Wanzhou, above, appears to have driven home the rivalry between the United States and China in a visceral way for the Chinese establishment. China's president, Xi Jinping, now faces competing pressures: to show strength, perhaps by retaliating against the United States, but also to limit the cost of rising tensions on China's ruling class. The Justice Department is investigating Huawei on charges of violating sanctions on Iran. China sees the firm as an important driver of its global ambitions, but much of the world increasingly sees the company as a potential conduit for espionage and sabotage. ____ 7. The friction between the United States and China on a range of issues threatens to slow global action on climate change at a critical time. The emissions produced by both countries account for more than 40 percent of the global total — and those emissions went up this year. That fact is hovering over Katowice, Poland, where the United Nations is leading two weeks of talks on how to implement the Paris Agreement. In the U.S., the Trump administration is hurriedly clearing the way for oil exploration in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, seen above, as part of the administration's campaign to exploit fossil fuels and erase restrictive policies protecting the environment and addressing global warming. ____ 8. Some lawmakers are not taking their midterm losses quietly. After Gov. Scott Walker's stunning loss last month, Wisconsin Republicans pushed through a sweeping set of bills Wednesday designed to limit the power of the incoming Democratic leaders. The move sent protesters flooding into the State Capitol, above. Michigan Republicans followed suit, but may not have the support of their departing governor, Rick Snyder, who portrays himself as a pragmatic businessman. One congressional race in North Carolina is still not settled. Here's what we know — and don't know — about the election turmoil in the Ninth District, where the campaign of the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, hired a ""guru of elections"" who may have gone too far. ____ 9. ""Saturday Night Live"" brought back Robert De Niro in his role as Robert Mueller, the special counsel, who visited Eric Trump, played by Alex Moffat, in his Trump Tower bedroom. ""Mr. Mueller, people say you're the worst thing to ever happen to my dad,"" Moffat said. ""No, Eric,"" answered De Niro. ""Getting elected president was the worst thing that ever happened to your dad."" ____ 10. The nominees are here for the Grammys and the Golden Globes. For both awards, there were surprises, snubs and refreshing developments: All four of the Grammys' major categories — record of the year, song of the year, album of the year and best new artist — are dominated by women, including Cardi B, above. Our writers had some opinions on the picks. And our critics put out their guides to their favorite albums, movies and performances of the year. In case you missed it, the actor Kevin Hart stepped down as the host of the Oscars after an outcry over homophobic tweets and comments. ____ 11. Therapeutic cookie baking; the journalist Isabel Wilkerson on Michelle Obama's new memoir, ""Becoming,"" above; and President Trump's undocumented housekeeper speaks out: We have these stories and more in our Best Weekend Reads. For more suggestions on what to watch and listen to, may we suggest the latest small-screen recommendations from Watching, 11 new books our editors liked this week and our music critics' latest playlist.

Your well-informed Monday self will thank you. Speaking of which, tomorrow is ""Green Monday,"" coined by retailers for all the cash that procrastinators (like yours truly) will spend when they realize it's the second week of December and they haven't bought any holiday presents yet. Another reason it pays to shop early: Some Walmart customers received an extra gift last week, when two wealthy elves — the filmmaker Tyler Perry and the billionaire philanthropist Gayle Benson — paid off outstanding layaway accounts at their local stores. Anonymous donors picked up the tabs for shoppers in Colorado and Vermont, too.  Dec. 2-8 You might have noticed whiplash on Wall Street last week. Stocks rose on Monday on news of a trade cease-fire with China, then fell mightily late in the week, as investors reacted to the news that American officials orchestrated the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei (and the daughter of its founder). Ms. Meng's detention in Canada, and possible extradition to New York, poses trouble for the United States' relationship with China, which of course has been incredibly tense with the tariff battle that's hurting the economies of both countries. Adding insult to injury, Ms. Meng was detained on the same night that ""Tariff Man,"" a.k.a. President Trump, dined with China's president, Xi Jinping, in Argentina, where they agreed to the 90-day trade truce. The victim of Facebook's latest privacy breach: itself. On Wednesday, Britain's parliament released 250 pages of the company's internal documents, including emails between top executives. The messages revealed ruthless efforts to extract as much data as possible from users like you and me, and obscure the fact that it was doing so. The emails also show that the company wielded data like currency, bestowing special access to it as a reward to friendly businesses like Airbnb and Netflix while cutting off rivals. Facebook says the emails don't tell the full story. It must be painful to have private information given to others without your consent, right? The who's who of the oil industry huddled in Vienna to decide just how expensive a trip to the gas station will be next year. On everyone's mind was a glut of supply poised to flood markets and drive down prices even more, which would be nice for drivers' wallets but damaging for the oil economy. As predicted, Russia and Saudi Arabia buddied up to cut production and bolster prices, defying Mr. Trump's call for cheaper gas. (A viral video of the fratty high-five exchanged by President Vladimir Putin and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the recent gathering of the Group of 20 nations says it all.) DEC. 9-15 Will the rebellion continue? Members of France's ""Yellow Vest"" movement have carried out violent anti-government rallies to protest economic inequality and high unemployment rates (currently 9.1 percent). Though President Emmanuel Macron has backed down from a proposed gas tax increase, the policy that set off the furor, streets across France remain full of demonstrators. Wearing brightly colored roadside hazard vests, they have burned cars, broken windows and confronted riot police, particularly in fancy neighborhoods in Paris. Brace your stock portfolio for the possibility of more havoc, this time from Europe, as Britain's parliament votes on the Brexit plan this Tuesday. London traders are preparing for stressful market swings and long hours by bringing sleeping bags and even mini golf sets to the office. Given the proposal's chaotic birth and less-than-welcome reception, its passage is iffy. European Union leaders will convene in Brussels on Wednesday to commiserate (and, I assume, gossip) about the fallout. Uber will resume tests of its self-driving cars in the coming weeks, but don't expect an autonomous vehicle to pull up at your door anytime soon (or, for that matter, to help the company's bottom line before it goes public). In March, Uber stopped the program after one of its driverless cars killed a pedestrian in Arizona, and the company is now proceeding more cautiously. Unlike previous trials, when 200 test cars hit the streets in multiple cities under various driving conditions, the vehicles will now be limited to a one-mile loop between two offices in Pittsburgh. The cars won't operate at night or in wet weather, and they'll stay under 25 miles an hour. Michael Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer-slash-fixer, will be sentenced on Wednesday for multiple offenses, including willful tax evasion and various illegal campaign contributions. And last week, the Senate approved Kathy Kraninger, President Trump's nominee who has no experience in financial services, as the new head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo fired dozens of district managers. The dismissals were part of the bank's ongoing efforts to show regulators (and customers) that it is serious about cleaning up its sales practices. 3.7 percent: The unemployment rate in the United States in November. Economists were expecting a slightly larger increase in new hires, but the numbers are still good."
News,2018-12-09,"LONDON — When Lucy Ashton quit The Sheffield Star in 2009 to have children and work in public relations, she had already seen other reporters steadily leaving the paper as circulation and advertising fell, and figured she’d never see jobs being added again.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/09/business/bbc-local-news-partnership.html,1015," LONDON — When Lucy Ashton quit The Sheffield Star in 2009 to have children and work in public relations, she had already seen other reporters steadily leaving the paper as circulation and advertising fell, and figured she'd never see jobs being added again. Now she has returned, as part of a new initiative with a simple goal: to help news organizations cover local government. One of her first stories back showed the value of the initiative. At a Sheffield City Council meeting, female members of the board discussed how they had been the target of online harassment. Some of the abuse wasn't just online — one described how her home had been broken into by a harasser. ""That wasn't on the agenda,"" Ms. Ashton said. ""Without a reporter at that meeting, we wouldn't have got that."" In an unusual effort to revive coverage of local government, smaller news publishers in Britain can get a share of the BBC's license fee, the annual charge paid by every household with a television that has sustained the BBC as local newsroom budgets have shrunk. The money, 8 million pounds a year (about $10.2 million), is used by local newspapers and news sites to pay the salaries of additional reporters, like Ms. Ashton. Publications across Britain can apply for the reporting positions, and so far about 90 percent of the 144 places have been filled. The reporters, who are expected to be experienced journalists, receive additional training from the BBC and are paid a minimum of £22,000 each, a salary broadly comparable to other reporting positions at Britain's regional news organizations. The reporters are hired by the newspapers for an initial period of about two years. Matt Hancock, a member of Parliament and former minister for the government department responsible for media and culture, said he hoped the program would restore some vigor to the way local government was being covered. Fewer journalists were challenging statements by politicians, he said, and reporters who once covered public officials were now often working for them in public relations jobs. ""You think, hold on, is that really how to have a vibrant democracy?"" Mr. Hancock said. The Local News Partnership, which began this year, is one example of how the business model for local news reporting is stretching in ways that would have seemed unimaginable not long ago, including financing from nonprofit groups and revenue from government resources. And the tech giants are also putting up money: Google announced earlier this year that it would spend $300 million on supporting authoritative journalism, and Facebook has given $6 million to a community news project in Britain. The partnership with the BBC has already yielded some significant stories. Among them are these: ■ A sting operation by the Yorkshire police to uncover child exploitation found that local hotels usually failed to ask any questions when men accompanied by underage women checked in. ■ A local council in Merseyside had to answer for a glaringly incomplete road resurfacing project that paved around a parked car instead of trying to move it. ■ Residents of the Cotswolds discovered that their neighbor, Jake Dyson, heir to the Dyson vacuum cleaner company, had been granted approval to build a helipad at his 16th century home. Stories like these are helping to remind readers about areas that aren't always being covered, said Jeremy Clifford, editor in chief of Johnston Press, a chain of newspapers that includes The Sheffield Star. ""It's a really important investment in the lifeblood, our way of life,"" Mr. Clifford said. In return for the financing, newspapers cannot use the new positions as an opportunity to cut newsroom staffs, and must assign the reporters to cover local government beats. The BBC and dozens of media organizations are allowed to republish the articles, creating a kind of wire service for local news. For the BBC, the arrangement also serves as a counter to critics in Parliament who say that it can crowd out commercial companies. Some have even argued that the TV license fee should be scrapped. There are no strict benchmarks to determine whether the project has been a success. But organizers at the BBC and the News Media Association said they would measure how the stories were shared, how often they were picked up by other news outlets and whether attendance at meetings was affected by the presence of a reporter. Local politicians are starting to ""warm up"" to the idea of having reporters at their meetings again, said Daniel Ionescu, the managing editor at The Lincolnite, a digital news website serving Lincolnshire that has hired two reporters through the partnership. Some officials were taken aback to see reporters at their meetings, said Calvin Robinson, one of the reporters. Others put on a performance when they know that a reporter is in the room, said Daniel Jaines, the other Local News Partnership reporter at the website. ""If there's a reporter there, they're a lot more shouty,"" he said. Still, the financial pressure on local outlets continues to grow in Britain, where 136 newspapers shut down from 2012 to early 2018. In November Johnston Press, whose chain of papers includes Edinburgh's The Scotsman, entered administration, a form of bankruptcy. Facing £220 million in debt, the company said its lenders would buy it out. The partnership with the BBC will be no more than a Band-Aid over a gaping wound, said Roy Greenslade, a former editor and honorary visiting professor of journalism at City, University of London. ""These companies are gradually going out of business because their business model is wrecked, totally and utterly wrecked."" Mr. Ionescu said he had seen the traffic to his site driven by Facebook slow, and advertising money increasingly spent on platforms like Google and Facebook rather than local online publishers. He isn't sure there is much more that can be done to stave off the growing power of huge technology companies. ""I don't see what more they could do in order to tackle the advertising gap or the revenue gap,"" Mr. Ionescu said. ""The publishers who create everything, they just get the scraps."""

But how much could the scandal cost the firm? Wall Street has been trying to estimate the amount of legal penalties and settlements Goldman may pay after United States prosecutors unveiled a guilty plea by a former senior Goldman Sachs investment banker and charged a second banker. The affair appears to have taken its toll on Goldman's stock. Its shares are down 20 percent since the Justice Department's charges were revealed. By comparison, bank stocks as a whole are down 6 percent, and shares of Morgan Stanley, Goldman's rival, have fallen nearly 10 percent. The ultimate size of the legal hit may largely depend on whether the Department of Justice and others can demonstrate that Goldman's controls were inadequate and that wrongdoing could take place more easily in its environment. Regulators such as the Federal Reserve and the New York State Department of Financial Services may also decide to penalize Goldman. Malaysia's government set up a fund called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, in 2009. Goldman arranged three bond deals for the fund in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion. Federal prosecutors say more than $2.7 billion of that sum was misappropriated. Tim Leissner, a senior Goldman banker until 2016, pleaded guilty in August to taking part in bribery and money laundering schemes. The government has charged another former Goldman banker, Roger Ng, with conspiring to launder money and pay bribes. Mr. Ng was recently arrested by the Malaysian authorities, and the Justice Department intends to extradite him to the United States. Prosecutors have also brought charges against Jho Low, a Malaysian financier who served as an intermediary for Goldman in its dealings with Malaysian officials and 1MDB. According to the government, Mr. Leissner and Mr. Ng conspired with Mr. Low to hide his involvement with the fund. Prosecutors are also examining a private meeting in 2012 between Mr. Low and Lloyd C. Blankfein, then Goldman's chief executive, at the bank's headquarters in New York. Cooperating with law enforcement can help reduce penalties. Several analysts expect the government to force Goldman to disgorge the roughly $600 million it earned arranging the bond deals. The question is whether Goldman will also have to pay that amount, or twice the sum, to the government as a penalty. Goldman has shared 1MDB-related communications between its employees and others with prosecutors, according to a person briefed on the case. But the importance of such information to the Justice Department is not known. Goldman has publicly sought to portray the fraud as the work of a few employees who took significant steps to conceal the wrongdoing. ""These are guys who evaded our safeguards, and lie, stuff like that's going to happen,"" Mr. Blankfein said in early November. ""Somebody's going to use phones away from us, and personal this and personal that,"" he added, referring to personal devices. But the government documents suggest prosecutors might not be convinced that just a few employees were involved or that there weren't weaknesses in Goldman's compliance program. In the charges against Mr. Low, prosecutors said, referring to Goldman: ""The business culture at U.S. Financial Institution #1, particularly in Southeast Asia, was highly focused on consummating deals, at times prioritizing this goal ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions."" And in Mr. Leissner's charging document, prosecutors contended that ""other employees and agents"" of Goldman, and not just Mr. Leissner and Mr. Ng, had known about promises to pay bribes to secure 1MDB business. The document also described another Goldman executive as a co-conspirator in the bribery scheme. This person, The New York Times reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter, was Andrea Vella, who was most recently co-head of investment banking in Asia for Goldman. Mr. Vella was suspended by the bank last month. His lawyer declined to comment. And in his plea hearing, Mr. Leissner told the court that his efforts to conceal facts from the bank's compliance and legal employees were ""very much in the culture of Goldman Sachs."" But Mr. Leissner did not expand on his assertion about Goldman's culture in the redacted court transcript containing that remark. And it's important that the government has not charged Mr. Vella. If prosecutors charge no one from Goldman besides Mr. Leissner and Mr. Ng, the bank's ""a couple of bad apples"" defense may gain ground. The degree of punishment exacted by the Justice Department could influence other lawsuits against Goldman Sachs. Take the possibility that the government and Goldman enter into a deferred prosecution agreement. Under such an agreement, the Justice Department files charges against a firm but asks that they be postponed while the firm take steps to address prosecutors' concerns. In Goldman's case, it might have to agree to revamp parts of its compliance program. Particularly crucial in deferred prosecution agreements is the ""statement of facts,"" which describes the criminal activity and contains detailed evidence of wrongdoing. If Goldman ended up agreeing to a deferred prosecution agreement, the statement of facts could bolster lawsuits brought by two government investment funds from Abu Dhabi that played a role in 1MDB bond deals, said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit and a DealBook columnist. ""We are in the process of assessing the details of allegations and fully expect to contest the claim vigorously,"" Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, said in an email, referring to the Abu Dhabi lawsuit. Of course, Goldman's lawyers can be expected to push for a nonprosecution agreement instead. The statement of facts with such an agreement would most likely be softer."

After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates — often a reason for investors to sell stocks — the markets kept climbing. As some of the world's largest economies began to slow down, American markets largely shrugged it off. Not anymore. Last week, elements of all of those combined to drive the S&P 500-stock index down by 4.6 percent, its worst weekly drop since March and one marked by stomach-churning price swings. Stocks are now down 1.5 percent this year. [Read more: Stocks have wiped out their gains for 2018, but if you look back to the recovery since the recession, they're still riding high.] More volatility could be in store, as investors assess the allegations by prosecutors that President Trump directed illegal payments to ward off a potential sex scandal, and the possibility that he sought to secretly do business in Russia during his 2016 campaign for the White House. The arrest of a prominent Chinese technology executive, meanwhile, has added new strains to the relationship between Washington and Beijing, which face a March deadline to reach a trade deal. On Sunday, China summoned the American ambassador in Beijing to protest the arrest, while Robert Lighthizer, who is leading the trade talks with China, said he considered March 1 to be a ""a hard deadline"" for the negotiations. ""Every eye is going to be focused on every piece of commentary on this trade deal,"" said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, which manages over $6 trillion in assets. ""Because the impact on growth is so significant."" While the large market swings on trade-related news underscore some investors' view that a resolution to the impasse between the United States and China will be crucial to the survival of the economic expansion, there are other political and economic risks as well. They include the fallout from the special counsel's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, the relentless staff churn in the Trump administration, the efforts to negotiate Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, and social unrest in France. ""The fact is that politics is driving the economy to an extent that is very atypical,"" said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, an institutional brokerage firm. ""We would say probably to the greatest extent that we've seen in our investing lifetime."" Last week, markets whipsawed on headlines related to the trade war. On Monday, stocks jumped 1.1 percent on word that President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had agreed to a 90-day halt on any new tariffs to provide space to negotiate key trade issues. The next day, the S&P dove 3.2 percent, as the president, calling himself ""a Tariff Man"" in a Twitter message, seemed to reignite the standoff. Markets were closed on Wednesday for the state funeral for former President George Bush, but as soon as trading resumed on Thursday, stocks dropped as much as 2.9 percent after news that Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese electronics giant Huawei and the elder daughter of its founder, had been detained in Canada at the request of the United States. Then, late in the day, the markets recovered most of those losses on hopes that the Federal Reserve could slow its plan to raise interest rates next year. But they still ended the day lower. The selling continued on Friday, when stocks fell 2.3 percent. The trade war has already taken a toll on large chunks of the global economy. China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, is growing at its slowest rate in nearly a decade. The export-driven economies of Japan and Germany — the third and fourth biggest economies in the world, respectively — both contracted in the third quarter. The United States has so far been an outlier. Thanks in part to a burst of deficit-fueled stimulus, a large chunk from the tax cut, the American economy this year is on track to grow at its fastest pace since 2005. The national unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, a near 50-year low. Corporate profits and wages are growing at their fastest pace in years. For much of 2018, results like that helped Wall Street stand out even as major stock benchmarks around the globe tumbled. Chinese stocks are down more than 20 percent this year, and shares in Germany are down 16.5 percent. In Japan, stocks are down about 5 percent, and in Britain they're down more than 10 percent. But even in the United States, there are emerging pockets of weakness, particularly in parts of the economy that are sensitive to rising borrowing costs. Pending home sales have declined for eight straight months, as interest rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have climbed. Monthly auto sales have plateaued, prompting job cuts at General Motors and Ford. Worries about global economic growth, trade and the strength of corporate America have been battering stocks. While that's cause for concern, it is important to put slides like this in context. The stock market has mirrored those concerns since the summer. Shares of carmakers and auto-parts manufacturers are down more than 25 percent this year. Shares of homebuilders have slumped nearly 30 percent. And investors are growing more concerned about the outlook for corporate profits next year, despite third-quarter results that showed that profits at S&P 500 companies rose at the fastest pace since 2010. Instead of the strong results, investors zeroed in on commentary from executives about whether next year might signal the beginning of the end for the second-longest business cycle expansion on record. ""We're very mindful once again where we're at in the cycle,"" Gregory Carmichael, chief executive of the Cincinnati-based lender Fifth Third, said at a conference last week. ""We're well positioned to deal with the downturn in the economy, and we'll be very cautious."" That very caution from corporate America could itself sway the economy, should lenders pull back financing, or large businesses slow their growth plans. There are other risks to the economy, too, and high on many investors' lists of these is the Federal Reserve. The central bank has been raising interest rates and winding down other financial crisis-era stimulus that helped drive a global investment boom over the past decade. These higher rates pinch stock investors by making government debt a more appealing alternative, particularly in uncertain times, and also mean companies that binged on low-cost loans will have to spend more to cover their obligations. Many analysts date the start of October's brutal sell-off for stocks — they dropped 6.9 percent — on comments from the Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, in early October that seemed to indicate that the Fed planned to raise rates more aggressively than the market had expected. In late November, though, Mr. Powell sent stocks surging when he said the Fed's benchmark interest rate was ""just below"" the neutral level. The markets took those remarks as a sign that the central bank might not be as aggressive in raising rates as they initially thought. The market tumult, coupled with the increasingly uncertain path for the global economy, is part of the reason Mr. Rieder, of BlackRock, said he believed that the Fed might decide not to lift interest rates at its next meeting on Dec. 18-19. ""The Fed should slow down and now take a step back and look at what has happened,"" he said."
News,2018-12-10,"TOKYO — Prosecutors in Japan on Monday indicted Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of Nissan Motor, and the auto company itself on charges that they had violated financial laws by underreporting Mr. Ghosn’s compensation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/business/nissan-carlos-ghosn-indicted.html,623," TOKYO — Prosecutors in Japan on Monday indicted Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of Nissan Motor, and the auto company itself on charges that they had violated financial laws by underreporting Mr. Ghosn's compensation. Mr. Ghosn, once among the auto industry's most respected executives, was arrested three weeks ago by the Japanese authorities. The allegations have upended a carmaking empire that includes Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors in Japan and Renault in France. In addition to the formal charges announced Monday, which cover allegations related to actions from 2011 to 2015, the authorities rearrested Mr. Ghosn on similar charges stemming from a subsequent period. Mr. Ghosn, 64, has been held in detention in Tokyo since his arrest on Nov. 19. Motonari Otsuru, a lawyer for Mr. Ghosn, could not immediately be reached for comment. In response to the indictment, Nissan said in a statement that it would strengthen its compliance efforts. It did not deny the charges. ""Nissan takes this situation extremely seriously,"" the statement said. ""Making false disclosures in annual securities reports greatly harms the integrity of Nissan's public disclosures in the securities markets, and the company expresses its deepest regret."" On Tuesday, a Tokyo court approved keeping Mr. Ghosn in detention until Dec. 20. Prosecutors also indicted Greg Kelly, a former Nissan human resources manager and a member of the company's board. Mr. Kelly, through his lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, has denied wrongdoing. Mr. Kelly, like Mr. Ghosn, was rearrested Monday, on allegations that he helped Mr. Ghosn underreport his compensation. Nissan has said it uncovered misconduct by Mr. Ghosn that included underreporting his compensation and using company funds for personal expenses. In a news conference held the night Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly were initially arrested, Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan's chief executive, said Mr. Kelly ""has been determined to be the mastermind of this matter, together with Carlos Ghosn."" According to the indictment, Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly understated Mr. Ghosn's earnings from 2011 to 2015 by half in securities filings: 4.99 billion yen ($44.3 million) compared with 9.86 billion yen ($88.4 million), including bonuses. Nissan was indicted on charges of having misstated Mr. Ghosn's compensation in filings with the financial authorities. Nissan, which conducted an internal inquiry into the alleged financial underreporting, removed Mr. Ghosn as chairman shortly after he was arrested and removed Mr. Kelly as executive director. Mr. Ghosn was also removed from a similar position at Mitsubishi Motors. He remains chairman of Renault, but the French company has appointed Thierry Bolloré, its chief operating officer, to assume Mr. Ghosn's day-to-day responsibilities. In a new arrest warrant issued Monday, Tokyo prosectors said Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly conspired to understate Mr. Ghosn's pay in securities filings from June 2016 to June 2018. In the fillings, Mr. Ghosn's compensation for the period was reported as 2.9 billion yen ($25.7 million). Prosecutors said they were investigating allegations that Mr. Ghosn was actually paid 7.17 billion yen ($63.6 million). Prosecutors have yet to address allegations contained in Nissan's internal report that Mr. Ghosn misused company funds for personal use. A Nissan spokesman confirmed that the company had barred Mr. Ghosn's family from a home the company bought for him in Rio de Janeiro. ""We believe that they would attempt to remove or destroy evidence,"" said Nicholas Maxfield, a Nissan spokesman at the company's headquarters in Yokohama. ""And some of that evidence would be fairly incriminating."" Legal experts in Japan said it was common for prosecutors to indict companies alongside individuals in financial crime cases. ""In this case it makes perfect sense,"" said David Litt, a professor at Keio University Law School in Tokyo. ""It would have been very hard for him to hide this without a number of people in the company knowing about it."""

News,2018-12-10,"LONDON — Britain’s embattled Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday postponed a critical parliamentary vote on her proposal for Britain’s departure from the European Union, a humiliating retreat that left the country’s economic and political future uncertain, and revealed her tenuous hold on power.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/world/europe/uk-brexit-ecj.html,1292," LONDON — Britain's embattled Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday postponed a critical parliamentary vote on her proposal for Britain's departure from the European Union, a humiliating retreat that left the country's economic and political future uncertain, and revealed her tenuous hold on power. British lawmakers had been scheduled to vote on Tuesday on the agreement Mrs. May had reached with the bloc for Britain's withdrawal, or Brexit. In changing course so late, Mrs. May has left the country without any clear way forward after an agonizing battle over an issue that has gripped British society for nearly three years. The question facing the United Kingdom remains as straightforward — and yet as divisive — as it was when a small but clear majority of voters called for breaking with the European Union: Is it possible to have a smooth and orderly divorce from Europe that will not cause a sudden break in all political and economic ties, and also spare the British economy? [What is Brexit? A simple guide to why it matters and what happens next.] The answer, for now, seems to be a resounding no. And the country's future is as uncertain as ever. But the opposition to her plan is also a rebuke to Mrs. May herself. After years of talking the talk of a hard-liner, insisting that no deal was better than a bad deal, Mrs. May showed up with a compromise that seemed to anger everyone on all sides of the debate. While a strong prime minister with reserves of political capital might also find it impossible to escape the political quicksand that is Brexit, Mrs. May has few allies even among her own party and is facing constant speculation that she could confront a no-confidence vote. She is hanging on only because her party cannot agree on an alternative. In this reality, no plan and political paralysis means Britain could be staring at a hard break on March 29. That would mean that suddenly, in one dramatic moment, Britain's time would run out and it would lose much of its economic and political links to Europe. Banking, trade, travel, the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland — all would possibly change overnight. With the news of the postponed vote, the British pound lost about 1 percent of its value against the euro and the United States dollar, falling to its lowest level in more than a year and a half. Responding to news of the delayed vote, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's representative in the Brexit negotiations, wrote on Twitter, ""I can't follow anymore."" ""This delay will further aggravate the uncertainty for people & businesses,"" he wrote. ""It's time they make up their mind!"" Mrs. May told lawmakers she would resume talks with the European Union over their sticking points. But European leaders have said they will not renegotiate. ""If we went ahead and held the vote tomorrow the deal would be rejected by a significant margin,"" Mrs. May told Parliament, adding that she wished to defer the vote ""and not proceed to divide the House at this time."" Yet, by opting to try to enter more negotiations, both before and at a summit meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, Mrs. May effectively has placed her fate in their hands. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said Mrs. May's government had ""lost control of events and is in complete disarray."" Almost every major cabinet minister and some less senior figures are being mentioned as a possible leader or jockeying for position. The opposition to Mrs. May's plan had crystallized largely over objections to contingency plans for dealing with the Irish border that pro-Brexit lawmakers say could potentially leave the United Kingdom tied to some of the bloc's rules. Presently, Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, are within the European Union and there are no customs or other regulatory checks on goods passing between them. That could change after Brexit, or not. Mrs. May's plan, for example, could mean the whole of the United Kingdom would be part of a European-wide customs union. But Brexit supporters fear that could leave the United Kingdom indefinitely tied to many European rules. Lawmakers themselves, though, do not agree on an alternative to Mrs. May's proposal. Some would prefer a Brexit plan that might keep closer ties to the European Union, while others hope to reverse the whole process by holding a second referendum. European Union officials have insisted that Mrs. May's deal, reached last month after lengthy negotiations, is their final offer. ""The Brexit withdrawal agreement is the only deal on the table between the E.U. and the U.K. and is not open to renegotiation,"" the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, declared. What Mrs. May seems to be angling for is a formal declaration or assurance from the European Union that the plan for the Irish border — keeping it open for the flow of goods — will not be permanent. The president of the European Union, Donald Tusk, extended an olive branch of sorts on Monday, writing on Twitter that although the bloc ""will not renegotiate the deal,"" it would ""discuss how to facilitate U.K. ratification"" while also discussing preparations for ""a no-deal scenario."" Mrs. May acknowledged that ""there remains widespread and deep concern"" over plans for the Irish border. But she insisted that her plan was ""the best deal that can be negotiated."" She said she wanted to win more assurances from Brussels to help sell her proposal to skeptical lawmakers. Most analysts believe that European leaders are highly unlikely to reopen the 585-page, legally binding withdrawal deal. And so Monday's move could simply delay the inevitable reckoning over an agreement that has united significant numbers of lawmakers of different views in their opposition. Steve Baker, a member of the European Research Group, an alliance of pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers, said postponing the vote would amount to ""essentially a defeat"" of Mrs. May's agreement with the European Union. The terms of the agreement ""were so bad that they didn't dare put it to Parliament for a vote,"" he said on Twitter. ""This isn't the mark of a stable government or a strong plan."" Mrs. May did not say when she wants to hold a new vote on her plan. Her only hope, a slim one, is that some new declaration from Brussels — or, perhaps, a scary drop in the pound or the financial markets — will persuade her rebel lawmakers to fall into line. The financial effects of the uncertainty are being felt already. As the pound sterling fell on the international currency markets, Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry warned that ""unless a deal is agreed quickly, the country risks sliding toward a national crisis."" Mrs. May's announcement came hours after the European Union's highest court ruled that Britain could legally cancel its decision to leave the bloc and remain under its current terms, throwing a lifeline to those who still hope to reverse the withdrawal. The decision, from the European Court of Justice, confirmed a recommendation last week by one of the court's senior legal advisers. Mrs. May started the two-year exit process under Article 50 of the European Union's treaty in March 2017. She has vowed to carry out the will of voters, who narrowly approved withdrawal from the union in a 2016 referendum. But the European Court ruled that Britain could withdraw its Article 50 submission before the March 29 withdrawal date, as long as it did so in accordance with the country's democratic and constitutional arrangements, and communicated the decision in writing. The reversal would not require the approval of the 27 other member countries, the court said."
News,2018-12-10,"Americans are generally uncomfortable with pharmaceutical prices — which are the highest for brand drugs among wealthy nations — and with drug companies’ profits. But if policies were adopted to reduce drug prices, could there be negative consequences? On balance, would such policies be good or bad?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/upshot/how-to-cut-drug-prices-experts-weigh-in.html,1289," Americans are generally uncomfortable with pharmaceutical prices — which are the highest for brand drugs among wealthy nations — and with drug companies' profits. But if policies were adopted to reduce drug prices, could there be negative consequences? On balance, would such policies be good or bad? I asked three health policy experts to consider these questions in the context of four specific drug pricing policies. Most Americans, including those on Medicare, get drug coverage from private insurers, which negotiate prices with drug manufacturers. (Insurers often outsource that task to pharmacy benefit management companies.) In a competitive market, insurers that drive the hardest bargains should be able to reduce premiums and cost-sharing. That would then attract more people to enroll, increasing insurers' revenue. But ""consumers turn out to be fairly bad at shopping and do not respond to price decreases,"" said Fiona Scott Morton, an economist at the Yale School of Management. She was an author of a study showing that consumers in Medicare tend to stick with whatever plans they originally selected, even as premiums rise. Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said: ""A key disadvantage of Medicare's drug benefit is that it has no real system in place for holding down drug prices. Drug manufacturers with monopoly products can raise prices to whatever extent the market will bear."" Medicare rules that require insurance plans to cover all drugs in certain classes, including for cancer, help undermine plans' ability to negotiate prices downward. Medicare ""can't walk away from the table"" and refuse to cover a drug, he said. Nicholas Bagley, a professor of law at the University of Michigan, pointed out that for many drugs — most commonly, generics — competition has lowered prices. ""But for drugs that lack clinical substitutes — including some patented drugs and complex biologics — competition doesn't work,"" he said. This is by design. Patents that the government provides to drug companies necessarily create monopolies. Therefore ""we need another solution if we want private plans to get lower prices,"" Mr. Bagley said. Medicare could flex its market power by negotiating directly with drug manufacturers. There have been calls for Medicare to do so, and polling shows that a majority of Americans favor it. Other government programs, including Medicaid and the Department of Veterans Affairs, obtain steeper discounts than Medicare drug plans. In part this is because of government regulations that mandate price reductions. But those programs also negotiate directly with manufacturers, obtaining additional discounts. For example, the V.A. pays about 40 percent less for drugs than Medicare drug plans do. ""The V.A. obtains larger discounts in part because it can — and does — institute a more restrictive formulary than Medicare, meaning some drugs that are more costly but no better than alternatives are not as easily obtained in the V.A. as they are from a Medicare plan,"" Dr. Kesselheim said. Ms. Scott Morton said: ""Direct negotiation by Medicare would only be effective if it could say, 'No, we won't cover your product' to a drug manufacturer. Is that really plausible? I'm not sure that's what Medicare beneficiaries would want."" Medicare could save money if it could negotiate with manufacturers and exclude high-priced drugs. That would benefit taxpayers, but it would mean reduced access to drugs for the program's current beneficiaries and slower innovation of drugs in the future. ""If Medicare doesn't pay attention to a drug's benefits during those negotiations, the pharmaceutical industry won't have the right incentives to develop the drugs we need most,"" Mr. Bagley said. One way to better align a drug price with its clinical value is to follow the lead of other countries. Some simply refuse to pay if a drug is considered too expensive relative to the benefits it delivers. In Britain, for example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises the country's National Health Service about which drugs to cover. The institute considers a drug's cost-effectiveness, as well as the type of condition it addresses and whether it's for a particularly vulnerable population. There's more leeway for drugs administered toward the end of life, for example. Drug manufactures have cut prices to get their products covered in Britain. In April 2014, NICE initially did not recommend Eli Lilly's lung cancer drug Alimta on cost-effectiveness grounds. But when Eli Lilly dropped Alimta's price, it gained NICE's approval. ""If we stopped covering drugs that are 1 percent better but 1,000 percent more expensive, drug manufacturers would steer their research investments toward more effective drugs,"" Mr. Bagley said. ""The obstacle is political."" Ms. Scott Morton said: ""The main reason we do not have a NICE-like system in the U.S. is that drug manufacturers lose when insurers know which drug is most cost-effective. It is in pharma's interest to protect their profits and lobby vigorously against any government body that would reveal which drugs have the highest value.""  Another consideration, according to Dr. Kesselheim: ""We still might be willing to pay a lot for extremely effective new drugs."" That is, if we're willing to pay according to value, some very high-value medications will command very high prices. ""A system with less wasteful drug spending for many other conditions should be able to better afford high prices in those circumstances,"" he said. There is a more nuanced variation on Britain's take-it-or-leave-it approach. An insurer or public program could use information about the price-benefit trade-off to establish not whether to cover a drug, but how generously. The insurer or program could make a drug more accessible by cutting cost-sharing or by clearing away administrative hurdles. Often, for a lower price, insurers are more willing to provide easier access, which increases sales of that drug — a trade-off of volume for price. This happened with the cholesterol medication Praluent, made by Regeneron and Sanofi and approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015. It was originally priced at $14,000 per year. At that price, the pharmacy benefit management firm Express Scripts — which manages drug benefits for 85 million consumers — covered the drug only if a patient went through a complex review process. In March 2018, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review estimated that a cost-effective price for the drug would be, at most, $8,000 per year for high-risk patients. In exchange for more favorable coverage by Express Scripts, Regeneron and Sanofi agreed this year to lower the price of Praluent to the level the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review recommended. More patients will have access to the drug, and it will cost insurers less per patient than originally priced. ""This kind of value-based insurance design is the holy grail, at least for new drugs,"" Mr. Bagley said. ""But we wouldn't want to pay a value-based price for aspirin. Doing so would cause us to pay a lot more for it than we do today."" Dr. Kesselheim said: ""One reason imposing higher cost-sharing on less effective drugs isn't as successful as it could be today is that drug manufacturers undermine the approach. They offer coupons to patients that counteract increased cost-sharing levels or provide physician offices with strategies to circumvent prior authorization paperwork."" ""Drug manufacturers offering financial assistance is an illegal kickback in Medicare,"" Ms. Scott Morton said. ""We would likely lower drug costs by extending that rule to the private sector."" Ultimately, all these approaches have limitations. ""There isn't one best model for drug pricing,"" Mr. Bagley said. ""What works for generics won't work for patented drugs, and we shouldn't pay for antibiotics the same way that we pay for cancer drugs."" That's why it's hard to boil realistic solutions down to a bumper-sticker slogan. Balancing prices and access to drugs for the patients of today with the innovation that will benefit those of tomorrow will take ingenuity, as well as a lot of political will."
News,2018-12-10,"Wall Street fought its way back from early losses on Monday, as another volatile day of trading highlighted investors’ unease about the global economy and corporate profits.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/business/global-markets-wall-street.html,721," Wall Street fought its way back from early losses on Monday, as another volatile day of trading highlighted investors' unease about the global economy and corporate profits. After slipping by nearly 2 percent in the morning, the S&P 500 finished the day 0.2 percent higher. Markets in Europe and Asia, however, ended Monday in the red. Technology stocks led the rebound on Wall Street, and trading in Apple illustrated the upswing. Apple shares fell as much as 2 percent early Monday, after a Chinese court said the company had infringed on two Qualcomm patents and must stop selling seven of its most popular iPhones in the country. But the shares recovered, up 0.7 percent at the close, after Apple said that it was still selling all iPhone models in China and that it had filed a request for ""reconsideration"" with the court. Among other technology stocks, Microsoft shares climbed 2.6 percent and Facebook rose more than 3 percent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 0.7 percent. Worries about global economic growth, trade and the strength of corporate America have been battering stocks. While that's cause for concern, it is important to put slides like this in context. Shares of companies that manufacture weapons and military technology also rose, after reports that the Trump administration will propose an increase in military spending. Northrop Grumman stock gained nearly 5 percent, while Raytheon shares added more than 3.6 percent. Volatility has tormented stock investors in recent days, as they assess the impact of a trade war that is grinding on and has the potential to slow the global economy. Market watchers cautioned against reading too much into the upturn on Monday. ""The tendency is to look at days like today as a major trend shift,"" said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm. ""Usually, going forward, they don't really add up or amount to much."" One trigger for the early decline on Monday was the news that Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, facing a certain defeat in Parliament, would seek to delay the vote on a deal for her nation's exit from the European Union. British lawmakers had been expected to vote on the plan on Tuesday. Should Parliament reject her plan, Mrs. May might have to call for a new referendum on the issue or a new general election. In London, the FTSE 100 dropped about 0.8 percent. The pound also fell against the dollar, hitting its lowest level since April 2017. [Read more about Wall Street's remarkable turn.] Economic data released on Monday also provided investors with more evidence of a slowdown among export-based economies. Figures from Japan showed that the country's economy shrank more in the third quarter than initially reported, and data from China revealed a sharp slowdown in trade last month. Energy producers, meanwhile, tumbled along with crude oil prices. Exxon Mobil shares fell 1.4 percent. Financial stocks also fared poorly. Although stocks have been falling since late September, the arrest of a prominent Chinese technology executive seemed to raise the stakes for investors last week. On Monday, a bail hearing for the executive, Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, resumed in Vancouver, British Columbia. United States authorities are accusing Ms. Meng of fraud and participating in a scheme to trick financial institutions into making transactions that violated American sanctions against Iran. [Read more: The Huawei executive's arrest is igniting fear. The U.S. should take notice.] Over the weekend, China summoned Terry Branstad, the United States ambassador, to protest the arrest. Ms. Meng was detained in Canada at the behest of American authorities. Her detention coincided with an important meeting between President Xi Jinping of China and President Trump during which the two agreed to a 90-day truce in the trade war. In a sign that investors were less worried about the situation, semiconductor companies, which rely on supply chains in Asia and have become a barometer of investor sentiment about United States-China relations, rose on Monday. Advanced Micro Devices, for example, rose 2.7 percent. But China is just one of several worries investors are fixated on. Others are rising interest rates and already sluggish sectors of the American economy, like housing and autos. ""Investors are focused on a lot of these walls of worry that are out there,"" said Michael Gibbs, director of portfolio and technical strategy at the brokerage firm Raymond James in Memphis. ""Until we get some clarity on some of those, the market's going to continue to struggle."""

Here's the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with a look at the wild swings in the stock market, President Trump's search for a new chief of staff, and a major investigation into the sale of users' smartphone data. Global stocks are down today, and investors could face more stock swings in the days ahead, after the S&P 500-stock index fell more than 4.6 percent last week, its worst weekly drop since March. A trade truce between the U.S. and China has already come under strain over the arrest of a prominent Chinese technology executive. Markets in Asia closed lower today; European stocks also fell. If you missed it yesterday: China summoned the U.S. ambassador to Beijing to protest the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei. Separately, Robert Lighthizer, who is leading trade talks, said he considered March 1 to be a ""a hard deadline"" for the negotiations. President Trump is looking for a new chief of staff, after announcing over the weekend that John Kelly would leave at the end of the year. Nick Ayers, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence and a leading contender to replace Mr. Kelly, said on Sunday that he would leave the administration at the end of the year. Looking ahead: Among the possible candidates are Representative Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican; the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin; Mr. Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney; and the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. Catch up: Mr. Trump said on Friday that he would nominate William Barr, who served as attorney general in the first Bush administration, to lead the Justice Department again. The president also confirmed that he would nominate Heather Nauert, a former ""Fox & Friends"" host,  to replace Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United Nations. After recommending a substantial prison term for President Trump's former lawyer, federal prosecutors are turning their attention to other Trump Organization executives and to what they might have known about crimes committed in connection with the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Cohen, who pleaded guilty in August to breaking campaign finance laws and other crimes, is to be sentenced on Wednesday. Prosecutors have accused Mr. Trump of directing illegal payments to ward off a possible sex scandal that could have damaged his chances of winning the election. Closer look: Prosecutors said Mr. Cohen offered only ""selective cooperation"" in the case, which is separate from the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. From Opinion: The sentencing memos filed on Friday suggest that Mr. Trump and others might have been involved in lies told by Mr. Cohen and Paul Manafort, a New York University law professor writes.

But another — in which laureates are awakened at the Grand Hotel Stockholm by young women in white carrying candles — may be fading into history. The ceremony reflects a Swedish custom honoring St. Lucia, who represents the triumph of light over darkness.

News,2018-12-10,"HONG KONG — Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, fresh off a silent-meditation retreat in Myanmar, was so smitten with his visit that he posted a series of glowing tweets about the country and its people, urging others to travel there.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/world/asia/twitter-jack-dorsey-myanmar-rohingya.html,864," HONG KONG — Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, fresh off a silent-meditation retreat in Myanmar, was so smitten with his visit that he posted a series of glowing tweets about the country and its people, urging others to travel there. But his posts on Sunday were called out by many on Twitter for not mentioning the plight of the Rohingya, a mostly Muslim minority group that has faced a ruthless campaign of violence and persecution at the hands of Myanmar's military that caused hundreds of thousands to flee. Mr. Dorsey now faces a backlash from critics who described his travel missives — which included a description of how he used his Apple Watch in airplane mode to track his heart rate during meditation and rest — as politically tone deaf. Strange combination of tone deafness, virtue signalling & naïveté in someone so powerful as tweeter in chief. Maybe keep your inner journeys to yourself in future? ""Is this satire?"" one person asked on Twitter. ""Please be satire."" The criticism of Mr. Dorsey echoes a debate that once swirled among Western travelers during the years Myanmar was ruled by a repressive military junta — a debate that mostly subsided after 2012 elections brought the country's Nobel Prize-winning dissident, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and her party into office for the first time. But today's debate over the ethics of visiting Myanmar is different. First, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who while a political prisoner once asked foreign tourists to boycott her country, is now the civilian leader of a government whose ruthless military campaign against the Rohingya has broad popular support from Myanmar's ethnic Bamar Buddhist majority. Before 2012, it could still be argued ""that to ignore the boycott by visiting Myanmar, you were lending important financial support to ordinary people who were not involved in the junta and were largely innocent of any moral wrongdoing,"" said Stuart McDonald, a co-founder of Travelfish, a travel website covering Southeast Asia. ""Today, that doesn't really hold,"" he said, ""as the actions against specifically the Rohingya, but also the Muslim minority population in general, enjoy a degree of popular support within the general population."" More than 720,000 Rohingya fled slaughter, rape and village burnings last year in western Myanmar, where many of their families had lived for generations. One result is the transformation of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the country's civilian leader, from democracy icon to an enabler of what the United Nations calls ethnic cleaning and a foe of the free press. Myanmar has denied that its military committed atrocities against the Rohingya, saying it was merely responding to attacks by Rohingya militants. But United Nations experts said in August, echoing reporting by human rights groups, that top Myanmar generals should face trial in an international court for genocide against the Rohingya and crimes against humanity targeting other ethnic minorities. In addition to physical violence, Myanmar military personnel turned Facebook into a tool for ethnic cleansing to target the Rohingya, according to former officials and other experts. Facebook acknowledged last month that it had failed to prevent its platform from being used to ""foment division and incite offline violence"" in Myanmar. How all of that will ultimately affect Myanmar's tourism industry — which has generally boomed since 2012 — is unclear. But year-on-year visitor arrivals of American and Canadian travelers in Myanmar were down nearly 15 percent through September, and more than 26 percent for visitors from Western Europe, according to government figures. People working in Myanmar's travel industry said in interviews on Monday that they attributed the slump to concerns about the military's treatment of the Rohingya. But tourist arrivals were up nearly 34 percent for Chinese travelers in the same period, and more than 10 percent for those from Asia as a whole, government figures show. Several in the tourism industry said that an overall rise in the number of Asian visitors made them optimistic about future prospects. ""If three million Westerners don't want to come, then three million easterners will come,"" said U Win Zaw Oo, the chairman of the Mandalay Tourist Guide Society. ""Our country will not be ruined as Westerners want it to be. We can manage."" Renaud Egreteau, the author of ""Caretaking Democratization: The Military and Political Change in Myanmar,"" said he doubted that a new era of tourism boycotts could force Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, to show more empathy toward ethnic and religious minorities generally, or Rohingya in particular. Mr. Egreteau said one reason was that boycotting specific tourist attractions or practicing so-called ethical tourism — in which tourists choose to minimize their negative impacts on local culture, politics or the environment — had become more popular than ""broadly shunning holidays to the country."" Vicky Bowman, the director of the Myanmar Center for Responsible Business, said that much effort had been made recently to develop ""sustainable, culture-focused and community-based tourism offerings"" in the country, and that such initiatives would fold if affluent Westerners chose not to visit. After posting the tweets about his trip, Mr. Dorsey said he would be happy to answer questions about his experience in Myanmar, but as of late Sunday in California, he had not responded to criticism of his tweets. Kate Hayes, the policy communications manager for Twitter in the Asia-Pacific region, declined to comment."
News,2018-12-11,"A four-foot bronze statue of a girl sporting a defiant look on her face appeared in Lower Manhattan on the eve of International Women’s Day in March 2017. The sculpture soon became known as the Fearless Girl, captivating New Yorkers and tourists alike.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/nyregion/fearless-girl-statue-stock-exchange-.html,772," A four-foot bronze statue of a girl sporting a defiant look on her face appeared in Lower Manhattan on the eve of International Women's Day in March 2017. The sculpture soon became known as the Fearless Girl, captivating New Yorkers and tourists alike. On Monday, the Fearless Girl did as most New York transplants do after their first year in the city: She moved to more permanent digs, several blocks north, opposite the New York Stock Exchange. ""We are welcoming her with open arms,"" Betty Liu, executive vice chairwoman of the exchange, which appointed its first female president in 226 years in May, said in an interview on Monday. The 250-pound statue was commissioned by State Street Global Advisors, a Boston-based financial firm, and placed in front of the Charging Bull sculpture on Wall Street last year to draw attention to ""the power of women in leadership."" ""She can have an even bigger stage to make an even bigger impact,"" Cyrus Taraporevala, the firm's chief executive, said on Monday at the unveiling of the statue at its new home. The Fearless Girl sculpture attracted immediate attention last year, with admirers snapping and sharing photos, as well as making pleas for it to become a permanent fixture. But the sculpture also drew backlash, with critics calling it an act of ""corporate feminism"" and a ""marketing coup."" [Sign up here for the Gender Letter, our newsletter that helps you keep up with the world, and the women shaping it.] Months later, the firm's parent company, State Street Corporation, agreed to pay $5 million mostly to settle claims that it discriminated against 305 top female employees by paying them less than men in the same positions. In the agreement, officials at the United States Labor Department also alleged that State Street discriminated against 15 black vice presidents by paying them less than white employees in the same positions. (State Street Corporation's website currently lists three women on its 11-member board of directors.) As tourists and New Yorkers flocked to the Fearless Girl statue over the last year and a half, posing in similar power stances, the large crowds became a safety issue. In April, city officials announced her move to a location near the exchange, an area already heavily restricted to traffic, where large numbers of pedestrians but few cars pass through. ""I am thrilled Fearless Girl will remain in New York,"" Kristen Visbal, the statue's sculptor, said in a statement released by City Hall in April. Now there is a plaque where she used to stand in Bowling Green, near the bull sculpture, whose creator, Arturo Di Modica, had been vocal about his displeasure with the Fearless Girl. But the bull may not be there for long, if the city has its way. A city official said on Monday that the Charging Bull sculpture would eventually move close to the New York Stock Exchange, but it was unclear exactly where. For Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has posed for pictures with the Fearless Girl statue, it was important to keep the two sculptures together. ""I've been profoundly struck by what this statue means in particular to women, and to girls in this city, and this whole country,"" Mr. de Blasio said weeks after the statue was placed downtown. ""I think there's an even broader symbolism of standing up to fear, standing up to power, being able to find in yourself the strength to do what's right."" On Monday, Mr. de Blasio said in a statement that the city was ""proud to be home to the Fearless Girl."" ""She is a powerful symbol of the need for change at the highest levels of corporate America — and she will become a durable part of our city's civic life,"" he said. ""This move to a new location will improve access for visitors and ensure that her message and impact continues to be heard."" If the bull sculpture follows the Fearless Girl statue to the New York Exchange, it would be a return of sorts for the bull. Thirty years ago, Mr. Di Modica placed the Charging Bull in front of the exchange in the middle of the night. The bull was then moved to its current location after the police saw its original placement as a traffic obstruction. (Mr. Di Modica could not be reached for comment on Monday.)

News,2018-12-11,"WASHINGTON — On a July evening, Trump administration officials and allies, including the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, gathered with investors atop the Hay-Adams hotel overlooking the White House for a cocktail reception featuring a short presentation by the Democratic Republic of Congo’s special envoy to the United States.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/us/politics/sanctions-lobbyists-usa.html,1726," WASHINGTON — On a July evening, Trump administration officials and allies, including the president's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, gathered with investors atop the Hay-Adams hotel overlooking the White House for a cocktail reception featuring a short presentation by the Democratic Republic of Congo's special envoy to the United States. An invitation for the reception billed it as an opportunity to learn about ""the role Africa plays in gaining access to critical minerals, such as cobalt"" and to discuss ""the strategic relationship"" between the United States and the nations of Africa. In fact, the reception was part of an aggressive $8 million lobbying and public relations campaign that used lobbyists with ties to the Trump administration to try to ease concerns about the Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, whose government was facing threats of additional sanctions from the Trump administration for human rights abuses and corruption. The lavish cocktail party was one example of a lucrative and expanding niche within Washington's influence industry. As President Trump's administration has increasingly turned to sanctions, travel restrictions and tariffs to punish foreign governments as well as people and companies from abroad, targets of those measures have turned for assistance to Washington's K Street corridor of law, lobbying and public relations firms. The work can carry reputational and legal risks, since clients often come with toxic baggage and the United States Treasury Department restricts transactions with entities under sanctions. As a result, it commands some of the biggest fees of any sector in the influence industry. And some of the biggest payments have been going to lobbyists, lawyers and consultants with connections to Mr. Trump or his administration. ""People overseas often want to hear that you know so-and-so, and can make a call to solve their problem,"" said Erich Ferrari, a leading Washington sanctions lawyer who said he has tried to disabuse prospective clients of such notions. It is a perception that matches up with the pay-to-play mind-set that defines politics in many parts of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the former Soviet states. As politicians and executives from those regions have increasingly been targeted by sanctions, they have sought to apply that approach — backed by huge sums of cash — to navigating Washington, lobbyists and former government officials say. This has been encouraged, they say, by the willingness projected by Mr. Trump and his team to make deals around sanctions and tariffs exemptions. Previous administrations had worked to wall off politics from those processes, which are supposed to be overseen primarily by career officials and governed by strict legal analyses. In June, after a personal intervention by Mr. Trump, the Commerce Department rescinded sanctions that could have crippled the Chinese technology giant ZTE, which had fought the sanctions through an intense three-month lobbying push that cost $1.4 million. A $108,500-a-month lobbying campaign has helped delay the imposition of sanctions against an industrial conglomerate owned by the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Among the leaders of the lobbying efforts for both ZTE and Mr. Deripaska's companies was Bryan Lanza, a former Trump campaign aide who maintains close ties to administration officials. His firm, Mercury Public Affairs, has signed other clients facing punitive measures from the United States government, including the United States subsidiary of Hikvision, a company owned by the Chinese government. The company, according to lobbying filings, paid a Mercury team including Mr. Lanza a fee that started at $70,000 a month to lobby on the carrying out of a military-spending bill. The bill bars the United States government from purchasing video surveillance products made by a handful of Chinese companies, including Hikvision, ZTE and Huawei, whose chief financial officer was arrested in Canada at the request of the United States government, apparently on suspicion of violating sanctions against Iran. Sanctions targets who had not previously tried to win reprieve are sensing an opening. Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine, who had sanctions levied against him in 2014, has discussed a push to win relief and refurbish his image with well-connected law and lobbying firms including Greenberg Traurig. Among the other Trump-linked lobbyists who have received big contracts from targets of sanctions and tariffs is Brian Ballard, a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee. His firm signed a $125,000-a-month contract in August 2017 to represent the Turkish-state-owned bank Halkbank, which has been working to avoid punishment for its role in a billion-dollar scheme to evade sanctions on Iran. The representation brought Mr. Ballard into discussions with Mr. Giuliani, who represented a gold trader charged in the scheme. Then there is the lawyer Alan Dershowitz. His criticism of the special counsel's investigation of Mr. Trump has endeared him to the president. But Mr. Dershowitz also has a long history of representing clients in transnational legal matters, including sanctions. Mr. Dershowitz is advising Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire who was the target of sanctions by Washington last year for using his connections to Mr. Kabila, the Congolese president, to facilitate what the Treasury Department called ""opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals."" Mr. Dershowitz called Mr. Gertler ""a very good person"" who is ""being targeted primarily because of the actions of other people."" While Mr. Trump has invited Mr. Dershowitz to the White House to discuss Middle East issues on multiple occasions, Mr. Dershowitz said he had not used his access to lobby on behalf of Mr. Gertler. ""I would never raise an issue like this,"" he said. Mr. Kabila's government has stocked up on consultants who have cast themselves as able to broker access at the highest levels of the administration. It has paid $8 million to its security contractor, an Israeli firm called Mer Security and Communication Systems, to hire American lobbyists, according to lobbying filings. Mer paid $500,000 in April 2017 to Alston & Bird, the firm of former Senator Bob Dole. Mr. Dole's team indicated that it could secure a meeting between Mr. Kabila and Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the relationship. The meeting never happened, and Mer ended the subcontract in frustration. Mer proceeded to invest millions more in lobbying and public relations firms with lower profiles but closer ties to the Trump team. Lobbying filings show $360,000 paid by Mer to Adnan Jalil, a former congressional liaison for Mr. Trump's campaign; $250,000 to the firm of Nancye Miller, the wife of the Trump campaign adviser and former C.I.A. chief R. James Woolsey Jr.; $680,000 to the firm of former Representative Robert L. Livingston, an early Trump endorser; and $598,000 to the firm of Brian Glicklich, who has represented Trump allies such as Breitbart News and Rush Limbaugh. Mer also agreed to pay $1.25 million to the firm of Robert Stryk, who had worked with Trump campaign officials, to organize the Hay-Adams event and meetings around it for Mr. Kabila's special envoy to the United States. (Mr. Stryk's firm, Sonoran Policy Group, also signed a $100,000-a-month contract in August to represent Somalia in its bid for increased military aid from the Trump administration and removal from its travel ban list. And Sonoran registered as a subcontractor for a law firm to lobby for a notorious Serbian arms dealer who was hit with sanctions for selling weapons to Liberia). At the time of the Congolese reception, the Trump administration and the international community were pressuring Mr. Kabila to step down, partly by intimating that his allies might face additional sanctions. Not only had he been accused of violent repression of dissent and looting millions, but he had overstayed the country's constitutionally mandated term limits by nearly two years. The Congolese officials at the reception posed for photos with Mr. Giuliani, and afterward there was some confusion about his connection to the lobbying effort. Francois Balumuene, the Congolese ambassador to the United States, suggested in an interview in September that his country was working with Mr. Giuliani to figure out the administration's position on an upcoming presidential election called by Mr. Kabila to avoid threatened sanctions. ""What I know is that it is possible that Giuliani will let us know how to go ahead,"" Mr. Balumuene said. He referred additional questions about Mr. Giuliani's role to the country's special envoy to Washington, Raymond Tshibanda, who could not be reached for comment. Mr. Giuliani said he was not serving as an intermediary between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the administration. In an interview in September, he initially said he stopped by the reception for a half-hour to ""say hello to people"" and to impress a woman with whom he had been dining by taking her ""to the top of the Hay-Adams to see a Washington party"" with a ""great view."" But he later suggested that he attended at least partly because he was interested in exploring business opportunities, adding, ""We've always wanted to see what's Africa all about."" And someone familiar with Mr. Giuliani's business affairs said that one of his companies has recently been negotiating a consulting deal to work in the Democratic Republic of Congo, possibly through Mer. In text messages on Sunday, Mr. Giuliani said that ""if I do it, it would only be security consulting"" similar to what he does in other countries, not lobbying. ""Beyond that, I can't say anything other than you can assume if we are working in a foreign country, we are doing security — physical and cyber, antiterrorism, emergency management."" It is not clear whether the lobbying overseen by Mer had much effect, and several of Mer's subcontracts with Trump-linked lobbyists have expired. Less than a month after the Hay-Adams event, Mr. Kabila announced that he would not seek a third term in presidential elections scheduled for this month. While some Trump administration officials are concerned that the elections are being tilted in favor of Mr. Kabila's chosen successor, the United States has not leveled additional sanctions against the country since Mr. Kabila's announcement — an outcome some lobbyists on the account are privately claiming as a victory. In October, Mer signed a new $200,000 contract with a public relations firm called Sanitas International that was co-founded by Christopher Harvin, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign who had worked in President George W. Bush's administration. The firm is seeking to demonstrate to the news media that Mr. Kabila does, in fact, intend to step down and hold free and fair elections."
News,2018-12-11,This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/magazine/war-yemen-american-bomb-strike.html,7607," This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center Just before midnight, a businessman named Rabee'a was on the phone, trying to calm his friend down. Rabee'a owned a drill rig, and his friend had heard stories from elsewhere in Yemen about jets bombing well sites. It was Sept. 10, 2016, a year and a half into the war between the Saudis and the Houthi rebels. But to Rabee'a, it was a war happening over the horizon, out of sight. He was unbothered. That kind of thing wouldn't happen in a poor place like this one, a district called Arhab that, though deep in rebel territory, was home to nothing and no one of interest to a fighter jet. Besides, things like airstrikes didn't happen to people like him. Rabee'a was a charitable man from a privileged family — a little self-satisfied, perhaps, but he had enjoyed good fortune for much of his life, and that wasn't about to change. Despite a mischievous grin, he was a godly man, a good man, and finding water in poor places for poor people had become his calling; he even forgave debts when his customers couldn't pay. His big heart, he was certain, had locked in his good luck. ""I'm doing a good, legitimate business!"" he said. ""Those jets have no quarrel with a man on the road to God!"" He hung up. It was a peaceful night. There was electricity in the air. Behind him, people were celebrating, and they were celebrating him, really. Arhab had been running low on water. Villagers didn't have enough to drink or to irrigate new fields. They needed a well, but no government entity was capable of undertaking such a public-works project; no bank was available to extend a line of credit. None of the villagers in the district, most of whom farmed plots five or 10 meters square, had anywhere near the kind of capital it would take to finance the dig. So people from villages around the district found their own solution, working out a kind of shared-ownership arrangement. They all would benefit together if the drill struck water; each shareholder would get a few hours at the well every week. If the digging didn't succeed, though, they would all lose money they couldn't afford to lose. And there was no guarantee of success: The land was hard, and the best location for the well was high up on the black volcanic rock. Rabee'a arrived excited for the chance to be the one who found water in a hard place. He had started six weeks earlier. After 12 days, the machine broke. Rabee'a and his workers managed to fix the drill and get it through 400 meters before layers of earth began collapsing, pinning the drill in place. For a day, he made no progress. Then two more days, then a week, as the villagers' tab continued to run. After two weeks, with costs rising, Rabee'a got the drill free and guided it down through a few hundred more meters until water bubbled forth with the waste sand. News spread; people cheered. The gamble had paid off. Some villagers made their way up to the site, to bring Rabee'a food and to celebrate their new well. Eid was the next day, so it felt a little like a miracle. For Yousef, one of the drill workers, striking water meant he would go home for the holidays flush with cash. He went about his work, moving between the rig and a big tanker truck full of water to cool the drill. He took a break in the back of one of the trucks. Rabee'a's cousin arrived, a young judge whose name was Judge — Al-Qadi — a usually studious man who needed something to celebrate. He had worked at a court in Amran until the compound was bombed. He got a job in the capital, Sana, at the traffic court, but with the Saudis blockading the country, there wasn't as much fuel, which meant less driving and fewer cases. He didn't have anything else to do, so he decided to come to Arhab. Mahdi arrived, too, a pale old man chosen as a representative of the shareholders. Once he heard Rabee'a hit water, he set out for the well site, carrying all the villagers' money to pay the next installment. Fahd also showed up, the closest thing the villagers had to a lush. Just about every man in Yemen chews khat, a mild narcotic leaf, but they don't all chew it the way Fahd did. He chewed it both sides at a time, two big, puffed-out Louis Armstrong cheeks, whenever villagers gathered. Tonight he was even more energetic than usual, thanks to his acute sense of relief. Though he couldn't really afford to invest in the well project, he had felt compelled to buy a share; he felt that the village needed him. He spent a month visiting friends and relatives, charming and cajoling them into giving him loans; when he still didn't have enough, he asked his wife if he could sell her gold jewelry. Rabee'a's striking water had spared Fahd and his family from financial ruin. Fahd felt a little cold, though, so he walked away from the drill toward an old stone hut where some friends had gathered. At about that moment, thousands of feet above him, a pilot pushed a button that sent an electrical signal to a rack mounted underneath his plane. A series of pyrotechnic cartridges flashed, and a set of hooks holding a bomb in place popped open, while small pistons shoved the weapon away. Now, as Fahd walked into the hut, a weapon about the length of a compact car was wobbling gracelessly down through the air toward him, losing altitude and unspooling an arming wire that connected it to the jet until, once it had extended a few feet, the wire ran out and ripped from the bomb. Then it was as if the weapon woke up. A thermal battery was activated. Three fins on the rear extended all the way and locked in place. The bomb stabilized in the air. A guidance-control unit on the nose locked onto a laser reflection — invisible to the naked eye but meaningful to the bomb — sparkling on the rocks Fahd walked over. Fahd was in a buoyant mood as the weapon homed in on a point just a few meters from him, a few meters from the drill, from Rabee'a, from the judge whose name was Judge, from the drill worker lying down for a rest, from the old man arriving with the installment of cash the villagers owed. Above them, the warhead closed in at a few hundred knots. The war in Yemen has been going on for three years now. It began when the Houthis — a rebel group whose members mostly belong to the Zaydi sect of Shia Islam, a minority of a minority — took Yemen's capital in September 2014 and, with it, control over much of the country. Saudi Arabia, the Sunni superpower of the region, feared that this ascendant Shia movement to its south was a proxy of Iran, its chief rival. Concerned about encirclement by Shia forces, Saudi Arabia started bombing Yemen in March 2015, soon after the Houthis established a government. Almost immediately, the United Nations and human rights groups expressed alarm about the way the war was being prosecuted, with its startling toll on civilians and critical infrastructure. The Saudis' bombs have struck factories, roads, bridges, hospitals, wells, funerals, weddings, gatherings entirely of women and a school bus full of children. The United Nations reported last month that it has documented about 18,000 civilian deaths and injuries that have resulted from the fighting, almost 11,000 of them from airstrikes alone. Several other groups believe these estimates to be conservative. The Saudis have also blockaded Yemen, with the stated purpose of keeping weapons out of Houthi hands, but that has also made it extremely difficult to get food and humanitarian assistance into an already poor country. Together, the bombing campaign and blockade have spurred the worst continuing humanitarian crisis in the world. Eight million people are on the brink of famine; according to Save the Children, an international aid organization, 85,000 Yemenis under age 5 have already died of starvation. A cholera outbreak has spread to 21 of Yemen's 22 provinces. In carrying out the campaign in Yemen, the Saudis have been drawing on help from other Persian Gulf states, like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait, as well as nearby African countries, like Sudan and Egypt. But its most important source of material support is one faraway ally: America. In 2015, the United States began assigning Navy warships to the region to help prevent weapons shipments from reaching Yemen. As the Saudis began running sorties into Yemen, United States Central Command began flying American Stratotankers on refueling missions every day, until last month, allowing Saudi jets to loiter in the sky for longer in search of targets, rather than having to plan strikes in advance. Perhaps most crucial, America has sold the Saudis billions of dollars' worth of high-tech weapons to help them counter Iranian influence to their south. It wasn't so long ago that Iran was the prime beneficiary of the American arms trade. According to William Hartung, the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, Iran was a favored customer of Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, back when it was considered a stalwart of modernization and order in the Middle East. But after the revolution in 1979 that put the ayatollah in power, Saudi Arabia came to look like a model of stability in the region. And soon the Sunni kingdom became one of the most reliable patrons of the American defense industry. By the time of the Clinton administration, the United States was the world's biggest exporter of arms, with billions of dollars in weapons going to Saudi Arabia alone every year. Each successive president had new hopes for what propping up the Saudi military with weapons sales might accomplish. In 2007, President George W. Bush announced a $20 billion sale to the Saudis, in part to rebalance the region after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which had deposed a Sunni government and allowed a Shia one to replace it. Bush had inadvertently empowered Iran, and he thought selling weapons to Saudi Arabia could counteract that. In 2010, President Barack Obama announced a package of deals worth $60 billion to provide advanced fighter jets and other arms to the Saudis, citing both Iranian influence and American job creation. And then, in 2015, just as the Obama administration's signature foreign-policy goal — a nuclear deal with Iran — came within view, and just as gulf countries got anxious that the deal might signal that the United States was distancing itself from them, the Houthis moved on the Yemeni capital, and a new country fell under Iranian influence. Saudi Arabia needed more American bombs to drop, and within a month of the nuclear deal's adoption, the Defense Department announced an approved sale of $1.29 billion in mostly precision-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia. A year later, it was clear to the Obama administration that the Saudis were not using the guided weapons to minimize civilian casualties. So just before leaving office, Obama suspended the transfer of smart bombs to the Saudis. President Trump immediately reversed the suspension. On his first foreign trip as president — to Saudi Arabia — he announced that he would resume and expand the sale of weapons. There was an effort in Congress to stop the process. Senator Rand Paul — a Kentucky Republican, who co-sponsored a bill to halt the sale of weapons to the Saudis with Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat — took to the Senate floor with a picture of a starving Yemeni child. ""It is astounding what is going on there,"" Paul said, ""and it is being done without your permission, but with your weapons."" The resolution was defeated 53 to 47, mostly along party lines, a vast majority of Republicans siding against Paul and with the president. Congress is again debating American involvement in the war in Yemen, but regardless of what happens in the future, the United States has already provided formidable capacity to the Saudi-led aerial campaign. From just 2010 to last year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's Arms Transfer Database, the United States delivered to Saudi Arabia 30 F-15 multirole jet fighters in the F-15SA-configuration — the most advanced iteration the United States produces — as well as 84 combat helicopters, 110 air-to-surface cruise missiles and nearly 20,000 guided bombs. This last category includes 11,320 Paveways: a type of laser-guided bomb that can be dropped from nine miles away and 40,000 feet up and that will, more often than not, strike within 10 feet of its target. At the well site, at the moment of impact, a series of events happened almost instantaneously. The nose of the weapon hit rock, tripping a fuse in its tail section that detonated the equivalent of 200 pounds of TNT. When a bomb like this explodes, the shell fractures into several thousand pieces, becoming a jigsaw puzzle of steel shards flying through the air at up to eight times the speed of sound. Steel moving that fast doesn't just kill people; it rearranges them. It removes appendages from torsos; it disassembles bodies and redistributes their parts. A sphere of expanding gas coming off the bomb, meanwhile, fills a body's hollow parts with energy, rupturing eardrums, collapsing lungs, perforating abdominal cavities and making hidden things bleed. The blast wave pushes air to such extraordinary speeds that the wind alone can cast limbs off bodies. The back of the tanker truck launched off its chassis and slammed into rock. Jagged pieces of bomb flew thousands of miles per hour outward, and Rabee'a — still celebrating his success — was almost fully decapitated. The top half of his face was removed, leaving just an open lower jaw; the heat of the blast burned most of his clothes off and charred his skin, so he was left naked, his genitals exposed, his body actually smoking. Next to him, his cousin Al-Qadi, the judge, was burning alive, his blood vessels expelling water and his body inflating. He began to scream. Fahd had just stepped into the stone shelter and registered only a sudden brightness. He heard nothing. He was picked up, pierced with shrapnel, spun around and then slammed into the back wall, both of his arms shattering — the explosion so forceful that it excised seconds from his memory. Metal had bit into leg, trunk, jaw, eye; one piece entered his back and exited his chest, leaving a hole that air and liquid began to fill, collapsing his lungs. By the time he woke up, crumpled against stone, he was suffocating. Somehow he had survived, but he was killing himself with every breath, and he was bleeding badly. But he wasn't even aware of any of these things, because his brain had been taken over by pain that seemed to come from another world. He couldn't think of anything except that he had to get out of the hut. As the dust began to clear, he saw that the ground was littered with burning chunks of metal. The hut had been turned into an oven, and he was trapped inside it. He felt as if he were in hell, as if it were Judgment Day. He had to get away, but when he tried to crawl over the burning metal, he fell down to his side because his forearms were pulverized. He began to roll, like a child going down a hill. He rolled over superheated metal, over the body parts of his friends. He wasn't thinking about his friends. He wasn't thinking about anyone. He wasn't even thinking about his family. In that moment, Fahd forgot he had children. Yousef woke up on top of the drilling truck's cab, with the vague sense that he had been carried there by a wave of fire. He looked down and saw that his left leg had been ribboned into strings of blood and bone. He realized he was shaking. He groped around the debris littering the truck cab, trying to find something to tie off his leg; he knew, maybe from movies, maybe from friends, he didn't know exactly how, that this is what you were supposed to do when a limb was ripped off. He saw a burst of bright flashes in the air — tracer rounds, a tribal S.O.S. — and knew someone was calling for help. When Dr. Abdullatif Abotaleb, the director of Al Thawra Modern General Hospital in Sana, got a call about the airstrike in Arhab, he was at home in the capital, an hour and a half away. A small man with a tired, raspy voice that flips up an octave when he is exasperated, Abotaleb is a dynamo of energy — and he has to be, now that he has become perhaps the city's busiest trauma surgeon in addition to running the entire 850-bed facility. On a day without airstrikes, just to make it from one side of his office to another, he has to push through the orbit of people shoving papers in his face; the hospital, with its singular appetite for signatures, often seems purposefully designed to maximize the amount of paper changing hands. It sometimes seems to Abotaleb as if every single employee there needs his personal attention. When bombs fall, though, he escapes the paperwork. He goes down to the operating room and works nonstop, one patient after another, sometimes not emerging from surgery for 24 hours. And he has seen, in those hours standing over the operating table after airstrikes, grim things. He has seen his own son. Just 20 years old, he was brought to the hospital blackened almost beyond recognition, after the car he was in was hit by an airstrike. Abotaleb found some grace in the severity of the burns — as he operated, he was able to imagine that the young man wasn't his son. The illusion fell apart when he saw a scar he recognized on the patient's big toe. Abotaleb couldn't save him. He operated on his own brother, hit in a different strike, one that killed his other brother and his father, too. So now Abotaleb tries to banish feeling when he's at work. He thinks of it as making his heart like stone. And when he's done, he goes home and cries with his surviving children. That morning in September 2016, when he arrived at the emergency department, he found the corridors lined with dying patients and desperate family members from a different airstrike, one that happened closer by in Sana. People yelled for him as he walked by, trying to hold his attention. Abotaleb tries to resist these appeals. He tries instead to focus on the patients he has a chance of saving. He does not count on miracles; even miracles require equipment, and because of the blockade, he was running low on pretty much every critical resource and diagnostic tool that a normal hospital needs to function, let alone one that sees regular mass-casualty events from bombs designed to dismember people hundreds of yards in every direction. They were nearly out of general anesthesia. Lately, they had been relying on halothane, a cheap anesthetic suspected of causing liver damage, no longer used in North America. They weren't able to get enough gloves or masks. They barely had any blood, because they couldn't get the bags that hold donated blood past the blockade. They were even low on bedsheets, which they could change only once a week. And they couldn't get the correct parts to properly fix the washing machine, so it broke nearly every day. Everything was dirty. The hospital was a septicemia factory; Abotaleb often worried that he was desperately trying to save patients just so they might survive long enough to die of an infection caught at his hospital. But since the blockade began, Abotaleb had taught himself tricks. He used IV lines to join severed arteries; he used IV lines as feeding tubes. He is up against bombs so proficient at traumatic amputations that his burn patients often don't have other limbs to graft from, so he has learned to be creative when finding places on of the body to harvest skin. And he has learned not to try to help patients he doesn't think he can save. That morning, he saw a boy he should have walked past but didn't. Three years old, maybe younger, certainly no older. The boy's legs were gone; part of an arm was, too. As Abotaleb worked in vain on the boy in the operating room, victims from Arhab began arriving outside, piled together in the back of a pickup truck. Al-Qadi was almost unrecognizable from the swelling. A slight man, he now looked obese. Yousef the drill worker looked possessed, his eyes vacant and, somehow, at the same time wrathful. Fahd was suffocating and bleeding out, five minutes from death, maybe less. Abotaleb knew immediately that Fahd needed equipment he didn't have, but Abotaleb chose him anyway. The bleeding and the fractures and the shrapnel were not Fahd's only — or even most pressing — issues. One side of his chest was totally compressed, and he was almost unable to breathe. Abotaleb needed an underwater seal drainage system, a piece of equipment that creates closed suction, which allows air and fluid to escape the pleural cavity but none to come back in, relieving pressure on the chest and allowing the patient to breathe. The hospital didn't have one of those. So Abotaleb improvised. He asked someone to bring him a plastic water bottle. He cut a hole in one end and put an IV line into it. He cut into Fahd's chest and bound the other end of the IV line into the space between his rib cage and his lungs. Fahd was in agony as Abotaleb cut into him. He also felt intense thirst; he had lost so much blood that he was in shock. To Fahd, it seemed as if the people hovering over him were there to continue his torture. He had an animal instinct to strike back. He couldn't use his arms but wished Abotaleb would get close enough for him to bite. Still, the doctor continued to work. With one end of the IV line inserted into Fahd's chest and the other end attached to a hole in the plastic water bottle a few centimeters below the water line, the contraption created a one-way valve that let air and fluid out of Fahd's chest while preventing any from going the other way. With the lines in place, Fahd's chest began to empty. Fahd's lung finally began to inflate. Next, Abotaleb tried to stabilize Al-Qadi; he and his nurses bound as much of his skin as they could with the little gauze they could expend on him, but the director knew they needed to get him out of there. With his skin flaking off, Al-Qadi was losing his barrier to the outside world, and this hospital was the worst place for someone susceptible to infection. They sent him to another hospital, where he survived for two more days. Abotaleb went to the next patient, who seemed to be bleeding internally, but it was unclear where, and he didn't have access to imaging tools, so he did what he often did: He cut the patient open and looked around. He found the worst of it was the patient's liver, so he began trying to stitch it with the wrong kind of needle, because the hospital didn't have liver needles. He made the liver bleed more. He waited a few minutes for it to subside before trying to stitch again. But before he could finish, he got a call: Something else had happened at the well in Arhab. More patients were coming. When the Saudis buy weapons, they prefer to use the Foreign Military Sales program (F.M.S.), meaning that the United States Department of Defense serves as their broker. For a 2 percent administrative fee tacked on to the purchase price, the Pentagon handles the logistics and liaises with the private companies to fulfill the order. F.M.S., the mission of which is to ""strengthen the security of the U.S. and promote world peace,"" is actually overseen by the State Department, which reviews all requests. More than 100 countries around the world bought weapons from the United States this way in the 2017 fiscal year. Certain countries can buy certain weapons systems directly from manufacturers, but the Saudis like the politics of buying from the United States government and feel they get more expeditious treatment from American companies when the Pentagon speaks on their behalf. Normally, after a sale through F.M.S., the military's transportation command takes possession of the weapons and delivers them to the foreign customer. But Saudi Arabia instead hires private charter flights — giant Soviet-era Ilyushin cargo planes, filled with guided-bomb components — and flies them all the way to Saudi Air Force bases. There, the tail fins and the laser-guidance kits are attached to either end of the warheads, and free-fall gravity bombs are transformed into laser-guided weapons, which are then loaded up onto the bomb racks beneath jet fighters. It's a process that happens at the Saudi's base in Dhahran on the Persian Gulf and at King Khalid Air Base in Saudi Arabia's southwestern corner. King Khalid is the country's southernmost base and has a squadron of F-15s strategically stationed there. It happened to be just 200 miles from a new well about to come online in a district called Arhab. An F-15 at top speed can close that distance in about six minutes. That morning, villagers all around Arhab were making their way to the bomb site. Some came to try to help; some came searching for missing loved ones. Many of them, especially the children, came out of curiosity, running out of the house before parents could grab them, trying to find out what that rumble was that woke them in the middle of the night. A little after daybreak, more than a hundred people had gathered. There is some disagreement about what happened next. Some say they heard multiple planes. Some heard others scream. Some swear that there was no warning, that they didn't hear or see anything beforehand. What's not in dispute is that the second wave of bombing began about six hours after the first explosion, once a sizable crowd had formed. There was a sudden, massive upwelling of air and debris, and everybody started to run. People went in all different directions as the planes roared overhead and things started to explode. Cars and motorcycles went hurtling through the air. Boys were cut down as they tried to escape; grown men dove into nearby cornfields. The attack lasted for hours. It felt as if another bomb fell every few minutes — each of them seeming to strike people trying to escape, as if following them. The people said it did not feel like an attack. The word they used translates to ""extermination."" Human Rights Watch reported that at least 31 civilians were killed, three of them children, and that 42 more were injured. It's hard to know the numbers for sure, because all that was left of many victims were very small parts, very far from one another. People dragged sheets around the bomb site, trying to collect parts they thought might belong to loved ones. Cellphones didn't always survive explosions, but inside them, memory cards sometimes did, and sometimes those memory cards had photos that helped villagers identify the missing. At least 11 bodies were so charred or mutilated that they could not be identified. And most of the villagers were so traumatized, so terrified, that they didn't want to go outside at all. Islam compels its adherents to bury the deceased within 24 hours, so the villagers of Arhab had to hold funerals, but they were too afraid to gather outside. No one knew when planes might appear out of nowhere again. In homes all across Arhab, minor dramas played out as surviving family members argued with one another about who got to go say goodbye and who had to stay home. The funerals were poorly attended. All across the country, people were learning a version of the same lesson. They stayed home from factory jobs, because even if their factory hadn't been hit, maybe it would be next. On the roads, people kept extra car lengths when driving behind cargo trucks. Anything of value — anything bringing commerce or food or health — could, at any moment, explode and disassemble your friends. It's hard to say what the aggregate effect of living in constant terror of airstrikes has been. A local human rights worker pointed out one thing, though: She noticed that Yemenis had stopped digging wells. And maybe this is part of the reason the number of people in critical need of clean water rose. With sanitation facilities and wells like the one in Arhab coming under attack, cholera was, perhaps, inevitable. The first cases were reported three weeks after the strike in Arhab (and a few dozen miles away). Seven months later, the country had more than 100,000 suspected cases. Arhab had one of the highest attack rates in the country, and after a year, there were nearly one million suspected cases of cholera in the country, making it not only the worst outbreak in the world but also one of the worst in recorded history. In the fall of 2016, a researcher for Human Rights Watch named Priyanka Motaparthy was planning a trip to Yemen with her colleagues as part of their mission of documenting attacks on civilians and critical infrastructure. When she learned of what sounded like an attack on both in a remote district called Arhab, she knew it should be on the list. By the time she and the team got into the country, and then made their way up to Arhab, two months had passed since the attack. Motaparthy was immediately struck by just how many weapons had been used. There were craters everywhere; she counted at least 12, though villagers believe that as many as 20 bombs fell that day. Motaparthy found an extraordinary number of bomb remnants. She was surprised, at first, that nobody had bothered to pick them up yet. But the strike in Arhab had not become the focus of international attention, and the Houthis were more interested in publicizing other strikes. Villagers later told me that many people were simply afraid of bomb parts, believing, based on what happened to the victims, that the weapons must have contained some strange poison. Whatever the reason, the bomb fragments just sat there. Among all the other bits and shards lying around, Motaparthy found a data plate from a wing section that, though curled and partly damaged, had mostly survived the strike. This fragment was a key to a whole history of the weapon's journey. Because of Motaparthy's research, we have been able to find out a wealth of information about the bomb's provenance. The data plate had a Department of Defense Identification Code that indicated it was part of a fin on a guided bomb. It also had a manufacture date, showing that it had rolled off an assembly line in October 2015. It had a stock number that, when combined with an assembly number, revealed that the data plate belonged to part of the control mechanism for something called a Paveway II laser-guidance system. This sort of kit is designed to attach to a 500-pound MK82 warhead, a bomb manufactured in Garland, Tex., at a General Dynamics facility. There, about 300 pounds of blank steel is heated up and then forged into hollow shells. Those shells then travel 150 miles north to an Army munitions plant in McAlester, Okla., a 45,000-acre compound where the shells are hung, nose down. Next, they're filled with 200 pounds of warm explosive, sometimes Tritonal but more often something called Composition H6, a compound whose main ingredient is RDX, the explosive used in bombs the Allies dropped on the Germans. The explosives cool and harden, base plates are attached and the steel shells become bombs, ordnance you can drop out of the sky and, if you drop enough of them, have some modest confidence that you'll hit your target. Or you can attach them to a guidance system made by one of the private companies that build modification kits for dumb bombs. The scrap Motaparthy found had an assembly code unique to one American manufacturer: Raytheon, which makes Paveway II guidance kits at its facility in Tucson, Arizona. In early October this year, news began to leak out about the disappearance of a prominent Saudi dissident. Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who often criticized the Saudi regime in The Washington Post, had visited the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to collect paperwork and never emerged. Once inside, he had been brutally murdered and dismembered by a team of Saudi hit men. American intelligence implicated the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in ordering the assassination, and in the weeks since the news broke, as increasingly gruesome details trickled out, this one death has done what thousands in Yemen could not: draw America's attention to the strange, cozy relationship between the United States and the Saudi monarchy. On Nov. 28, the Senate voted on a resolution to open debate about ending the American role in Yemen wholesale, and this time, it passed. But the White House has threatened to veto any bill that would unwind American involvement in the conflict and continues to vociferously defend its relationship with Saudi Arabia. Earlier in November, President Trump put out an official statement defending, in mercenary terms, his continued support of the Saudis. ""After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States,"" the statement said. ""Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors."" (The State Department has acknowledged that only a $14.5 billion deal had been made at present.) Because American jobs are the Trump administration's stated reason for selling the weapons, I went to Tucson to see what those jobs were like. The city is surrounded by dry, scrubby land. Not much grows there. Brown mountains rise in jagged peaks; the topography is almost identical to northern Yemen. Tucson even has F-16s from an Air National Guard base soaring around the valley — single-engine jets that are smaller and slower than the F-15s the Saudis fly. When you hear the air curdling, you don't know at first if it's wind or an 18-wheeler pushing down Interstate 10, and then there's a roar, and backswept wings appear and disappear above you. Tucson also has a wealth of defense contractors, all part of the Sun Corridor, a booster group that puts up signs proclaiming the region's laurels; that Tucson, for example, was named one of ""America's best cities for global trade"" by Global Trade Magazine. Of all the companies in the Sun Corridor, though, the biggest private employer, by a sizable margin, is Raytheon Missile Systems, a subsidiary of Raytheon. Raytheon began its corporate life as the American Appliance Company, developing refrigerators and radio parts, but it was drawn into military contracting during World War II. By the 1990s, the industry was contracting with the end of the Cold War, but Raytheon remained committed to defense. It even began selling off nonmilitary businesses and buying up military-oriented subsidiaries of other companies, including those at Texas Instruments and Chrysler. One of the more tectonic shifts in the industry, however, occurred when Raytheon outbid Northrop Grumman to buy Hughes Electronics. Howard Hughes, the aircraft pioneer and industrial magnate, had not wanted to build missiles at his aircraft plant in Los Angeles — it was too close to the coast, and therefore, he feared, susceptible to attack — so he went looking for someplace inland, eventually settling on Tucson. When Raytheon acquired Hughes Electronics in 1997, it also acquired the missile plant. The acquisition nearly doubled its annual sales, and today Raytheon employs nearly 10,000 people in Tucson alone. Raytheon makes more money on defense than any company in the world except Lockheed Martin, with nearly $25 billion in sales a year. At a local union hall in Tucson, I met two funny, gentle, welcoming men, and we spoke for an evening about their lives at Raytheon. (I have elected not to identify them.) One of them, a quiet man with an easy, endearing laugh, worked in assembly, where all the pieces come together before a weapon goes out the door. His story of going to work at Raytheon sounded to me like the Platonic ideal of the American working family in the postwar industrial boom. His father had a good job at the plant, and he wanted to be just like his dad. He started out as a custodian, working his way up to his current position. The other man, who had been a machinist for years, was proud of his work, too. He described at first a line of reasoning that politicians use too: that better precision-guided weapons help countries avoid hurting anyone they're not trying to. For him, though, the thing that he said made him most proud about working at Raytheon was helping to keep American servicemen and women safe. The company makes a point of hiring veterans with combat injuries, which reminds him of whom he's working for and why. He feels it when he sees the gigantic photos of service members that the company hangs in the most prominent parts of the plant. The photos, he explained, are of relatives of Raytheon workers. When he's at work, the notion of helping American servicemen and women is not abstract. It's almost tactile. The company's impact is considerably more abstract from the C-suite. On the most recent earnings call, an analyst asked Raytheon executives about the Saudi arms sales. His concern was whether ""issues in the Middle East at the moment and specifically Saudi Arabia"" could have ""any negative ramifications for your business."" The answer was, in essence, Don't worry. The company's chief executive, Thomas Kennedy, reminded analysts that Raytheon has customers in over 80 countries. Raytheon's chief financial officer, Anthony O'Brien, then chimed in to add that the Saudis accounted for just 5 percent of the company's revenue. About a year after the strike, the Joint Incident Assessment Team, a body composed of coalition members that analyzes the legality of its own airstrikes, released a statement saying that the pilots had bombed the well site in Arhab because they thought it was a ballistic-missile launcher. It's an excuse that strains credulity; ballistic-missile launchers do not look very much like drilling rigs. On the other hand, Saudi pilots are known to prefer flying as high as they can for fear of ground fire, and that makes them more likely to misidentify what they're bombing. And thanks to American aerial refueling, the Saudi jets could engage in ""dynamic targeting,"" meaning they go out and look for things to bomb. It had been two years and a month since the strike by the time I made my way to Yemen, and then up to Arhab in rebel territory, after months of negotiations; I had to get permission from the Saudi-backed government in the south and from the Houthis in the north. I needed to fly into Saudi-controlled Aden and make my way by road to rebel territory. I was made to dress in traditional Yemeni clothes and chew khat in order to sneak through the checkpoints, though I'm not sure whether this was necessary for my own safety or for the amusement of my fixers. I arrived in the north to find other journalists who had simply gotten in cars in their safari shirts. I had expected the scene of the attack to be sterilized by the time I arrived. But the bomb site still looked like a bomb site: bits of headlight housings, things that looked like spark plugs, curled pieces of rubber that I assumed had once been tires. There were craters a few feet from the well, then a few meters away another one, some a hundred meters away or more. People had run far. The tank from the water truck still lay smashed against a bank of rocks; it looked like a giant soda can shot through buckshot and then crushed by a giant hand. The chassis was still there too, twisted up on the rock. Both of them were too heavy, or too pointless, to move. Villagers kicked around the rocks, nudged pebbles aside with their shoes and handed little things to me that felt much heavier than they looked. These, they said, were from the bombs. My first morning in Arhab I spent in a classroom with 30 or maybe 50 people, maybe 60. Many had obvious and horrifying injuries, while others were brandishing ID cards to show me. I didn't at first understand, and then my translator started saying, ""That's his brother""; ""That's his son."" They had come anticipating that they would need proof. That the American might not believe they lost who they said they lost. I had never been in a room with so many grown men in tears. I met Yousef, the drill worker, in that classroom. He looked sad, but I thought he was wrongly translated when he told me that he had lost a leg. He must have seen my confusion, because he hiked the fabric of his skirt up and showed the basic plastic prosthesis clipped to a stump, above where his knee would have been. I met Fahd in that classroom, too. And after that, I spent a lot of time with him, mostly on the floor of a room in a village elder's house. By then he had spent most of a year in the hospital, managing to evade deadly infection, then most of a year out of it, but he had changed. His arms were curled and contracted. He couldn't lift much of anything, so he was mostly useless in the fields. He couldn't provide for his family, and he had lost his entire investment that day at the well. But what frustrated him most was the shrapnel the doctors couldn't remove from his head. He told me it changes the way his mind works; he's angry all the time, and he thinks there's a chemical reason for that, something in the metal. Sometimes, he said, it hurts so badly that he has an urge to remove it and has to stop himself from grabbing a knife and cutting into his face. As Fahd was explaining this, the room grew quiet. He stopped midconversation, and someone pointed up at the ceiling as if having a thought. ""F-15s."" They told me to go outside so I could hear better, to look up. I did, and I couldn't see anything, but I could hear, just barely. I wouldn't have identified it as a fighter jet. I'm not even sure I would have identified it as a plane. It sounded like a very concentrated wind, miles away. I asked how they knew it wasn't a commercial flight, and they reminded me of the blockade: There are no commercial flights here. And anyway, the sound is different. Even children there knew the sound F-15s make. They had learned to tell the difference between the sonic signatures of the aircraft that fly overhead, making up names, onomatopoeia for the noises they make, like zanana and waziza, for the buzzing drones. The next day, I would learn of an airstrike in the neighboring district. Back inside, we resumed our conversation, but again, Fahd stopped talking for a moment, and this time, he began moving across the carpet toward me. He hoisted himself over his bad leg and leaned forward. His eyes were suddenly bright, and I saw what other villagers had described when they spoke of Fahd before the strike, this once-energetic man, once so intense and charismatic. He tilted his head toward me, and then I understood he wanted me to touch his face. I turned my wrist to use the back of my hand, as if checking a child for a temperature; somehow that seemed less intrusive. Fahd moved his head closer, and then my hand was against his face, and I could feel hard bits of metal rolling around beneath the cartilage of his jaw. He guided my hand up to his temple, where some misshapen thing slid around beneath the skin, as if trying to escape my fingers. He pulled his eyelid down to show where the steel still was. And it struck me that this was a surreal way to encounter American ordnance, at the end of journey that began in the American Southwest and brought it all the way here, in this remote part of a desperately poor country, to the face of a man who, for just a moment two years and one month ago, thought he had something to celebrate."

Tulips, a newly fashionable luxury item, temporarily became more valuable than houses — until, obviously, the inevitable market correction, which ruined fortunes and tore a nation apart. Except this is a myth: The historian Anne Goldgar, in her 2007 book on the topic, wrote that while tulip prices certainly got a bit silly in the 1630s, she could find no evidence of anyone going bankrupt over them. The tulip was simply a luxury commodity that underwent a brief upward swing in value. The more entertaining version was brought to us by the anti-tulip propaganda of the age: pamphlets spreading exaggerated tales about these wilting, decadent symbols of wealth and the ruin they brought with them. And yet the story of the tulips is still lodged in the modern mind as the perfect case study of a ""bubble"" — more so, even, than the South Sea Bubble, one of several speculative crazes of the early 18th century, in which British investors were thrown into panic by the rise and fall of a preposterously overvalued trading company. To this day, people use tulips to express their incredulity over inflated values. Last December, the investor Dennis Gartman appeared on CNBC and called the rising value of Bitcoin a ""classic bubble"" that, compared with tulip mania, ""has gone even beyond that absurdity."" At a recent conference, the Italian economist Massimo Amato said the cryptocurrency was ""like a virtual tulip."" The persistence of such comparisons probably has something to do with how effectively tulip mania works as a fable, with a flattering moral at its core: If the people around you seem to be behaving irrationally, perhaps you're correct, and everyone else is deluded. Others are inside the ""bubble,"" incapable of spotting the distortions that are obvious to you. Of course houses are more valuable than flowers. Gartman and Amato, for instance, might have taken some grim satisfaction from what happened to Bitcoin in recent weeks: As of late November, it was trading at just over $3,700, down from a peak that neared $20,000, and the N.Y.U. economist Nouriel Roubini was tweeting about feeling ""vindicated"" that ""this cryptobubble went bust for good."" The trouble is that financial bubbles turn out to be far harder to recognize than you might think. Economists have spent decades debating precisely what they are, and how an observer might spot one in the wild, without arriving at a clear consensus. The Nobel Prize-winning Robert J. Shiller, in his 2000 book ""Irrational Exuberance,"" considers them simple enough, but the equally Nobel Prize-winning Eugene Fama is skeptical of the very concept of a bubble, partly because he believes that it's impossible to predict, mathematically speaking, whether you're in one. Even after what looks like a catastrophic crash, value can rebound — as has happened in the past, many of the times Bitcoin has been declared doomed. The temptation to spot bubbles is widespread; the ability to actually identify them, less so. You could potentially blame a completely different kind of ""bubble"" for the once-soaring value of Bitcoin: the ideological enclave of cryptocurrency evangelists. In Forbes, Jason Bloomberg wrote that ""most of the noise around both blockchain and crypto is little more than the community talking to itself — a massive 'echo chamber.' "" We like to imagine ourselves as cannily seeing through such echo chambers — the self-reinforcing intellectual snow globes of people who get all their information from one another, who imagine that all the world works like their particular corner of it. But we seem to have less faith in everyone else's ability to do the same. Witness recent accusations that liberals live in a ""coastal bubble,"" full of coddled elites who understand more about avocados than about the crises of Rust Belt towns. Or the counteraccusation: that rural Americans have alarmingly little real exposure to people or lifestyles even slightly different from their own. In a September article at Washington Monthly, Nancy LeTourneau warned of an ""information bubble"" that was, according to one poll, leading 57 percent of strong Trump supporters to doubt that Democrats had a chance of capturing the House in midterm elections — calling back to the libertarian writer Julian Sanchez's blogged 2010 warning that the conservative movement was ""moving toward epistemic closure,"" though not the liberal activist Eli Pariser's 2011 book arguing that online ""filter bubbles"" were presenting us all with information that flattered our existing biases. If you're trying to sort out why your ideological opponents seem, to you, so obviously foolish, here is one explanation that presents itself constantly. They are stuck in a ""bubble,"" unable to recognize any new information that doesn't match their convictions — about life, about America, about politics, about the value of notional currencies, about the relative values of tulips and houses, about anything. But this, too, may be less clear-cut than it feels. Pariser's notion of a ""filter bubble"" suggested that we were being divided by flaws in the infrastructure of the internet — things like personalization algorithms, which offer us precisely the information we're already inclined to want — meaning we might solve the problem with better engineering. More recent research, though, has suggested that this may not be where the problem lies; the statistician Seth Flaxman, writing with other researchers in Public Opinion Quarterly, has found that the influence of search algorithms on individual browsing bias may not be as strong as it seemed. And while it's often taken as a given that social media is politically polarizing, there's evidence to suggest that the demographic groups that have polarized recently are the ones least likely to use social media. It's obvious that Americans live in social bubbles — living and talking in circles divided by economics, race, ideology, geography, taste and so on. The problem arises as soon as you try to differentiate those that constitute real ""bubbles"" — which is to say, self-reinforcing spheres of blindness or irrationality — from those that might just as easily be called ""cultures"" or ""communities,"" groups of people who share experiences and convictions. Such groupings will certainly have drawbacks; our shared preconceptions often limit us. But to use the word ""bubble"" as a stand-alone pejorative is to focus on the ignorance inherent in a given worldview, rather than the insights; it's to examine ideological opponents and conclude that the only reason they could possibly believe what they do is because they haven't examined alternatives. It's nice to imagine that we can broaden someone's understanding of the world by illuminating their blind spots. The problem is that our helpful corrections are likely to be totally wrong. A well-meaning diagnosis of conservative bubbles like LeTourneau's — ""when everyone you know is a Republican,"" she writes, ""you can't imagine anyone who isn't"" — might run up against complicated research results: say, one that indicates conservatives are actually better at modeling liberal beliefs than the other way around. The difficulty of getting it right might explain the overwhelming vindication people clearly feel when someone else's ideological bubble really has been pricked. Less than two days after President Trump's electoral victory, The New York Post published a column by Michael Goodwin that was positively triumphant about it: ""The cluelessness in media and political circles about the Trump voter surge,"" he wrote, ""confirms that the ruling class is cosseted deeply in its bubbles and isolated from the concerns of other Americans."" So long as we're not among a bubble's inhabitants, its popping flatters our own delusion: that we're among the few right-thinking people who accurately measure value, who accurately perceive reality, who see far more clearly than the sheeplike, tulip-loving half-wits around us. What might be more helpful, when talk of a ""bubble"" crops up, is to think of yourself, rather than others — to be vigilant about the possibility that the most meaningful bubbles are the ones you're not aware of, rather than the ones you're eager to spot. They are, after all, incredibly pleasant and convincing when you're on the inside. The value they create is not an illusion: There is much to be gained from being in mental harmony with those around you, let alone owning something people are paying absurd prices for. It's dispiriting, perhaps, to think our various blinkers might not be easy to identify, but knowing this offers a sort of peace — the peace of spending less time wondering why everyone else is so hopelessly blinkered. If you're skeptical of your own ability to see everything clearly, you'll be less surprised when the actions of others refuse to blow up in their faces — or, perhaps, when you hear your own world emit an unexpected pop."
News,2018-12-11,"I recently ended a long relationship (we were engaged for several years). The split was tumultuous but ultimately amicable.

",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/magazine/do-i-have-to-repay-a-loan-to-an-ex-lover.html,1421," I recently ended a long relationship (we were engaged for several years). The split was tumultuous but ultimately amicable. While we were together, my fiancé gave me a loan to help with rent while I was on a low-paid work assignment as part of a graduate program. The sum was not small, but also not cripplingly large — about what you would pay for a used car, and he could afford it.  He asked me to sign a contract — a template he pulled offline. As part of this deal, he stipulated that if we ended up getting married, said contract would be null and void. However, if we broke up, I would be bound by this contract to repay him the money. I signed the contract. When we broke up, he insisted I repay the money. I feel strongly — and this view is backed up by friends and family — that this was money he invested in the relationship while we were together, and like many other financial hits both of us suffered by separating, he should forgive the debt, cut his losses and allow both of us to move on. He was in a much better financial position than I, and it would be easier for him to take the loss than it would be for me to repay him. He did not agree with my rationale, and since I was bound by this contract, and my own sense of pride and duty, I began making monthly payments, albeit small ones.  I've paid off about half this debt. I strongly believe that continuing to make payments to him keeps both of us from moving on with our personal lives. I can't imagine it's pleasant to receive a check with my name on it every month, and I don't enjoy seeing his name on my bank statements every month, either. Despite all the growth my ex claims to have done, he still believes I owe him the money. I know that it's likely I am legally obligated to repay the rest of this debt. However, I think it's unlikely that my ex will go to the trouble of taking legal action to pursue repayment. It's probably not worth the cost, time and hassle. Ethically and morally, is it O.K. for me to just stop making payments? While the monthly amount I send him does not impact my lifestyle hugely, it would still be nice to invest this money into my future goals, rather than sinking it into this past obligation. Given that I believe he should have just forgiven this debt, I feel like I should at least put up a bit of a fight and make it harder for him to collect these funds. Name Withheld As a rule, loans to lovers are a bad idea: they link people through affection and through the market at the same time, in ways that are hard to manage emotionally. If, as you say, giving you the money outright wouldn't have been a hardship on your ex-fiancé, the fact that he wanted a contract for repayment was a worrying sign. Still, you went along with it. Today, you (along with your friends and family) have decided that, legalities aside, you aren't morally obliged to fulfill the contract, because the money was not — as the contract presupposed — a loan but rather an ""investment"" in your relationship. That's a rather commercial metaphor, which could suggest that he was, in effect, buying your companionship. Neither morality nor popular music support the idea that money can buy you love. The original deal, though unwise, was morally O.K. If, at the time, you viewed the money as a nonreimbursable investment, you should have let him know, and refused to misrepresent the situation as a loan. Nor do the other reasons you provide — that it wouldn't be worthwhile for him to collect on the contract; that you would prefer to do something else with the money; that the money is less significant to him than it is to you; that the connection represented by a monthly check stops both of you from moving on with your lives — support your view that the contract is void. The moral meaning of an agreement cannot be decided by one party in retrospect. You think he's being a jerk about the money. And perhaps you're right to. The fallacy is concluding that if an assertion of a claim is blameworthy, it's no longer binding. In a play on the term ""supererogatory"" — which refers to acts that go above and beyond what duty requires — the philosopher Julia Driver coined the term ""suberogatory,"" for acts that are deplorable but not a breach of obligation. That's what you're describing. If you want to break the connection with your ex, take out a loan for what you still owe and pay him off now. This will give you two things that the current arrangement doesn't: escape from an emotionally freighted deal and a chance to build your credit. Not long ago, a couple of months before I completed my undergraduate degree, I confessed romantic feelings to a female friend, with whom I had been extremely close since freshman year. At one point, in a boneheaded move straight out of a romantic comedy, I attempted to kiss her. I didn't dwell on it because we continued to talk for another half-hour. She later came to my house, and after we talked for a while, said that she thought we should take some time apart. I was sure our friendship would recover. I asked her to grab a beer with me a few times over our remaining college months, but she said she was not yet ready. One day, seemingly out of the blue, she told me she could not see me anymore because she no longer felt comfortable around me. I didn't understand. We had been best friends for nearly four years; to me, this was merely a small speed bump. I begged for clarification, but my lack of understanding was upsetting to her. Ultimately, I asked her if what she really wanted was for me to delete her phone number and never contact her again. She said yes. Hurt, I did what she asked. When the #MeToo movement was in full swing, I thought about how this friend once told me, tearfully, about being sexually assaulted as a teenager by a guy she knew and trusted. And she now carried that assault with her everywhere she went. I suddenly understood. As much as I know I wasn't — and would never be — that guy, to her I was, or at least I could have been. I broke her trust and our bond by trying to kiss her when she did not want to be kissed.  I've felt awful about this for nearly a year. I want to email her and profusely apologize. How can she ever get close to a man without being afraid he'll want more than she does, and try to take it?  My ethical question is: Would I be breaking her trust again by contacting her after I promised not to? Would I be forcing her to relive something painful to make myself feel better? Or would she appreciate my apology, appreciate that the #MeToo movement made me reflect on my own behavior and its impact on those I care about. Does #MeToo allow me to take responsibility for my actions by apologizing directly, or would I be just another man making a woman's pain about himself? Name Withheld If someone reasonably asks you to do something and you agree, on what basis may you unilaterally withdraw your agreement? This was the question posed by the previous letter. In this case, your urge to try to make things right by apologizing is a decent one. But what matters is what would be good for her now. It's possible that she would value the knowledge that you understand why she felt wronged, especially if you kept your note short, and focused on apologizing rather than burdening her with your feelings. It's also possible that she has moved on and won't be pleased to be reminded of what happened. You can't be confident that your contacting her would bring her the substantial benefits that might justify overriding your agreement. You've learned your lesson. That's good. But she asked you not to contact her, and you aren't entitled to relieve your remaining sense of guilt at her expense."
News,2018-12-11,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — The phones start ringing early in the morning, with soft light seeping through straw curtains.

Some voices are rushed, others struggle for words to talk about what is hurting them: relationship troubles and war trauma, loneliness and financial stress. ""We have people who start their day with us — they get up in the morning, call us and then go to work,"" said Ranil Prasad Thilakaratne, manager of the CCC Line phone bank, a free counseling service in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo. ""They get the motivation, the encouragement, to face the day by calling us."" The hotline is thriving on the backs of a generous brigade of citizens brought together by a deeply rooted culture of volunteerism, stepping forward to help ease the load of Sri Lanka's vast mental health problems after a three-decade civil war that ended in 2009. [Read the story of how Sri Lanka is dealing with the lasting trauma of the war.] The service's 90 or so volunteers are filling the breach in a country that by some measures is successfully recovering from the war but that is still drastically underserved when it comes to treating mental illness, depression or even just everyday stresses. About a half-dozen volunteers at a time staff the hotline, in a small house down a nondescript alley. Sitting at their makeshift cubicles, they field about 90 calls a day. On a small table to the side are three folders with contacts for resources, from institutions dealing with sexual health, to rehab centers, to legal aid organizations. The hotline's phone number — 1333 — is toll free and well-advertised, through word of mouth and through partnerships. One of the important partners has been Shree FM, which has broadcast the No. 1 evening show in the country for the past 16 years. Called Firefly Night, the show is three hours of radio drama with the tagline ""unfortunately, true story."" Most of the listeners are from rural areas: carpenters, bus drivers, people without television. As if speaking to the mood of the nation, the subjects are dark: murder, rape, suicide. Its creators struggle to explain why people tune in to such dark stories. It appeals to what they call a widespread feeling of mussalai — the best translation for it being a sense of ""oppressively hurting."" ""People like it,"" said Chathura Wijerathna, the deputy director of the station. ""After a heavy day of work, they wash, they get themselves a little drink and then they sit close to the radio."" During breaks, the D.J. plays hit songs, but also shares the number to the suicide hotline. Lakmini, who retired after 29 years as a banker, has volunteered at the hotline for four years now. (The counselors shared only their first names, based on the hotline's policy to keep their staff anonymous.) One morning this year, her first two calls were from a 21-year-old whose parents were unaccepting of her partner and from a man deep in debt. Then came a call from a regular — a grandmother in her 70s who lives with her son and his wife and two children. As soon as they all leave for work and school, she calls to complain that they're annoying her. Usually, counselors like Lakmini are trained not to offer advice, but just be a supporting ear. It's different when the caller is suicidal. Her most difficult regular caller has been a 33-year-old woman who wants to have a sex change, but her family is not accepting. About six months ago, she began planning to ride her bike onto the track of an incoming train. Her family restricted her movements. ""I have a mother at home, but she doesn't listen,"" she told Lakmini at the end of the first call. ""You are like a mother. Can I call you sometimes?"" And she does. Sometimes, the callers have poison in hand as they speak. Mangalika, a 70-year-old former nurse who does three shifts a week, encountered such a person on her second call as a volunteer. ""I am talking to you with my poison in my hand,"" a middle-aged man told her. His wife was screaming in the background: ""He is not listening to me!"" The man, deeply in debt, said he was fed up with the daily humiliation. Mangalika, nervous, did enough to persuade him to put down the poison and go to the hospital. Three months later, the couple called again — to share good news. They had started a small shop and life was better. Leafing through the log book kept by the volunteers makes it clear that, at times, the calls have little or nothing to do with mental health. In January, a pregnant woman from Western Province called because her water was breaking and she did not have credit on her phone to call her husband at work. Could they call her husband, please? They did, and gave her a toll-free number for an ambulance. From an entry in 2014, a young girl who was about to get married called and asked for help with how to get things ready for the wedding. Days later, she called again and said she had recorded her conversation with the counselor. Listening to it repeatedly brought her peace. One of the first counselors to come on board was Munas, 57, a marriage counselor and chairman of a mediation board in Kegalle city. He and his wife, a science teacher, have five children. Twice a month, he leaves home at 4:45 a.m. and walks to a bus station for the three-hour ride to Colombo. One of Mr. Munas's most difficult calls was with a 30-year-old ethnic Tamil woman from a corner of the country devastated by the war. Relatives had stopped her from jumping with her infant daughter in front of a train, and they dialed the hotline. Her husband was an abusive alcoholic and she had painful kidney problems, she said. She couldn't see a way to keep going. But Mr. Munas was able to persuade her to try. When the call was over, he took a break. ""I drank a glass of water, walked for about 10 minutes to empty my head,"" he said. ""Then I came back."" At the end of his day, Mr. Munas boards the bus again, for a commute that will deliver him back home past midnight. Asked what brings him to make the long journey all these years, his eyes glistened, his face brightened. From the pocket of his immaculate Chinese-collared shirt, buttoned to the top, he pulled out a business card. On the back was a verse of the Quran: ""Saving one life is like saving the whole of humanity."""
News,2018-12-11,It is one of the most potent and feared weapons in the arsenal of modern American politics: the super PAC.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/us/politics/democrats-2020-super-pac.html,1689," It is one of the most potent and feared weapons in the arsenal of modern American politics: the super PAC. But as three dozen Democrats ponder presidential runs in 2020 and begin to design their campaign infrastructures, some leading names beyond Senator Bernie Sanders are expected to forgo or disavow these fund-raising committees that allow allies to haul unlimited sums from wealthy backers. The hope of these potential candidates is that grass-roots donors and progressive activists would reward them more handsomely in the primary for rejecting such funds. If she runs, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is likely to reject the assistance of a super PAC, according to two people familiar with her thinking. And the former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. revealed in a little-noticed passage in his 2017 book that he would have gone without one if he had run in 2016, making it more difficult for him to backtrack now. The question is a politically vexing one. The financial firepower would be alluring to those with a ready network of financiers, such as Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is seen as likely to have a super PAC, according to donors, strategists and people close to him. Some allies are already discussing possible super PACs for Senators Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, the two most Democratic donor-rich states in the nation. But aides to both of them say they are not currently seeking these fund-raising vehicles. The choice will represent one of the earliest and potentially more consequential crossroads of the nascent primary, and has been the subject of fierce debate within the inner circles of some candidates. Is it worth giving up possible seven-figure checks for the chance to campaign more effectively as the candidate of the little guy? Or, put another way, can a Democrat risk embracing millionaires and billionaires in an era when small donors and the party's seemingly ascendant left wing may pummel PAC-backed candidates as allies of the rich? ""Every Democrat should approach the idea of a super PAC in the primary with caution,"" said Robby Mook, who served as the 2016 campaign manager for Hillary Clinton. ""They are a liability as much as a strength."" It's no secret why these political action committees can be so appealing. Federal law currently caps contributions for presidential primary campaigns at $2,700. Campaign cash in 2020 is expected to be tight in what could be a historically crowded field. In contrast, donors face no limits with super PACs. But opposition to big money has become a galvanizing force in Democratic politics. Democrats such as Representative Beto O'Rourke, the failed Texas Senate candidate now mulling a 2020 run, have turned their rejection of corporate and PAC funds into a tidal wave of small-dollar donations. Mr. Sanders inveighed against the influence of big money and raised more than $230 million in 2016. The risk for any 2020 Democrat is that reliance on a billionaire-backed super PAC becomes a litmus test of liberal credibility as a reformer. ""If you're depending on a super PAC to succeed in the primary,"" Mr. Mook warned, ""you're probably losing."" The laws governing these committees are complex. Candidates do not formally create or control them, giving contenders some rhetorical wiggle room to disavow them while still benefiting from them. Other politicians send signals to big donors by keeping a top strategist walled off from the campaign who then starts a super PAC, which all but declares it an authorized endeavor. That, for example, is what Jeb Bush did in the 2016 race, as supporters poured in $120 million, more than was donated to any other PAC backing a candidate. Though super PACs aligned with particular candidates played major roles in the 2012 and 2016 Republican nomination fights, Democrats have not held a wide-open presidential primary featuring multiple, big, candidate-specific super PACs since the Supreme Court unshackled such spending in 2010. Strategists inside multiple potential 2020 operations described active discussions on the big money conundrum. Some call the notion of skipping out on one foolish. Others, even within the orbit of the same candidate, disagree sharply on the risks and rewards. What if one of the billionaire candidates — the financier Tom Steyer, Howard Schultz of Starbucks or the former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg — gets in? What if your candidate wins an early state but fund-raising doesn't pick up fast enough to buy the ads needed by Super Tuesday or in a state like California that has jumped earlier on the primary calendar? ""You have to know you have the big donors ready to write those checks,"" Julianna Smoot, a former top fund-raiser and deputy campaign manager for Barack Obama, said of the decision to bless a super PAC. Mr. Biden wrote in his 2017 book that he thought through the super PAC question carefully as he considered a 2016 run, saying it was ""tempting to play the game."" ""For the first time in all my years of campaigning, I knew there was big money out there for me,"" he wrote. ""But I also knew people were sick of it all."" Perhaps no potential Democratic candidate counts more billionaire potential financiers as friends or allies than Mr. Booker, who attended Stanford and wooed investments from Silicon Valley when he was Newark mayor, including a $100 million donation for schools from Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. When Mr. Booker helped open a start-up years ago, investors included Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn. He also has close ties to the family of Donald Sussman, one of the party's most generous givers. Mr. Booker officiated the wedding of one of Mr. Sussman's daughters; another hosted a fund-raiser for him at her Hamptons home last summer. Mr. Booker's team declined to comment, though people close to him said no steps had been taken to create a super PAC. Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the Vermont senator would disavow any super PAC support if he runs, as he did in 2016. Mr. Longabaugh also cautioned that super PACs could ""boomerang"" against those who have them: ""It will be an issue in the campaign."" ""You can't on one hand oppose Citizens United and the corrupting influence of corrupting money,"" Mr. Longabaugh said of the court decision that helped pave the way for super PACs, ""and on the other hand take that money."" The 2016 Republican primary showed just how fast money could flow into super PACs — in increments as large as $10 million. In that campaign, the super PACs aligned with Mr. Bush, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal and Rick Perry all outraised the actual candidates themselves. Those candidates had something else in common: They all lost. The calculation can be complicated. Both Ms. Gillibrand and Ms. Harris, for instance, have deep relationships with home-state donors who could finance them. But both have also invested heavily in creating a digital network of small donors ahead of a possible run. ""At this point, Kirsten hasn't made a decision on whether she will be a candidate for president, nor is she looking to create any outside spending if she does,"" said Glen Caplin, a spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand. Lily Adams, a spokeswoman for Ms. Harris, said much the same: ""She has not decided whether she is running for president, but there are no plans for a super PAC for a prospective candidacy."" There is ample gray area for politicians to explore or exploit, as super PACs, by definition, are formed independently, providing candidates some plausible deniability if and after they emerge. For Ms. Harris, there have been discussions in California of a super PAC that would include two former top advisers to her past campaigns, Brian Brokaw and Dan Newman, according to people familiar with the matter. For Ms. Gillibrand, Ross Offinger, a former fund-raiser for the New York senator, has quietly been reaching out to donors to feel out interest in a pro-Gillibrand super PAC, floating the name of Bill Hyers, who ran Ms. Gillibrand's first campaign for the House in 2006 and served as Martin O'Malley's campaign manager in 2016, according to a person familiar with the calls. ""We would discourage any activity of this type at this point,"" Mr. Caplin said. In some cases, strategists have floated the idea of delaying the creation of super PACs until deeper in the race to minimize blowback; of course, that risks donors deciding not to cut checks later. In Texas, Mr. O'Rourke broadly denounced super PACs throughout his Senate bid, but some still got involved late to attack his Republican opponent. The outside spending did not seem to smudge the reputation of Mr. O'Rourke, who raised record sums online. In 2012, Ms. Warren struck a deal with her Republican opponent to denounce super PACs and give away money to charity if they got involved. People close to her said that she is unlikely to seek super PAC assistance in 2020 and that she is unlikely to endorse any candidate who would if she does not run. In Ohio, there is already a ""Draft Sherrod Brown"" effort in the works for the Democratic senator, organized by his former finance chairman, Michael Wager, and Nan Whaley, the mayor of Dayton. Mr. Wager said the effort could eventually become a pro-Brown super PAC. Almost every would-be campaign has been quietly gauging donors on their level of commitment. Guy Saperstein, a Democratic donor in California who publicly pledged $1 million for a pro-Warren super PAC in 2016 if she challenged Mrs. Clinton, said he had attended two recent dinners with Ms. Warren and he ""had some feelers from some people associated with her"" about if he would support her if she ran this time. (Mr. Saperstein said he had ""begged"" advisers to Mr. Sanders to set up a super PAC in 2016. They refused.) Like so many donors, Mr. Saperstein is not ready to commit in 2020 — yet. ""I'll probably give to Bernie and Elizabeth to start out the primaries,"" he said. ""Then I'll sit back and wait to see how things develop."""
News,2018-12-11,"PARIS — The need to accelerate growth has long been visible in almost every corner of the French economy, from dreary unemployment offices packed with job seekers to businesses whose financially stretched customers struggle to make do.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/business/france-economy-macron.html,1261," PARIS — The need to accelerate growth has long been visible in almost every corner of the French economy, from dreary unemployment offices packed with job seekers to businesses whose financially stretched customers struggle to make do. President Emmanuel Macron came into office pledging to change all that by improving the country's long-term prospects. But his halting response to a month of violent demonstrations by the so-called Yellow Vest movement over social inequality has clouded his efforts for a revival. Four weekends of mass protests in Paris and in towns and villages across France have hampered economic activity while hurting the country's image with investors, the government said Monday. The same day, the country's central bank trimmed its growth forecast for the fourth quarter to 0.2 percent from 0.4 percent, well off the sluggish pace expected for the year. Businesses have sustained more than 10 billion euros, about $11.4 billion, in damage and lost sales, a figure that will probably grow. ""It's a catastrophe for business,"" Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister, said Sunday as he toured Paris businesses smashed up by rioters. ""It's a catastrophe for our economy,"" he added, a point he pressed again on Tuesday in a briefing with a small group of reporters. Mr. Macron has helped to fuel much of the current turmoil. Until Monday, he had remained silent for more than a week as he and his ministers put together a response to a movement that began with anger over a gas tax and grew into a collective outcry over declining living standards and eroding purchasing power. Moving to douse a restless nation's ire, Mr. Macron acknowledged on Monday that he had given the appearance of being out of touch with ""left behind"" France, although he stopped short of apologizing. He pledged tax cuts and financial support for those having trouble getting by, urged businesses to give employees year-end bonuses and said the government would help minimum-wage earners with a €100 monthly supplement starting next year. Mr. Macron's speech, a recorded message just 13 minutes long, was also notable for what he left out. He did not mention changing course on the most business-friendly overhaul of the French labor market in decades. The omission was a signal to investors that, despite the recent chaos, Mr. Macron plans to stick with his strategy for re-energizing Europe's third-largest economy by pursuing changes that had stalled for more than a decade. ""We know how important it is for us to be as attractive as possible for foreign investors,"" Mr. Le Maire told reporters on Tuesday. ""The key point is to make clear that we will remain strong on structural reforms."" While foreign investment in France has risen since Mr. Macron came to office, ""there will be a mark left by this episode,"" said Olivier Marchal, the chairman of Bain & Company France. ""And it's not a given that this will succeed in calming the dissatisfaction of a part of the population."" Many of those protesting understand that improving the economy is a long-term project, but their concerns are focused on their monthly efforts to make ends meet. On social networks, some protesters said Mr. Macron's offer fell short. His mostly unyielding attitude underscores the stakes for France as he eases business regulations to seed dynamism. His plans include altering the country's strict labor code to encourage hiring, and making budget adjustments during his first year in office that hit low-income earners and retirees especially hard, even as he cut taxes for wealthy people. Mr. Macron's business-friendly policies have lured Amazon, Facebook and other multinational companies to increase their investments in France. But the changes could take years to yield results for the average worker. Mr. Macron's concessions, including scrapping a much-reviled gas tax increase and abandoning some taxes on low-income workers and retirees, will cost €10 billion to €15 billion and will probably push France's budget deficit over a European Union cap of 3 percent of gross domestic product. France's borrowing costs, a measure of the country's credit risk for investors, jumped Tuesday to the highest level in 10 years amid concerns over the deficit. Mr. Macron has lectured leaders of other eurozone countries — especially Italy — about the need to balance their books. Now he must follow his own advice. French ministries have been ordered to find cuts in their budgets, and the government could delay some tax cuts for companies that had been scheduled to kick in next year, Mr. Le Maire said. Mr. Macron also refuses to end a tax break for wealthy citizens that he granted upon taking office. He says the measure was intended to lure money into France, where it can be invested in French companies. The move has drained more than €3 billion from France's coffers this year, but Mr. Le Maire said Tuesday that there was no data yet to show whether it was having the promised stimulus effect. Mr. Le Maire has suggested another way to make up the shortfall: pursuing the taxes that he said Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google had avoided paying in France for years. The European Union is considering a plan to impose such taxes. If the union does not reach an accord on doing so by March, Mr. Le Maire said Tuesday, France will move to collect $500 million in back taxes from the tech giants. Patrick Artus, chief economist at Natixis Bank, which is based in Paris, said that even if the tax cuts and spending increases Mr. Macron had proposed increased France's budget deficit, ""markets will accept that"" as a price for restoring social stability. Still, the slowdown in growth caused by a month of disruption will make it harder for Mr. Macron to address several major problems. He has pledged to reduce France's stubbornly high unemployment rate, a major source of unrest, from above 9 percent, where it has lingered for nearly a decade. That will be harder to do if the economy, which had already slowed to a 1.8 percent annual pace, continues to cool. Retailers, including supermarkets and sellers of luxury goods, have collectively lost more than €1 billion, while small and medium-size companies have lost at least €10 billion, according to France's main retail and business associations. The agriculture sector is facing over €13 billion in losses, said ANIA, the main industry group, citing four weekends of protests that blocked roads, causing delivery delays and often preventing groceries from reaching stores. Tourism has also been affected, with hotels recording cancellation rates as high as 25 percent since the protests started last month. American and Japanese tour operators have been advising customers not to travel to France, according to the National Federation of Tourist Offices. Some companies have paused hiring plans. Auchan, a large supermarket chain, said it might not hire 4,000 temporary workers it had planned to employ across France for the holiday season. The French Economy Ministry said over the weekend that it would provide emergency support for companies affected by the protests in the form of extended deadlines for tax payments, flexible short-term financing from banks and expedited insurance declaration procedures. Stores that need to make up for lost revenue will be allowed to open on Sundays, something that has been prohibited in most of France by decades-old laws requiring that Sunday be a day of rest. In the end, the main issue for France is not the short-term cost from the demonstrations, said Mr. Artus, the economist. ""It's whether Macron will keep the reforms going,"" he said. ""What's important is to maintain the attractiveness of France."""

Sign up here. A Morgan Stanley survey of 101 investors and 168 bank loan officers indicates that although investors believe their financing decisions are balanced, in reality they are highly skewed: • Nearly 80 percent said they think minority and women business owners get either the appropriate amount of capital or more, considering what their business models suggest they deserve. • The median investment by equity investors in all businesses is nearly $1 million. For those owned by women, it's just $213,000. And for minority-owned companies, it's $185,000. A big problem: getting in the door. Investors are nearly three times as likely to review business opportunities pitched by men ""very frequently"" as those pitched by women — even though men are only 1.5 times more likely to own a business. • Investors could do more to change the dynamic. Of those polled, nearly 40 percent of men said investing in businesses owned by women was not a priority; 31 percent of white investors said it was not a priority to invest in minority-owned businesses. Investors use different standards to judge female entrepreneurs and those from minority backgrounds. They expect to be disproportionately impressed by the confidence and pitch quality of women compared with that of their white male counterparts, while perceiving their companies as riskier investments. Morgan Stanley suggests steps that could help level the field, including setting targets for the number of minority- and women-owned businesses receiving investment, changing the criteria used to evaluate businesses, and increasing transparency in the decision-making process. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain on Monday postponed a parliamentary vote on her plan for splitting from the European Union. Or, as Stephen Castle of the NYT puts it, she made ""a humiliating retreat that left the country's economic and political future uncertain, and revealed her tenuous hold on power."" The problem: The U.K. is still struggling to find a route out of the E.U. that maintains useful political and economic ties with the bloc while sparing the nation's economy from disaster. Mrs. May's proposal has not convinced British lawmakers that a Brexit on those terms is possible, and the delay in the vote has heightened speculation about a no-confidence vote that could oust her from power. What happens next? Good question. Here's a flow chart to make sense of the options available to Mrs. May. But Britain's current political paralysis hints that a no-deal Brexit — a worst-case scenario — remains a possibility. For her part, Mrs. May has embarked on a whistle-stop diplomatic tour of Europe to help gain support that could persuade Parliament to vote through her deal. In the meantime, the pound is hurting. The currency sank on yesterday's news to $1.26, almost its lowest level since April 2017. In fact, the FT notes, the pound's volatility is such that Chris Turner, the head of currencies strategy at ING, says it is now trading ""more in line with the characteristics of an emerging market currency."" Investors jumped on long-term bonds instead. The patent fight between Apple and Qualcomm hit new heights Monday: Qualcomm said a Chinese court had ordered Apple to stop selling older iPhone models in China; Apple disagreed and said it would continue to sell all of its iPhone models there. The back story: Apple and Qualcomm have been battling in court for two years. Qualcomm, which historically sold chips to Apple but had been excluded from Apple's latest models, has filed a series of patent suits against the smartphone giant in multiple countries. The suits came after Apple sued Qualcomm early last year challenging its patent-licensing practices. The news: Qualcomm said a Chinese court ruled on Nov. 30 that Apple had infringed on two Qualcomm patents and had issued a preliminary injunction barring Apple from selling the iPhone 6S, the iPhone 6S Plus, the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 8, the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X in China. The ruling did not apply to Apple's three newest iPhones, the XS, XS Max and XR. Why it matters: Since Apple reported earnings on Nov. 1, a number of its suppliers have issued profit warnings, and President Trump has said iPhones could be affected if he imposes another round of tariffs. Apple's stock is down more than 20 percent since the beginning of October. A ban on sales in China would be more bad news. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Twitter's Jack Dorsey have been through their grillings. Today, Sundar Pichai, Google's C.E.O., gets his turn to be questioned by the House Judiciary Committee. What he'll say: According to his prepared testimony, Mr. Pichai will explain how the company gives its users ""choice, transparency, and control"" on privacy issues, and that ""these values are built into every product we make."" (Google is shutting down the consumer branch of its Google Plus social network because a security flaw revealed user data, a problem that escalated yesterday.) He will also explain that the company is run ""without political bias"" — despite criticism that it suppresses conservative views — and is ""proud"" to work with the government (although it has withdrawn from a Defense Department project under employee pressure). What he'll be asked: Expect Mr. Pichai to be hit with many of the same privacy-related questions that Facebook, in particular, has been confronted with: How does it track users, target advertising and maintain market dominance? And what does he have to say about Google's slow response to security issues? Also expect some tough questions about the company's plans to work in China. Follow the action throughout the day at the NYT's live briefing. After slipping by nearly 2 percent in early trading, the S&P 500 finished Tuesday up 0.2 percent. Technology companies, especially Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, led the rebound. Banks, notably, didn't recover. Explaining the markets' volatility is becoming increasingly complicated. But John Authers of Bloomberg Opinion gives it a try: If you wanted to stitch together a narrative to explain all this, I would say intensifying worries about world trade, a number of different data points, and the rising political risks in Europe prompted a sell-off in stocks outside the U.S., but also helped to engineer a sufficient downward shift in rate expectations to trigger buying in the U.S. That rescued the tech sector, but it left the financials, which are not helped by lower rates or a flat yield curve, in an even worse state. More: Almost half of S&P 500 stocks are now in a bear market. But while the stock market may have wiped out its 2018 gains, if you step back, it's still riding high. While much of Silicon Valley has tied itself in knots over whether to take on government contracts, one company is pressing on. Palantir, which uses software to analyze data and was founded with the help of $2 million from the C.I.A.'s venture capital arm, renewed a $38 million contract with Homeland Security Investigations, a directorate of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. H.S.I., which is responsible for fighting transnational criminal organizations that illegally exploit U.S. travel, trade, financial and immigration systems, uses Palantir software for data analysis. Employees of Microsoft, Google and Amazon have all lobbied their companies not to pursue government contracts; the Palantir news may stoke further conversation in Silicon Valley about the ethics of doing such work. In an emailed statement, Palantir told DealBook: There are two major divisions of ICE with two distinct mandates: Homeland Security Investigations, or H.S.I., is responsible for cross-border criminal investigations. The other major directorate, Enforcement and Removal Operations, or E.R.O., is responsible for interior civil immigration enforcement, including deportation and detention of undocumented immigrants. We do not work for E.R.O. Earlier this year, Alex Karp, Palantir's C.E.O., told Andrew: ""We're proud that we're working with the U.S. government.""

A red carpet scattered with Swarovski crystals led the way to an evening full of fairy tales and elegance, escapism and surprises. Starting with the arrival of a beaming Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, wearing a one-shouldered black velvet evening gown and stroking her pregnant belly. Almost all of the 4,000 guests assembled inside the Royal Albert Hall, one of London's grandest buildings, were stunned when the duchess emerged to present Clare Waight Keller, the artistic director of Givenchy, with the award for British designer of the year for women's wear. The pairing did make a certain amount of sense, given that Ms. Waight Keller designed the dress the duchess wore when she married Prince Harry in May. Still, royalty doesn't often make an appearance at the Fashion Awards, organized annually by the British Fashion Council.  ""It is such a pleasure to be here, celebrating British fashion and designers, in my new home, the U.K.,"" the duchess said, drawing cheers from the crowd. ""We have a deep connection to what we wear. Sometimes it's deeply personal, sometimes it's emotional. And tonight it is about supporting and empowering each other, especially as women."" Praising the ""vision and creativity, but also incredible kindness"" of a visibly stunned and tearful Ms. Waight Keller, the duchess added that ""the culture of fashion was shifting, it feels, from one where it was cool to be cruel, to one where it is now cool to be kind."" The two women, both appearing elated, then embraced. While the overall atmosphere was one of celebration and optimism, this year was also marked by heightened emotions (perhaps understandably, given the unease that surrounds the future of every British industry, including fashion). Richard Quinn, winner of the award for British emerging talent in women's wear, cried softly as he accepted his prize and thanked his parents. Not so quiet was Vivienne Westwood, who was presented with the Swarovski award for positive change in recognition of her work on humanitarian and environmental issues. ""I have a plan to change the world, but I really do need you to help me, I can't do it on my own,"" Ms. Westwood said in a rambling speech that touched on issues as varied as the rotten financial system to climate change, the shortcomings of the president-elect of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, and the recent ""Yellow vest"" protests that have swept through Paris and other French cities in recent weeks. ""Nothing will work until we urgently change the system, the system is totally broken and time is running out,"" Ms. Westwood declared, before being gently ushered offstage by the model Jerry Hall. And so it went. The fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, who received the Isabella Blow award for fashion creators from Kate Moss and Penélope Cruz, spoke to the hundreds of fashion students sitting in the rafters, pushing them to follow their passion at a time when London's ability to maintain its reputation as a melting pot of young talent seems up in the air. (The fashion awards ceremony is also a fund-raising bash for the British Fashion Council's Education Foundation, which provides design scholarships and supports apprenticeships). ""I came to Britain as an immigrant with dreams of being an artist too,"" Mr. Alas said. ""Your guts are your guns. Keep fighting for your vision and have fun, like I did."" It's a sentiment that was echoed by Miuccia Prada, who received the outstanding achievement award after 40 years as the creative leader of her family company; Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino, designer of the year; Kim Jones, Dior Men's artistic director, winner of the Trailblazer award; Kaia Gerber, surrounded by her family, who scooped the prize for model of the year; and Virgil Abloh, artistic director of men's wear at Louis Vuitton, who took home the Urban Luxe award for his work at Off-White.  But it was Ms. Waight Keller who summed it up best. ""This is just an incredibly special moment,"" the British designer, 48, said, after paying tribute to Hubert de Givenchy, and honoring her team at the French fashion house, as well as the Duchess of Sussex. ""This woman is so amazing,"" Ms. Waight Keller said as guests whispered about the possibility of seeing more ""Markle Sparkle"" in the fashion world in the future. ""I have got to know Meghan on such a personal level. And to have someone like that trust you in an incredible moment in their life — their wedding day — is just the most unbelievable honor. I can't thank you enough, but thank you again. Thank you, thank you, thank you."""
News,2018-12-12,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.],https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/nyregion/bloomberg-construction-fraud-kickback-charges.html,776," [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] A contractor working at Bloomberg company offices in Manhattan sent a text to an executive who helped oversee the work, asking a seemingly innocuous question: ""How was the sandwich?"" But this was not a query about lunch, according to indictments unsealed Tuesday in State Supreme Court. The papers described a wide-ranging scheme involving three companies to steal at least $15 million from Bloomberg L.P., the giant financial information and media company, through bribes, kickbacks and bid rigging. Among the conspirators, ""sandwich"" was code for bribes or kickbacks, prosecutors said. The contractor wanted to know if the executive, Vito Nigro of Turner Construction, was satisfied with the thick envelope stuffed with cash that had been delivered to his office the prior day, according to the indictment. Mr. Nigro and the contractor were among the 14 people charged with grand larceny, bribetaking, bid rigging, money laundering and falsifying business records relating to work at Bloomberg offices at 120 Park Avenue and 919 Third Avenue. The defendants all pleaded not guilty in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and were released on bail. Three companies were also charged in the scheme and pleaded not guilty. The indictments on Tuesday came after a two-year investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office and the State Police. Prosecutors said contractors coveted work for Bloomberg because the company ""pays extremely well and it pays on time."" Executives at both Bloomberg and Turner Construction routinely steered contracts to favored electrical contractors, vendors and others in exchange for cash, favors, or work on their homes, the indictments said. The executives and contractors in turn inflated the cost of their work for Bloomberg by millions of dollars. The executives were fired in October 2017 as investigators seized records and computers at their offices. The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance, described it as a ""brazen"" scheme that was nonetheless successful over the course of a decade. His office has repeatedly prosecuted companies for similar schemes, which he contends contribute to ""New York's sky-high construction costs."" ""This is a major cost for businesses and taxpayers,"" Mr. Vance said in an interview. ""Hopefully, this will spur corporations to invest in prevention strategies, auditing."" Prosecutors said that more than a dozen individuals and companies had already entered guilty pleas in connection with the conspiracy and paid about $5.5 million in restitution. Some of those contractors are cooperating with investigators and providing evidence against the people arrested on Tuesday. At the arraignment, Assistant District Attorney Christopher Beard described Anthony Guzzone, Bloomberg L.P.'s former global head of construction, as the ""capstone on this pyramid of corruption."" Mr. Guzzone reaped not only millions of dollars in cash kickbacks, prosecutors said, but contractors also did work to convert his New Jersey home to a ""palace,"" installing iron gates and a custom-designed outdoor barbecue, among other things. Alex Spiro, Mr. Guzzone's lawyer, challenged the prosecutors' case, suggesting the ""bare bones"" indictment was light on evidence of Mr. Guzzone's alleged wrongdoing, aside from references to lunch meetings and a custom bar. From almost the day Bloomberg recruited Mr. Guzzone more than 15 years ago, prosecutors said, he was looking to enrich himself by stealing from the company. At first, Mr. Guzzone was responsible for maintenance contracts at Bloomberg offices, including its headquarters, and he demanded kickbacks in exchange for steering work to vendors, prosecutors said. But when he was promoted to global head of construction, prosecutors said, Mr. Guzzone expanded the fraud, colluding with Ronald Olson and Mr. Nigro, executives at Turner Construction, as well as contractors and vendors. The scheme went undetected for years, prosecutors said, because the people with oversight responsibility to guard against criminal activity — Mr. Guzzone at Bloomberg and Mr. Olson and Mr. Nigro at Turner — were in on it. Prosecutors said that Mr. Guzzone even came up with the idea in 2008 of creating an electrical contractor, Litespeed Electric, to obtain some of the work. Mr. Guzzone was a silent partner in Litespeed, which was formed with executives from Bloomberg's former electrical contractor, including Robert Fleming, who was indicted Tuesday along with his wife, Donna Fleming, and three colleagues. According to the indictment, Litespeed padded its bills. By 2017, when the scheme collapsed, Litespeed had gotten roughly $250 million in contracts for Bloomberg offices. At the same time, Mr. Guzzone and Mr. Fleming named Donna Fleming as a no-show company president so Litespeed could compete for contracts as a woman-owned company. The company's lawyer, Mark Agnifilo, said, ""Litespeed categorically denies that it stole a dime from Bloomberg."" Investigators say the investigation is continuing."
News,2018-12-12,"CBS News reached a legal settlement with three women who accused the network of not doing enough to stop one of its anchors, Charlie Rose, from sexually harassing them.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/business/cbs-settles-lawsuit-charlie-rose.html,446," CBS News reached a legal settlement with three women who accused the network of not doing enough to stop one of its anchors, Charlie Rose, from sexually harassing them. The three women had worked for either Mr. Rose or CBS when he was a host of ""CBS This Morning"" and a correspondent for ""60 Minutes."" The network fired Mr. Rose last year after The Washington Post published the stories of several women who said that Mr. Rose had treated them inappropriately when they worked for him over the course of several decades. PBS, the longtime home of the ""Charlie Rose"" interview show, also cut ties with Mr. Rose. Three recent employees — Katherine Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei — sued the network and Mr. Rose this year after another article in The Post indicated that the network had ignored complaints from CBS employees who worked with him. Christa Robinson, a spokeswoman for CBS News, said on Tuesday that the CBS lawsuit was ""resolved"" and that the financial terms of the settlement were confidential, at the request of the women. Although CBS is no longer a defendant in the lawsuit, the women are continuing to pursue their claims against Mr. Rose, a lawyer for the women, Kenneth Goldberg, said. The settlement is the latest domino to fall in the reckoning over whether CBS and other television networks did enough to stop senior executives and broadcast personalities from harassing younger employees. Last week, The New York Times reported that Leslie Moonves, the former chief executive of CBS, had destroyed evidence pointing to his own sexual misconduct when he was running the network. A draft of a report by lawyers hired by CBS said the company had justification to deny Mr. Moonves his $120 million severance. Mr. Moonves stepped down from his post in September after several women came forward in The New Yorker with sexual misconduct claims against him. In the lawsuit against Mr. Rose and CBS, some of the former anchorman's subordinates said the network had known about the allegations against Mr. Rose before they became public and did nothing. Ms. Wei said in the suit that she had expressed her concerns to the executive producer of ""CBS This Morning,"" Ryan Kadro. She claimed to have told him, ""I'm telling you in case you have a lawsuit on your hands."" At the time the suit was filed, CBS said in a statement, ""We will vigorously defend against the allegations pertaining to CBS News and Mr. Kadro."" In a separate statement when the suit was filed, a lawyer for Mr. Rose, Bob Bodian, said, ""The claims in the lawsuit filed today against Mr. Rose are without merit."""

Here's how the likely new speaker approached the combative conversation. • As Democrats gear up for 2020, candidates are questioning whether they should use super PACs. But for those from donor-rich states like California and New York, the choice represents one of the earliest and potentially more consequential crossroads of the nascent primary. • The Trump administration is planning a series of actions this week targeting China's trade, cyber and economic policies out of a growing concern that China will not easily change its practices — including a pattern of hacking into American companies and throwing up trade barriers to American goods. • Some of Mr. Trump's judicial nominees have been deemed unqualified by the American Bar Association, and others have proved racially divisive. The support behind their nominations shows how far Senate Republicans are willing to push the boundaries to transform the judiciary. • A top G.O.P. official in North Carolina said that a new election in the state's Ninth Congressional District might be necessary after reports that early voter data was improperly leaked in Bladen County, where state officials are already investigating possible electoral fraud. • Lawyers for Michael T.

Kelly, telling reporters that he was in ""no rush"" and that the search process could drag on for weeks. • Reverting course, Senator Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote on a substantial criminal justice bill before the end of the year. Mr. Trump is now on the cusp of claiming one of the first truly bipartisan legislative achievements of his presidency. • The Senate easily passed an ambitious $867 billion farm bill, rejecting stricter work requirements for food stamp recipients embraced by the House and the president.

News,2018-12-12,"BEIJING — China said on Wednesday that a Canadian former diplomat who was detained in Beijing had been employed by an organization that was “not registered in China legally,” citing a law passed in 2016 that has had a chilling effect on the work of foreign charities, universities and nonprofit groups in the country.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/world/asia/china-michael-kovrig-detained.html,1235," BEIJING — China said on Wednesday that a Canadian former diplomat who was detained in Beijing had been employed by an organization that was ""not registered in China legally,"" citing a law passed in 2016 that has had a chilling effect on the work of foreign charities, universities and nonprofit groups in the country. The assertion was China's first official comment on the detention of Michael Kovrig, senior adviser for Northeast Asia for the International Crisis Group, an independent nongovernmental organization that tries to defuse international conflict. Officials, however, made no official statement confirming the detention, and they did not detail any more specific accusations against Mr. Kovrig, whose fate has further roiled relations between China and the United States and the West. Late Wednesday, The Beijing News, a state-owned newspaper, said the state security agency in Beijing was investigating Mr. Kovrig on ""suspicion of activities that endanger China's national security."" The report could not immediately be verified, but it signaled the possibility that Mr. Kovrig could be prosecuted on more serious charges. Canadian officials said Wednesday they had learned of a second Canadian, Michael Spavor, who may have been detained by China. ""We are aware of a Canadian who got in touch with us because he was being asked questions by Chinese authorities,"" Chrystia Freeland, Canada's foreign minister, said at a news conference. ""We have not been able to make contact with him"" since then. ""We are working very hard to ascertain his whereabouts,"" she added. ""We have also raised this case with the Chinese authorities."" The opacity surrounding the two cases sharply contrasted the public proceedings that unfolded over three days in a Vancouver courtroom following the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, the Chinese technology company that the United States has accused of violating sanctions against trade with Iran. After three days of hearings, Ms. Meng was released on bail Tuesday evening, pending further court deliberations on whether she should be extradited to the United States. ""I am in Vancouver and back to my family,"" she wrote on Wednesday afternoon Beijing time in a post on Weibo, China's social media platform. ""I am proud of Huawei and I am proud of my motherland."" Mr. Kovrig's detention was seen as clearly linked to the events in Vancouver — even by those defending China. State media explicitly threatened retaliation over the weekend, summoning the ambassador from the United States and warning Canada it would pay ""a heavy price."" ""The highly sensitive situation stemmed from Canada arresting Meng Wanzhou,"" Hu Xijin, the editor of the English-language edition of the Communist Party-run Global Times, wrote on Twitter after the International Crisis Group announced Mr. Kovrig's arrest. Still, Mr. Hu insisted in the same posting that ""no evidence suggests this is Chinese government's retaliation."" The Huawei case has already deeply strained the truce President Trump and China's leader, Xi Jinping, negotiated at the meeting of the Group of 20 industrialized nations in Argentina on Dec. 1, though officials on both sides have signaled a willingness to restart talks to resolve the broader trade disputes between the two countries. Mr. Trump himself, in an interview with Reuters, suggested that he would willingly intervene in Ms. Meng's case, even though it would put him at odds with his own Justice Department, which coordinated her arrest with the Canadians. ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made — which is a very important thing — what's good for national security — I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump's administration nevertheless added to the turbulence in relations with China by disclosing new details linking Beijing to the hacking of personal information of 500 million guests of the Marriott Hotel chain. Officials told reporters in Washington that the administration planned to unveil still more punitive measures targeting China's trade, cyber and economic policies. The move, following a series of high-profile indictments, reflects growing frustration among American officials over China's failure to abide by a pact Mr. Xi made with former President Barack Obama to halt cyber espionage conducted on behalf of Chinese corporations. ""There is broader recognition that you cannot yet believe China will keep its promises,"" Alex Joske, a cybersecurity expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said in a telephone interview of the Marriott disclosures. ""Calling out China publicly sends a very strong message domestically and to other countries that you are willing to take a tough stand."" ""Whether that is effective,"" he added, ""remains to be seen."" In China, analysts viewed the fast-unfolding events as part of an effort by the Trump administration to position itself for a coming trade deal. Chen Dingding, a professor at Jinan University in Guangzhou, dismissed the charges surrounding Marriott as part of Washington's ""bargaining strategy."" ""I don't think it's a big obstacle,"" he said. ""Nothing is as important as the trade talks — for both sides."" With Mr. Kovrig's detention, China suggested it was prepared to play tough as well. It is acting in response to what officials here consider to be aggressive and politically motivated moves by the Americans. Mr. Kovrig was detained on Monday night by the Beijing bureau of the Ministry of State Security, the International Crisis Group said on Wednesday. [China has a long history of arresting or holding foreigners for mysterious reasons.] ""In this case, if I.C.G. personnel conduct activities in China, then that will already violate Chinese law,"" Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said at a regularly scheduled briefing on Wednesday, though he did not mention Mr. Kovrig by name. Asked directly if the International Crisis Group was registered in China, Mr. Lu replied: ""It is not registered in China legally."" Under toughened restrictions imposed on nongovernmental organizations in 2016, people conducting work for an unregistered group would be violating the law, he added. The new law has been widely criticized for stifling civil society even further in China. Not long after it was introduced, the authorities arrested a rights advocate from Taiwan, Lee Ming-cheh, after he crossed the border from Macau to the mainland. Under the law, people working for organizations that are not properly registered can be detained for 10 or 15 days. They can be deported, but also charged with other criminal offenses. Mr. Lee was held incommunicado for 68 days before appearing in court and ultimately confessed to charges that he had ""subverted state power""; he was sentenced to five years in prison. The International Crisis Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its legal status in China, but its president, Rob Malley, said Mr. Kovrig had not engaged in illegal activities. ""I am not willing to speculate as to the reason the Chinese authorities chose to do what they did,"" Mr. Malley said. ""I am willing to state categorically what is not the reason for Michael's detention. He did not engage in illegal activities. He was not endangering Chinese national security."" Mr. Kovrig, who has written extensively on China's foreign policy challenges since joining the group in 2017, himself sensed a worrisome deterioration in relations with the United States. ""Everything will be more painful now, so we'll have to set guardrails, find areas where cooperation is still possible and try to keep competition from degenerating into something worse,"" Mr. Kovrig wrote on Twitter only two weeks ago."
News,2018-12-12,BEIJING — Missionaries. Corporate investigators. Billionaires. Legal activists.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/world/asia/china-foreigners-detained.html,661," BEIJING — Missionaries. Corporate investigators. Billionaires. Legal activists. China has a long history of arresting or holding foreigners for mysterious reasons, often in a tit-for-tat play to put pressure on overseas rivals. In recent years the number of such detentions has increased, a disturbing trend for foreigners visiting or conducting business in the country. The Chinese government has detained two prominent foreigners in recent days: Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a Canadian writer and entrepreneur. They are the latest foreigners to be held by the authorities, in what some experts said might be retribution for the arrest of a senior Chinese tech executive in Canada this month. Here are some recent cases of foreigners caught in the cross hairs of China's opaque legal system. Kevin and Julia Garratt, Christian aid workers from Canada, were best known in Dandong, a Chinese city near the border with North Korea, for operating a popular coffee shop. They also worked with a charity that provided food to North Koreans. But in 2014, they were arrested by the Chinese authorities on ""suspicion of stealing and spying to obtain state secrets."" Ms. Garratt was released on bail and allowed to leave China. Mr. Garratt spent two years in prison before his eventual release. Both have denied the accusations. Legal experts say that the Chinese government might have arrested the Garratts in hopes of pressuring Canada into releasing Su Bin, a Chinese aviation entrepreneur who was being held in Vancouver, after the United States accused him of stealing military data and sought extradition. Chinese officials have denied that the Garratts' arrest was related to Mr. Su's case. On a January morning last year, Xiao Jianhua, one of China's most politically connected financiers, was escorted out of the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong in a wheelchair by unidentified men. Mr. Xiao had rare insight into the financial holdings of China's most powerful families, having made his fortune investing in banks, insurers and real estate. Mr. Xiao, a Chinese-born Canadian citizen, is now believed to be in custody in the mainland, helping the authorities with investigations into the finance industry, though the government has not specified the reasons for his abduction. Peter Humphrey, a British private investigator, and his wife, Yu Yingzeng, a Chinese-born American citizen, ran a small consulting firm in Shanghai that specialized in ""discreet investigations"" for multinational companies, focusing on issues like counterfeiting and embezzlement. But as an investigation by the Chinese government into fraud and corruption at GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical maker, escalated in 2013, Mr. Humphrey and Ms. Yu, who advised the firm, came under scrutiny as well. The couple were arrested and charged with violating the rights of Chinese citizens by obtaining private information. Mr. Humphrey and Ms. Yu served prison sentences of about two years. Peter Dahlin, a Swedish citizen, was the co-founder of a nongovernmental organization in Beijing that provided legal aid to Chinese citizens. His work soon caught the attention of the authorities, who were cracking down on foreign nongovernmental organizations and human rights lawyers. In early 2016, Mr. Dahlin was detained and interrogated for 23 days by China's Ministry of State Security. He was forced to record a confession and to apologize on national television. Then he was deported. Liu Changming, a former executive at a state-owned bank in China, is among China's most-wanted fugitives. He is accused of playing a central role in a $1.4 billion fraud case. He fled the country in 2007. Now, in what some describe as a bid to lure Mr. Liu back, the Chinese government is preventing his wife and children, who are American citizens, from leaving China. Mr. Liu's wife, Sandra Han, and their children, Victor and Cynthia, arrived in China in June to visit an ailing relative. Ms. Han was detained, and the children have been held for months under a practice known as an exit ban."
News,2018-12-12,"Michael D. Cohen, a former lawyer for President Trump, was sentenced to three years in prison on Wednesday after denouncing Mr. Trump and explaining that “I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/nyregion/michael-cohen-sentence-trump.html,1486," Michael D. Cohen, a former lawyer for President Trump, was sentenced to three years in prison on Wednesday after denouncing Mr. Trump and explaining that ""I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds."" Mr. Cohen gave an emotional apology to the court for his involvement in a hush-money scandal that could threaten the Trump presidency — a scheme to buy the silence of two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump to protect his chances before the 2016 election. Mr. Cohen said his blind loyalty to Mr. Trump led him to ignore ""my own inner voice and my moral compass."" The sentencing in federal court in Manhattan capped a startling fall for Mr. Cohen, 52, who had once hoped to work by Mr. Trump's side in the White House but ended up a central figure in the inquiry into payments to an adult-film star and a former Playboy model before the 2016 election. Judge William H. Pauley III called Mr. Cohen's crimes a ""veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct"" and added, ""Each of the crimes involved deception and each appears to have been motivated by personal greed and ambition."" He added that Mr. Cohen's particular crimes — breaking campaign finance laws, tax evasion and lying to Congress — ""implicate a far more insidious harm to our democratic institutions."" ""As a lawyer, Mr. Cohen should have known better,"" the judge said. Mr. Cohen had pleaded guilty in two separate cases, one brought by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, the other by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Before he was sentenced, a solemn Mr. Cohen, standing at a lectern, sounded emotional, but resolved, as he told the judge he had been tormented by the anguish and embarrassment he had caused his family. ""I blame myself for the conduct which has brought me here today,"" he said, ""and it was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man"" — a reference to Mr. Trump — ""that led me to choose a path of darkness over light."" Mr. Cohen then apologized to the public: ""You deserve to know the truth and lying to you was unjust."" Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, called Mr. Cohen's assertion he had acted out of loyalty to Mr. Trump ""a complete lie."" ""I feel sorry for him,"" Mr. Giuliani added. ""He's a pathetic serial liar."" Federal agents raided Mr. Cohen's office and home in April, and he later turned on Mr. Trump, making the remarkable admission in court that Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange the payments. Mr. Trump at first denied knowing anything about the payments, but then acknowledged that he had known about them. This week, he insisted that the payments were ""a simple private transaction"" — not election-related spending subject to campaign-finance laws. He also maintained that even if the hush-money payments were campaign transactions in violation of election law, that should be considered only a civil offense, not a criminal one. Since Mr. Cohen came under investigation, Mr. Trump has mocked him as a ""weak person"" who was giving information to prosecutors in an effort to obtain leniency when he is sentenced. In fact, Mr. Cohen did not sign a formal cooperation agreement with the United States attorney's office in Manhattan or with Mr. Mueller. In addition to the campaign-finance violations, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to charges of tax evasion, making false statements to a bank and lying to Congress. He took a calculated gamble in pleading guilty to this litany of federal crimes without first entering into a cooperation agreement with the government. He offered to help prosecutors, but only on his terms, and there were some subjects he declined to discuss. His lawyers argued he should not serve time in prison. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said he deserved around four years. Judge Pauley had the final say. The judge said Mr. Cohen's assistance to the special counsel's office, though useful, did not ""wipe the slate clean,"" and a ""significant term"" of prison was justified. Six Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel. In the end, the judge gave Mr. Cohen three years for the crimes he committed in New York and two months for lying to Congress, to be served at the same time. He was also asked to pay nearly $2 million in fines, forfeitures and restitution. The judge ordered Mr. Cohen to begin serving his sentence on March 6. Mr. Cohen's sentencing was unusual because it involved guilty pleas he had made in cases brought by the two separate prosecutors. In the case brought by Mr. Mueller's office, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the duration of negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, as well as about the extent of the involvement of Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen revealed that Mr. Trump was more involved in discussions over the potential deal during the election campaign than previously known. Mr. Cohen's three-year sentence is the first substantial prison term in a case stemming from Mr. Mueller's inquiry. The special counsel had referred the case to the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, where it was overseen by Robert S. Khuzami, the No. 2 official there, who attended the hearing on Wednesday. The investigation of Mr. Cohen by the United States attorney's office in Manhattan burst into public view in April when the F.B.I. raided his office, apartment and hotel room. Agents hauled off eight boxes of documents, about 30 cellphones, iPads and computers, even the contents of a shredder. Four months later, on Aug. 21, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, tax evasion and making false statements to a financial institution. Mr. Cohen admitted in court that he had arranged the payments ""for the principal purpose of influencing the election"" for president in 2016. The payments included $130,000 to the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, which the government considers an illegal donation to Mr. Trump's campaign since it was intended to improve Mr. Trump's election chances. (The legal limit for individual contributions is $2,700 in a general election.) Mr. Cohen also admitted he had arranged for an illegal corporate donation to be made to Mr. Trump when he orchestrated a $150,000 payment by American Media Inc. to a former Playboy playmate, Karen McDougal, in late summer 2016. Prosecutors in Manhattan wrote last Friday to Judge Pauley that Mr. Cohen, in arranging the payments, ""acted in coordination with and at the direction"" of Mr. Trump, whom they referred to as Individual 1. On Nov. 29, charged by Mr. Mueller's office with lying to Congress, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty again. The two prosecuting offices each wrote to Judge Pauley, offering sharply contrasting portrayals of Mr. Cohen. The Southern District depicted him as deceitful and greedy and unwilling to fully cooperate with its investigation. Mr. Mueller, on the other hand, said Mr. Cohen had ""gone to significant lengths to assist"" the Russia investigation and recommended that he receive some credit for his help. Mr. Cohen's lawyer, Guy Petrillo, made an impassioned plea for leniency, citing his client's courage in cooperating with the Russia inquiry, which he said was ""of the utmost national significance,"" comparing it to Watergate. He added: ""He came forward to offer evidence against the most powerful person in our country,"" without knowing what the result would be, how the politics would play out, or whether ""the special counsel would even survive."" Jeannie Rhee, a prosecutor from Mr. Mueller's office, with which Mr. Cohen met seven times, told the judge that Mr. Cohen had accepted responsibility for the lies he told Congress and had provided ""credible and reliable information about core Russia-related issues."" But a Manhattan prosecutor, Nicholas Roos, said of Mr. Cohen's cooperation that as much as he ""claims he's done for the republic, the same can be true in the way in which he's undermined it."" In the end, Judge Pauley seemed to side with the defense. He said that ""cooperation, even when it is not the product of a formal agreement, should be encouraged"" when it advances a criminal investigation. ""Our system of justice would be less robust without the use of cooperating witnesses to assist law enforcement,"" the judge said. Shortly before Mr. Cohen and his family and friends walked out of the courtroom, roughly 20 minutes after the sentencing had ended, he briefly addressed a cluster of reporters who were waiting in an anteroom between the courtroom and the hallway. ""This is my last time talking to you guys,"" he said abruptly, then said nothing more. He and his lawyers waited briefly in the courthouse lobby while his wife, son and daughter, left the building, passed through a huge gantlet of television crews and photographers outside, and climbed into a waiting black Infiniti QX60. Cohen then walked out of the building with a hangdog expression and made a silent beeline to the car."
News,2018-12-12,"Seven years ago, a younger and more carefree Mark Zuckerberg went onstage at Facebook’s annual developer conference and announced a major change to the social network’s design.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/technology/tech-friction-frictionless.html,1465," Seven years ago, a younger and more carefree Mark Zuckerberg went onstage at Facebook's annual developer conference and announced a major change to the social network's design. Until then, apps connected to Facebook would regularly ask users if they wanted to publish their latest activity to their feed on the social network. Those pop-up messages — from apps like Spotify, Netflix and The Washington Post — were annoying, Mr. Zuckerberg said, so the company had created a new category of apps that could post directly to users' feeds, without asking for permission every time. ""From here on out, it's a frictionless experience,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. Of all the buzzwords in tech, perhaps none has been deployed with as much philosophical conviction as ""frictionless."" Over the past decade or so, eliminating ""friction"" — the name given to any quality that makes a product more difficult or time-consuming to use — has become an obsession of the tech industry, accepted as gospel by many of the world's largest companies. Airbnb, Uber and hundreds of other start-ups have made billions of dollars by reducing the effort needed to rent rooms, hail taxis and complete other annoying tasks. And when a company fails, excessive friction is often cited as the reason. ""If you're making the customer do any extra amount of work, no matter what industry you call home, you're now a target for disruption,"" Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the cloud storage company Box, wrote in a 2012 essay. There is nothing wrong with making things easier, in most cases, and the history of technology is filled with examples of amazing advances brought about by reducing complexity. Not even the most hardened Luddite, I suspect, wants to go back to the days of horse-drawn carriages and hand-crank radios. But it's worth asking: Could some of our biggest technological challenges be solved by making things slightly less simple? After all, the frictionless design of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which makes it trivially easy to broadcast messages to huge audiences, has been the source of innumerable problems, including foreign influence campaigns, viral misinformation and ethnic violence abroad. YouTube's most famous frictionless feature — the auto-playing function that starts another video as soon as the previous one has finished — has created a rabbit-hole effect that often leads viewers down a path to increasingly extreme content. And many major security breaches, like the one that recently exposed the data of as many as 500 million Marriott guests, might have been more easily contained if these systems had been more compartmentalized and less tailored for seamless operation. ""The internet's lack of friction made it great, but now our devotion to minimizing friction is perhaps the internet's weakest link for security,"" Justin Kosslyn, a product manager at Jigsaw, a part of Alphabet that focuses on digital security, wrote last month in an essay for the technology site Motherboard. Over the past several weeks, I've spoken to more than a dozen designers, product managers and tech executives about the principles of frictionless design. Many said that while making products easier to use was usually good, there were cases where friction could be useful in preventing harm, and steering users toward healthier behavior. Bobby Goodlatte, a former Facebook designer who is now an angel investor, told me that the tech industry's culture of optimization ""presumes that reducing friction is virtuous unto itself."" ""It leads us to ask, 'Can we?' — never 'Should we?'"" he said. Several people praised the Time Well Spent movement spearheaded by Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, as a kind of pro-friction cohort within the tech industry. Among other things, the group has successfully pressured companies like Facebook and Apple to take steps to curb tech addiction by including features that encourage users to limit their screen time. And a few lamented that in the tech industry's race for convenience, something important had been lost. ""We wanted to juice engagement and therefore made things as frictionless as possible,"" said Jenna Bilotta, a design manager who has worked at Google. ""We made a whole world of the literal 'least you could do' apps, and it's trashing people's mental health."" Often, invoking the concept of friction is a useful way to obscure some larger, less savory goal. For Facebook, ""frictionless sharing"" was a thinly veiled cover for the company's true goal of getting users to post more often, and increasing the amount of data available for ad targeting. For YouTube, auto-playing videos have sharply increased view time, thereby increasing the platform's profitability. And for Amazon, tools like one-click ordering have created a stunningly efficient machine for commerce and consumption. ""Our current application of tech has been to take something hard and make it easy,"" said Harper Reed, an engineer and the chief technology officer for President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. When tech companies do make their products harder to use, it's generally to secure them from hackers, spammers or other malicious actors. (Think of the security Captchas that require users to solve math problems or pick out photos of traffic lights, or the way YouTube requires new users to verify their phone numbers before uploading videos longer than 15 minutes.) There are signs that some tech companies are beginning to appreciate the benefits of friction. WhatsApp limited message forwarding in India this year after reports that viral threads containing misinformation had led to riots. And YouTube tightened its rules governing how channels can earn ad revenue, to make it harder for spammers and extremists to abuse the platform. More of these kinds of changes would be welcome, even if they led to a short-term hit to engagement. And there are plenty of possibilities. What if Facebook made it harder for viral misinformation to spread by adding algorithmic ""speed bumps"" that would delay the spread of a controversial post above a certain threshold until fact checkers evaluated it? Or if YouTube gave users a choice between two videos when their video finished, instead of auto-playing the next recommendation? Or if Twitter discouraged abusive pile-ons by making it harder for people who haven't followed an account for a set number of days to reply to that account's tweets? This approach might seem overly paternalistic. But the alternative — a tech infrastructure optimized to ask as little of us as possible, with few circuit breakers to limit the impact of abuse and addiction — is frightening. After all, ""friction"" is just another word for ""effort,"" and it's what makes us capable of critical thought and self-reflection. Without it, we would be the blob people from ""Wall-E,"" sucking down Soylent while watching Netflix on our self-driving recliners. ""Imagine you run a social network and you're trying to aggregate all the trending stories based on what all users are clicking,"" Mr. Harris, the Time Well Spent founder, told me recently. ""Would you prefer to jack the plug into each person's reptilian brain to aggregate those stories, or would you prefer to jack the plug into their calm, reflective brain that is considering the consequences downstream?"" There may even be a business case for complexity. Consider what happened to Tulerie, a New York start-up that makes a platform that allows women to share designer clothing. Tulerie's co-founder Merri Smith told me a fascinating story from the company's early days. In the beginning, Ms. Smith said, the company invited women to join via a brief Google survey, which it emailed to hundreds of prospective members. ""We wanted to create as little friction as possible, while still having to vet these people,"" she said. But only one person filled out the survey. So Ms. Smith and her co-founder decided to try a more complicated approach. Anyone who wanted to join had to conduct a brief video call with a company employee first. Logically, the new strategy should have failed. But it was a huge hit. Prospective members flooded the invite list, filling up the company's interview schedule weeks in advance. By creating a more complex sign-up, Tulerie had signalled that its service was special and worth the effort. ""It goes back to values,"" Ms. Smith said. ""People perceive it as harder to get into, and they want to be a part of it."" I don't want to romanticize the slow, often frustrating processes of the past. There is nothing inherently good about complexity, and the tech industry could still do a lot of good by reducing friction in systems like health care, education and financial services. But there are both philosophical and practical reasons to ask whether certain technologies should be a little less optimized for convenience. We wouldn't trust a doctor who made speed a priority over safety. Why would we trust an app that does?"
News,2018-12-12,"Stocks briefly clawed back into positive territory for the year on Wednesday, as Beijing and Washington both hinted that they could make concessions to strike a deal on trade.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/business/markets-theresa-may-trump-shutdown.html,582," Stocks briefly clawed back into positive territory for the year on Wednesday, as Beijing and Washington both hinted that they could make concessions to strike a deal on trade. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 stock indexes all rose after President Trump said in an interview with Reuters that he would intervene in the Department of Justice case against a prominent Chinese telecommunications executive, if it would help secure a deal over trade. Separately, The Wall Street Journal reported that China was drafting a policy to replace its Made in China 2025 program to offer foreign companies greater access to the Chinese market. The headlines initially sent stocks sharply higher, with the S&P 500 rising more than 1.8 percent, but the rally faded through the afternoon. The benchmark finished with a daily gain of 0.5 percent, and down 0.84 percent for 2018. Wednesday's session was the latest bout of volatility for markets that have grown increasingly sensitive to political developments. On Tuesday, stocks sank after a White House photo opportunity turned into rancorous debate between Mr. Trump and Democratic congressional leaders that raised the prospect of a government shutdown in the next few months. Last week, markets careened on headlines related to the trade war, rising and falling with the latest developments. That Monday, the S&P 500 jumped 1.1 percent on word that Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had agreed to a 90-day truce to the trade war. The next day, the S&P tumbled 3.2 percent as the president, calling himself ""a Tariff Man"" in a Twitter message, seemed to restart the conflict. That turbulence has continued into this week. In currency markets on Wednesday, the pound whipsawed after Conservative lawmakers in Britain, who are angry about the handling of the country's exit from the European Union, tried to gather the votes necessary for a no-confidence vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's role as party leader. Ms. May overcome that opposition late Wednesday. The FTSE 100 was up about 1 percent, and the Euro Stoxx 50, a measure of European blue-chip companies, was up 1.9 percent. Asian markets also rose, with Japan's Topix closing up 1.99 percent and the Nikkei 225 up 2.15 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1.61 percent, while the CSI 300 index of Chinese blue-chip stocks finished 0.34 percent higher. The recent volatility in stocks has been fueled by concerns about the simmering trade war between the United States and China. Negotiators have been working on an agreement under which China would commit to buying $1.2 trillion more in American goods and services over the next several years. But the ability to reach a deal may be undermined by a broader United States crackdown on China that targets Beijing's trade, technology and economic policies. The relationship between the two countries had already been complicated by the arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer at the Chinese technology company Huawei, at the request of the United States. Ms. Meng, who is under scrutiny for her role in Skycom Tech, a Hong Kong company that does business in Iran, was released on bail on Tuesday. Mr. Trump told Reuters that he might involve himself in the case. ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made — which is a very important thing — what's good for national security — I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" he said."

Here's the sign-up.] It's Wednesday. Good luck trying to get arrested at City Hall. Weather: Yep, still chilly (it's the ninth day in a row below normal), with a high of 40. Alternate-side parking: in effect till Christmas. Two potent forces may be on a collision course: big Tech (Amazon) and the grass-roots left (supporters of Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). The City Council will hold a public hearing at 10 a.m. today on Amazon's plan to use nearly $3 billion in state and city subsidies to open a major office in Long Island City, Queens. The Times's J. David Goodman, who will cover the hearing, has an overview of what to expect. Team Amazon: The company has already hired a small army of well-connected lobbyists, including a former Queens city councilman, Mark Weprin. Mr. Weprin was at City Hall on Monday, conferring with lawmakers. The opposition: Amazon is ""facing even more energized opposition from the grass-roots network that helped push Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to victory in a neighboring congressional district in Queens,"" Mr. Goodman reports. A key component of her winning coalition was the New York City Democratic Socialists of America. ""A lot of people who volunteered for the campaign are now organizing with us against Amazon,"" said Aaron Taube, a member of the group. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez herself has repeatedly denounced the Amazon deal as wasteful. Why it matters: Last month, a lawmaker told me that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez scares local lawmakers, who see her as the vanguard of an army of activists who could launch primary challenges to Democratic lawmakers deemed insufficiently progressive. If her supporters oppose the deal, local lawmakers may feel they also need to. But: There's no evidence at this point that the deal is threatened. Both the governor and the mayor strongly support it. And a recent poll showed that the public does, too. Michael Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer, is to be sentenced at 11 a.m. today in Federal District Court in Manhattan, after implicating Mr. Trump in a hush-money scandal that could threaten his presidency. Our reporters will be in the courtroom. Here's their preview. The Times's Andy Newman reports: On July 19, 1918, an armored cruiser called the U.S.S. San Diego was 10 miles off the coast of Fire Island, N.Y., when an explosion ripped a hole in the hull. The 15,000-ton San Diego sank, taking the lives of six sailors. It was the only major warship the Navy lost in World War I. It was never definitively determined what sank the San Diego — a mine, a torpedo or something else — until Tuesday, when the Navy announced the results of a two-year investigation. The study involved archaeological research, flood modeling and 3-D mapping. The San Diego, the Navy said, was destroyed by a mine laid by a German U-boat. Navy officials even think they know the culprit: U-156, a submarine linked to the sinking of 44 ships. Sign mystery: Hundreds of complaints flooded in about New York store signs. But from whom? Charges dropped: The Brooklyn mother who had her baby ripped from her arms by the police was released from Rikers Island. ""I Just Love White Men"": A white man aimed a racist rant at Columbia University students of color. Nice work if you can get it: One Brooklynite's social media followers pay for his rent, food, clothes and weed. R.I.P., famed geologist: The ""rockconteur"" Sidney Horenstein championed the rock the city is built upon. Broadway: A ""menacing,"" ""darkly revisionist"" version of ""Oklahoma!,"" finally!

Yes, that was Ariana Grande you just saw. The ""Thank U, Next"" singer was the celebrity most often painted in New York this year by the hand-paint-only advertisement company Colossal Media. She was featured on five walls in Brooklyn and Manhattan, for three campaigns: for Reebok, Spotify and YouTube. In Brooklyn: One mural was 743 square feet of paint at Kent Avenue and Grand Street; another was more than 2,000 square feet on two walls by Wythe Avenue and North Fifth Street; a third was 628 square feet at Bogart Street and Grattan Street. In Manhattan: 1,566 square feet at Wooster and West Houston Streets. If that sounds like a lot of paint, it is. A Colossal employee said it's enough to paint the entire length of an L train. Not that anyone would ever do such a thing. Make Wednesday picture perfect. Dear Diary: It was the 1980s. Microwave ovens were ubiquitous and affordable, and I wanted one. The Lower East Side was an ideal place to shop for appliances in those days. Competition among the small retail stores in the Canal Street area was fierce, and bargaining for the best price was common. Armed with the brand name and model number of the microwave oven with the highest rating from Consumer Reports, I entered a store filled to the ceiling with boxes. Salesmen scurried about, answering customers' questions. I caught the attention of a man who looked old enough to be one of the bosses. He hollered a command and a box with the microwave I wanted landed in front of me. Then, working an old calculator on the counter, he gave me a price. ""Too high,"" I said. He offered to take 5 percent off. It was still out of price range, I whispered in a confessional tone. He lowered his glasses and looked me in the eye. ""What kind of work do you do?"" he asked. ""I am an architect,"" I said. He seemed delighted. ""You are just the man I am looking for,"" he said. ""That's nice,"" I said. ""What can I do for you?"" ""I want you to design a mausoleum for my mother-in-law."" ""May she rest in peace,"" I said. ""Did she pass away a long time ago?"" ""Who said that she is dead?""

News,2018-12-12,"HONG KONG — Hong Kong prosecutors said on Wednesday that they would not pursue charges against the territory’s previous leader, who had received millions of dollars from a company that also had a contract with the city’s subway system.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/world/asia/hong-kong-leung-chun-ying.html,411," HONG KONG — Hong Kong prosecutors said on Wednesday that they would not pursue charges against the territory's previous leader, who had received millions of dollars from a company that also had a contract with the city's subway system. The former leader, Leung Chun-ying, who was Hong Kong's chief executive from 2012 to 2017, came under suspicion in 2014, when it emerged that the Australian company UGL had agreed to pay him $6.4 million. UGL has extensive connections with the MTR Corporation, which runs Hong Kong's subway, and held a longstanding contract then worth about $41.9 million to maintain 120 train cars. The allegations of conflict of interest added to calls for Mr. Leung's ouster during the Umbrella Movement, the large-scale street protests in 2014 calling for more open democracy. Hong Kong's anti-graft body, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, investigated Mr. Leung's dealings with UGL. But the Department of Justice said it had decided that the results were insufficient to warrant prosecution because there was ""no reasonable prospect of conviction of a corruption charge against Mr. Leung."" The 2011 deal for UGL to pay Mr. Leung was part of a sale of a company that he had once run. While the arrangement was made before he became chief executive, the money was paid out while he was in office. The Hong Kong government owns 75 percent of MTR and appoints its chairman. But the company said that it had not awarded any new contracts to UGL before Mr. Leung's arrangement was revealed. Mr. Leung said he had no oversight of day-to-day transportation policy, and MTR said contracts were reviewed by board members without knowledge of the bidder's names. Still, the multimillion-dollar payments added to growing criticism of Mr. Leung, who was consistently less popular than his predecessors and left office without pursuing a second term. Holden Chow, a pro-establishment lawmaker, was also investigated for allegedly working with Mr. Leung to interfere with a legislative investigation into the deal. The Department of Justice said on Wednesday there was insufficient evidence to charge Mr. Chow with misconduct in public office. Mr. Leung returned to the public eye this summer, when he criticized the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents' Club for inviting the head of a pro-independence party to give a talk. The political party was later banned by the government, and Victor Mallet, a Financial Times editor who hosted the talk, was expelled from Hong Kong in what was widely seen as retribution for staging the event."
