Op-Ed,2018-01-01,President Trump is vowing to return to two of his favorite goals in 2018: a crackdown on immigration and the dissolution of the Affordable Care Act.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/opinion/tom-brokaw-health-care-immigrants.html,747," President Trump is vowing to return to two of his favorite goals in 2018: a crackdown on immigration and the dissolution of the Affordable Care Act. When congressional Republicans passed the sweeping tax bill in December, they eliminated the A.C.A.'s health care mandate. But President Trump wants to knock out the entire program. As I have learned in the past four years, immigration and health care in America have an organic relationship that may escape the president and his supporters if they experience health care only from the outside looking in. I've been an active pilgrim in our medical culture, as a cancer patient, a kidney stone carrier, a victim of a mysterious vertigo condition and the owner of a battered elbow resulting from a hard fall on a New York City street. What I've learned is that American health care is a universe of scientific genius and selfless compassion populated by what seems to be the most diverse population in the country. Spinal surgeons of Russian origin and American training, Ecuadorean eye specialists, Chinese imaging experts, Kazakh physical therapists, East Indian oncologists and an elegant orthopedist from Bologna (we traded New York Italian restaurant recommendations) — I've met them all. It is not just New York hospitals that are an ethnic ""purée,"" as an Argentine nurse at Sloan Kettering described the mix to me. Most large metropolitan hospitals are staffed by dedicated workers from just about every continent. Rural American patients welcome well-trained Pakistani and East Indian physicians in private practice and small-town clinics. In the middle of white-bread Minnesota you'll see employees of the Mayo Clinic scurrying through the corridors in Muslim head scarves and Sikh turbans. I was consulting with a Nebraska-born neurologist, the son of a grain elevator operator, while a Mayo-trained Kenyan émigré expertly drew my blood. The diversity of our health care system isn't just about immigrants. In rural America, homegrown physicians worry that their commitment to small communities is being severely tested by hospital consolidations. In Powell, Wyo., I met a doctor, Nathaniel Rieb, the son of a Presbyterian minister, who is the only general surgeon in the town hospital. He stays because if he leaves, then what? Nathaniel and his wife have five children, including one severely disabled by multiple sclerosis. They met him on a mercy mission to Haiti and immediately made him part of their family. I left our encounter thinking, ""I'd like to be Nathaniel's patient and his neighbor."" One of Nathaniel's female colleagues is equally dedicated to rural medical care, especially for women. She has yet to hear much discussion of the different health care needs based on gender in the Affordable Care Act debate. My professional and personal curiosity prompts me to inquire how physicians choose their specialty. The gifted Montana trauma surgeon who expertly repaired my wife's shattered ankle explained that his father was a carpenter, so he grew up liking to fix things. My friend the writer Tom McGuane is taken with the back story of Dr. Doug Packer, one of the world's leading electrophysiologists. He rewires damaged hearts. Dr. Packer explained that his family had an auto business and at an early age he liked to tinker with the electrical systems in cars. He took that passion to Brigham Young University, the Duke Medical School and eventually the Mayo Clinic. Our eldest daughter set out to be an infectious disease physician but a season working with female Afghan refugees on the Pakistan border before medical school changed her mind. She became an emergency room doctor because she treasured interacting with patients in immediate care. As a nation, we have major political, financial and medical challenges ahead in re-organizing the 20 percent of the economy that health care represents. And, as I've learned, America remains a cherished destination for gifted and motivated physicians, researchers, nurses, stretcher bearers and wheelchair attendants from around the world. They're on the front lines around the clock, an up-close and personal experience that is critical to this monumental task. Those gifted care givers come in many colors from a rich palette of backgrounds. Their world is on a 24-hour cycle of critical decisions, complicated procedures, tender care and emotional exhaustion. We're lucky to have them. They deserve to be heard not just by their grateful patients. When the president's emissaries meet with Congress and the insurance and pharmaceutical industries to negotiate health care, our care givers, in all their diverse and compassionate glory, should be there too."
Letter,2018-01-01,To the Editor:,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/opinion/amtrak-derailment.html,330," To the Editor: Re ""Derailed Infrastructure"" (editorial, Dec. 25): The rail tragedy near Tacoma, Wash., was preventable. Why did it happen? Congress is the primary culprit. For many decades, it has appropriated billions to develop, implement and operate our air traffic control system, and it has spent even more trying to make an inherently unsafe mode of transportation — highways — a little less unsafe. But railways are essentially told to ""fix the problem with your own dollars."" Railroads in Europe began to focus on ""crash avoidance"" back in the 1930s, and today most rail systems throughout the world manage to prevent such accidents. In Japan, the high-speed Shinkansen system has operated since 1964 without a single significant-injury accident. In the United States, we pay far too little attention to crash avoidance. Congress and the Federal Railroad Administration are responsible. And the media is guilty of failing to educate. DAN MCFARLING, ALOHA, ORE. The writer is a director of the Association of Oregon Rail and Transit Advocates, a rail passenger association. To the Editor: The recent Amtrak accident may indeed provoke renewed concerns about the state of America's infrastructure. It also underscores the deficiencies in funding, which is necessary to maintain and upgrade the country's aging transportation systems. There are a number of reasons for this deficiency. Primary among them is the nature of our market economy. It favors new products and services that make old ones obsolete and can create large investment returns in relatively short order. That is why government is so central to infrastructure investment; it can override financial market considerations. American capital markets don't like investing in old businesses (except perhaps real estate) unless there is a new twist. Automation could be such a twist. Perhaps new technologies involving driverless cars (and eventually pilotless airplanes) will find their way into mainstream rail applications and generate the investment interest necessary to support broader rail modernization.

Most markets around the world will be closed on Monday, as traders get an extra day of rest. Across much of the United States, 2018 will begin with a continuation of unusually cold temperatures, according to the National Weather Service. Zach Wichter SMALL BUSINESS On Monday, recreational marijuana will become legal in California, the eighth state to legalize the drug. But because marijuana still does not have legal standing with the federal government, it can be difficult for marijuana start-ups to get funding from banks, or generally to conduct business as usual. Zach Wichter ECONOMY The Federal Reserve was full of optimism at the end of 2017. The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate at its final meeting of the year and issued a revised economic forecast predicting faster growth in 2018, citing the effects of a major federal tax cut. The Fed also said it did not anticipate raising interest rates more quickly in response to faster growth. The question is why the Fed is willing to let the good times roll. The minutes of the December meeting, which the Fed is scheduled to release on Wednesday, may provide some answers. Binyamin Appelbaum The Bureau of Labor Statistics is likely to report another month of strong job gains on Friday, when it releases December's data. It is too early to notice the effect of the new tax law, but economists expect that the unemployment rate will hold steady at 4.1 percent. Natalie Kitroeff"
News,2018-01-01,"The chief executive of the world’s biggest catering company, which is also one of Britain’s biggest businesses, died on Sunday in a plane crash near Sydney, the Australian police said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/business/sydney-compass-richard-cousins.html,544," The chief executive of the world's biggest catering company, which is also one of Britain's biggest businesses, died on Sunday in a plane crash near Sydney, the Australian police said. Richard Cousins, the chief executive of Compass Group, was among the six people killed when a seaplane went down off Jerusalem Bay, just north of Sydney, according to a statement from the New South Wales police. Police representatives confirmed that those who died were Mr. Cousins, his two sons, his fiancée, her daughter and the pilot of the plane. The cause of the crash was being investigated. Mr. Cousins, 58, led Compass for more than 11 years. The company employs more than 550,000 people worldwide, providing food for a wide range of organizations including Costco, Qualcomm, the University of Houston and the stadium that houses the Utah Jazz basketball team. ""We are deeply shocked and saddened by this terrible news,"" Paul Walsh, the company's chairman, said in a statement. ""It has been a great privilege to know Richard personally and to work with him for the last few years. Richard was known and respected for his great humanity and a no-nonsense style that transformed Compass into one of Britain's leading companies."" Police said they were working with officials from Australia's Transport Safety Bureau, which investigates transport accidents in the country. The Reuters news agency said that a preliminary report was expected within 30 days, but that it could take as long as a year to find out what had caused the crash. The flight was part of a trip conducted by Sydney Seaplanes, which has five aircraft transporting passengers on scenic trips above the Australian city, often to waterfront restaurants. The pilot, Gareth Morgan, had more than 10,000 hours of flight experience, the vast majority of which was on seaplanes, Aaron Shaw, the company's managing director, said in a statement. Sydney Seaplanes, which said it had not had any safety incidents since it started operating in 2005, suspended all its operations until further notice. Mr. Cousins had been expected to leave Compass at the end of March. His planned successor as chief executive, Dominic Blakemore, the company's chief operating officer for Europe, will take over immediately, Compass said. When Mr. Cousins took the helm of the company, it was mired in a corruption scandal, accused of bribing a United Nations official to garner contracts to supply peacekeepers. Settling lawsuits and ending investigations tied to the allegations cost the company 39 million pounds, it said in its 2007 annual report, around $53 million at current exchange rates. During his time as chief executive, Mr. Cousins increased the size of the company. Revenue more than doubled, and operating profit increased fourfold. The company's share price has increased by more than six times since he took over, to £16, or about $21.60, a share. Last year, The Harvard Business Review named him the 11th-best performing chief executive in the world. Compass had full-year revenue of £22.9 billion and profit of £1.7 billion in the most recent financial year, which ended in September. Compass says it holds 10 percent of the global food services market, operating across 50 countries. The company said in its most recent annual report that it served more than 5.5 billion meals a year."
News,2018-01-01,"LONDON — Victoria Alvarez is a ball of energy, darting around the Seven Sisters Indoor Market in north London.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/world/europe/london-tottenham-regeneration.html,1060," LONDON — Victoria Alvarez is a ball of energy, darting around the Seven Sisters Indoor Market in north London. On a recent morning, she broke away from chatting with a friend to burst into a general store in the market, asking its Iranian owner if he had some supplies she needed. She barely had time to hear his response before she was off again, standing behind the counter at her currency exchange and parcel shipping stall. In a brief quiet spell, when her husband took over, Ms. Alvarez walked across the hall to one of the market's hairdressers for a blow-dry. For Ms. Alvarez, a Colombia native who has had a stall here for 16 years and is president of a traders' association, the market is a second home. Customers can shop for groceries, get a bite to eat or a haircut, meet a real estate agent and get legal advice, all under one roof. Her daughter spent much of her youth in its hallways. ""To me, my roots are very important,"" she said. ""This is why this market is such an important part of the community."" Now, she says Seven Sisters Indoor Market — the biggest Latin American market in England, by its estimation — is under threat, caught in one of London's largest ever redevelopment programs. Traders say that they are being priced out, that local officials are riding roughshod over their complaints, and that a hub for the British capital's Spanish-speaking minority will be lost. The district surrounding the market, Tottenham, is one of London's most diverse, with more than 200 languages spoken in the area. It is centered on High Road, a three-mile stretch that is home to shops like halal butchers and Afro-Caribbean hairdressers, as well as small cafes, restaurants and markets like the one where Ms. Alvarez works. Tottenham is also one of London's most deprived districts, and the local council argues that it is in dire need of renewal. More than 10,000 people are on a waiting list for public housing. Measures of crime are higher than the London average. And proponents of the regeneration point to the 2011 London riots, which started in Tottenham, as evidence that the area's problems must be addressed. Like many poorer parts of London, the neighborhood also sits uncomfortably beside wealthy districts. People who live on the west side of Haringey, the council of which Tottenham is a part, live about nine years longer than those in the east. Students who live in the west typically perform better academically, and household incomes there are up to twice as high. The situation — with uncomfortable parallels to Grenfell Tower, the public housing block that was consumed by fire last June and that lay close to multimillion-pound homes — offers a window into the challenges facing London, a dynamic city with a strong economy, but one with a housing shortfall and which many residents can no longer afford. ""There is no place in London that is not experiencing these pressures,"" said Mark Brearley, a professor at London Metropolitan University's Cass Cities program. ""Tottenham is an illustration of a London-wide phenomenon."" If all goes to plan, though, that will soon change — and while those behind the plans hope to improve the area's prospects, many here fear being pushed out. A raft of projects are underway. The local Premier League soccer club, Tottenham Hotspur, is carrying out a 750-million pound, or $1 billion, stadium upgrade. Train and subway stations are being renovated, schools and health services upgraded, and around 10,000 new homes are being added. The Seven Sisters Indoor Market will be rebuilt. ""It is ambitious,"" said Alan Strickland, the local council member responsible for regeneration. ""The scale of the challenge is very big."" The market's traders — largely Colombian, but also from Peru, Ecuador, Brazil and parts of Africa — will be moved across the street in 2020 while the market is being upgraded. Then, a couple of years later, they will have the option to move back, according to the local council and Grainger, the company in charge of the development. Grainger acknowledges that some traders' rents will go up, but insists that they will be more affordable than those available on the open market. It has promised to hold rent increases to 2 percent for five years from 2020. Ms. Alvarez, 47, has led efforts to oppose the moves. She and her colleagues want stronger guarantees of rent control, more financial compensation and greater clarity about the plans. They have taken the fight to Britain's courts, and even got the United Nations human rights body to weigh in on their side. Many other locals also oppose the changes, which they disparagingly call gentrification. Farther along the High Road, the twin brothers who run Chick King, a fried chicken restaurant, are worried. Their small eatery has sat directly opposite the soccer stadium since they opened in 1981. But their cafe, along with a string of houses and shops, faces demolition to make way for a walkway connecting the stadium to a soon-to-be-redeveloped train station. ""The community wanted to see improvements,"" said Alex Tryfonos, one of the brothers, ""but not wholesale demolition of the area."" He agreed that Tottenham needed the new investment, and the jobs associated with it. But he and other business owners worry that the redevelopment will mean either being forcibly removed — an official report after the riots advocated having fewer, and larger, shops and restaurants — or being priced out. ""I'm not opposed to change,"" said Susan Nguyen, whose nail salon is a few doors down from Chick King, before adding: ""I would be heartbroken if I had to leave the area."" Mr. Strickland insisted that the plans would have a positive effect on Tottenham, and that there had been wide consultation with locals. And he said some of the factors at play, like London's sky-high property prices, were out of the local authority's control. Yet for Ms. Alvarez, the changes in the district are irreparably altering its distinct character and culture. Sitting down above a beauty salon to catch her breath, she said that when her fellow traders asked her what she thinks will happen, she was often at a loss for words. ""I cannot tell them that I can see the future so grim sometimes,"" she said. ""But sometimes I do. And I cry."""
News,2018-01-01,"LOS ANGELES — In late summer, Verizon Communications came to Rupert Murdoch with a surprise acquisition offer.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/business/media/rupert-murdoch-21st-century-fox-disney.html,1690," LOS ANGELES — In late summer, Verizon Communications came to Rupert Murdoch with a surprise acquisition offer. Verizon — locked in battle with AT&T, which was then finalizing its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner — wanted to buy pieces of 21st Century Fox, Mr. Murdoch's television and film conglomerate. Representatives of the two companies secretly met at least once to discuss a merger. Mr. Murdoch, 86, shrugged off the talks as uninspiring, according to an associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wanted to maintain his access to the media titan. Verizon declined to comment, but the overture prompted Mr. Murdoch to start to think seriously — for the first time — about selling his Hollywood treasures. Not only would a sale solve a business problem, it could solve a family one. Several months later, Mr. Murdoch agreed to sell much of 21st Century Fox to the Walt Disney Company. The proposed $52.4 billion deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, has the potential to radically reshape the entertainment world, but it also has many wondering what the future holds for Mr. Murdoch and the two sons who seemed to be on the cusp of taking over his vast media holdings. Mr. Murdoch had built an empire by divining where media was headed, and the landscape ahead troubled him, according to several people who speak to Mr. Murdoch or to others close to him and who insisted on anonymity. Growth for 21st Century Fox, with its mix of traditional cable networks and movie labels, would be increasingly difficult to deliver as technology giants like Apple and Amazon pushed deeper into the film and television industries, changing the way people get entertainment. Netflix was already becoming big enough to outbid Fox and other old-line entertainment companies for scripts. Facebook was coming after sports rights. 21st Century Fox had tried to bulk up to remain competitive. But its attempt to buy Time Warner in 2014 had failed. Its recent bid to become the sole owner of Sky, the British satellite television giant, has been stuck in purgatory. British regulators said in June that a sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had amounted to ""significant corporate failures,"" but added that Mr. Murdoch and his top lieutenants were ""fit and proper"" to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain. The British government is also weighing whether owning Sky would give the Murdochs too much control over British media. In recent years, Mr. Murdoch had molded a succession plan that handed his businesses to both of his sons. In 2015, he named his elder son, Lachlan, executive co-chairman, giving father and son equal standing. And he had installed his younger son, James, as chief executive of 21st Century Fox. The three would govern as one big happy family, they all insisted. But at times, James had grumbled that his role as chief executive was limited, according to three people who know him who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. His father did not relinquish much control and became more involved with the company's most important asset, Fox News, after the cable channel's pugnacious leader, Roger Ailes, was forced to resign in 2016 following allegations of sexual harassment. (Mr. Ailes died in May.) Fox News, the company's financial engine and a hugely influential platform for Republican politics, has been the source of family friction. James, who holds some progressive views, has privately expressed embarrassment about some elements of Fox News, including its sometimes skeptical coverage of climate change, according to the three people who are friendly with him, a stance not shared by his more conservative brother and father. The tension bubbled into public in August when James sent an email to a list of blind-copied recipients that repudiated President Trump for his response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va. Mr. Trump counts Rupert Murdoch as a friend and informal adviser. It was becoming increasingly clear to many analysts, investors and Hollywood agents that the three-pronged leadership structure Mr. Murdoch had put in place was not going to work over the long term. The dynamics of the Murdoch family are continuously shifting, and outsiders are kept at a distance. To Hollywood, the Disney deal looked like a family schism, with Lachlan, 46, solidly back in line to succeed his father as overseer of the family's remaining businesses and James, 45, without a clear future at Disney. Associates of James, however, say that he encouraged the deal, in part because he had grown weary of the dysfunctional push and pull with his brother and father. The Murdochs declined to be interviewed for this article. When Rupert told his sons that Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, had called him to propose a takeover, James got on board rather quickly, according to four people briefed on the sale process. Like his father, James saw the merits of the proposed deal. Mr. Iger had expertly acquired Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm and used them to make Disney into a movie, theme park and consumer products juggernaut. Adding most of 21st Century Fox's businesses would transform Disney into a colossus with a real shot at competing against the Silicon Valley giants. And the Murdoch family would be Disney's biggest noninstitutional shareholder. (Only the mutual fund company Vanguard has more shares.) Disney's offer also provided Rupert Murdoch with the opportunity to establish the like-minded Lachlan as his clear heir, putting him in a position to eventually take over Fox News, which Disney was not buying, and the family's other company, the newspaper-focused News Corporation. At first, Lachlan was unenthusiastic about discarding such a large chunk of the family's holdings, according to the four people with knowledge of the sales process. Disney would take the 20th Century Fox movie and television studio, cable networks like National Geographic and FX, and stakes in two behemoth overseas television-service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India. Lachlan understood the threat posed by the technology giants, but he saw less need to rush into Disney's arms. Most of 21st Century Fox's businesses were doing quite well. ""There is a lot of talk about the growing importance of scale in the media industry,"" Lachlan said on an earnings conference call with investors in early November. ""Let me be very clear. Fox has the required scale."" He had also just gotten his family settled in Los Angeles as part of the 2015 management arrangement. The primary property Disney was leaving behind — Fox News — was based in New York. Although Lachlan has not yet made a decision, Rupert has made it clear that he wants his elder son to run what they are calling New Fox, which will house Fox News and the other businesses left behind by Disney, including the Fox broadcast network and a chain of TV stations. ""I hope my son Lachlan will agree to be chief executive,"" Rupert said during an interview with Sky News in December. That signals a return to his original succession plan, which went awry in 2005 when Lachlan abruptly left the family business after sparring with Mr. Ailes. He decamped to Australia, where he founded and ran a successful investment company. He returned to his father's side in 2014. ""This may be his way of being immortal,"" the London-based analyst Claire Enders, who has followed the Murdochs for more than three decades, said of Rupert, ""because he clearly sees that Lachlan is the right person and shares his views and will support him for the next 10 years."" What James will do is more of a mystery. People close to him say he may try to strike out on his own. Unlike his brother, James has never worked outside the family businesses, other than the hip-hop record label he founded after dropping out of Harvard. His father bought it, bringing James into the corporate fold. A senior job at Disney is also a possibility, but there were ""no guarantees of any sort,"" Rupert said in the Sky News interview. ""He will be integral to helping us integrate these companies over the next number of months,"" Mr. Iger said on a call with investors after the deal was announced. ""Over that time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not."" Beyond the family dynamics, the deal may allow James to finally vanquish memories of his role in the phone-hacking scandal at family-owned tabloids in Britain. He was never found to have had direct knowledge of the hacking by members of the paper's staff, but a parliamentary committee accused him of ""willful ignorance"" after he acknowledged that he had failed to read emails that referred to settlement payments made to hacking victims. Moreover, James is likely to emerge with a stake in Disney worth at least $1 billion. ""That's a good return for putting up with your father for 20 years,"" Ms. Enders said. As for Rupert Murdoch, he may now turn his attention to buying local television stations to buttress New Fox and compete with Sinclair Broadcast Group, which agreed in May to buy Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. If the proposed deal with Tribune Media goes through, Sinclair will reach some 70 percent of households in the United States. It has been suggested that Rupert could look at buying stations in political swing states, where there is a lot of money to be made in political advertising during election years, to say nothing of potential influence. Some have also mused that Mr. Murdoch may try to combine New Fox with News Corporation, the owner of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. In his interview with Sky News, he brushed aside the immediate possibility. ""There's logic to it, but we're not planning it at this stage,"" he said. In any case, Mario Gabelli, a longtime media investor whose Gamco holds roughly $350 million in 21st Century Fox shares, predicted that Rupert would relish having a voice at Disney, even if the deal did not come with a board seat. ""He now becomes Disney's largest single shareholder,"" Mr. Gabelli said, ""with an ax to grind."""

To Hollywood, the Disney deal looked like a family schism, with Lachlan, 46, solidly back in line to succeed his father as overseer of the family's remaining businesses and James, 45, without a clear future at Disney. Associates of James, however, say that he encouraged the deal, in part because he had grown weary of the dysfunctional push and pull with his brother and father. The Murdochs declined to be interviewed for this article. When Rupert told his sons that Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, had called him to propose a takeover, James got on board rather quickly, according to four people briefed on the sale process. Like his father, James saw the merits of the proposed deal. Mr. Iger had expertly acquired Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm and used them to make Disney into a movie, theme park and consumer products juggernaut. Adding most of 21st Century Fox's businesses would transform Disney into a colossus with a real shot at competing against the Silicon Valley giants. And the Murdoch family would be Disney's biggest noninstitutional shareholder. (Only the mutual fund company Vanguard has more shares.) Disney's offer also provided Rupert Murdoch with the opportunity to establish the like-minded Lachlan as his clear heir, putting him in a position to eventually take over Fox News, which Disney was not buying, and the family's other company, the newspaper-focused News Corporation. At first, Lachlan was unenthusiastic about discarding such a large chunk of the family's holdings, according to the four people with knowledge of the sales process. Disney would take the 20th Century Fox movie and television studio, cable networks like National Geographic and FX, and stakes in two behemoth overseas television-service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India. Lachlan understood the threat posed by the technology giants, but he saw less need to rush into Disney's arms. Most of 21st Century Fox's businesses were doing quite well. ""There is a lot of talk about the growing importance of scale in the media industry,"" Lachlan said on an earnings conference call with investors in early November. ""Let me be very clear. Fox has the required scale."" He had also just gotten his family settled in Los Angeles as part of the 2015 management arrangement. The primary property Disney was leaving behind — Fox News — was based in New York. Although Lachlan has not yet made a decision, Rupert has made it clear that he wants his elder son to run what they are calling New Fox, which will house Fox News and the other businesses left behind by Disney, including the Fox broadcast network and a chain of TV stations. ""I hope my son Lachlan will agree to be chief executive,"" Rupert said during an interview with Sky News in December. That signals a return to his original succession plan, which went awry in 2005 when Lachlan abruptly left the family business after sparring with Mr. Ailes. He decamped to Australia, where he founded and ran a successful investment company. He returned to his father's side in 2014. ""This may be his way of being immortal,"" the London-based analyst Claire Enders, who has followed the Murdochs for more than three decades, said of Rupert, ""because he clearly sees that Lachlan is the right person and shares his views and will support him for the next 10 years."" What James will do is more of a mystery. People close to him say he may try to strike out on his own. Unlike his brother, James has never worked outside the family businesses, other than the hip-hop record label he founded after dropping out of Harvard. His father bought it, bringing James into the corporate fold. A senior job at Disney is also a possibility, but there were ""no guarantees of any sort,"" Rupert said in the Sky News interview. ""He will be integral to helping us integrate these companies over the next number of months,"" Mr. Iger said on a call with investors after the deal was announced. ""Over that time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not."" Beyond the family dynamics, the deal may allow James to finally vanquish memories of his role in the phone-hacking scandal at family-owned tabloids in Britain. He was never found to have had direct knowledge of the hacking by members of the paper's staff, but a parliamentary committee accused him of ""willful ignorance"" after he acknowledged that he had failed to read emails that referred to settlement payments made to hacking victims. Moreover, James is likely to emerge with a stake in Disney worth at least $1 billion. ""That's a good return for putting up with your father for 20 years,"" Ms. Enders said. As for Rupert Murdoch, he may now turn his attention to buying local television stations to buttress New Fox and compete with Sinclair Broadcast Group, which agreed in May to buy Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. If the proposed deal with Tribune Media goes through, Sinclair will reach some 70 percent of households in the United States. It has been suggested that Rupert could look at buying stations in political swing states, where there is a lot of money to be made in political advertising during election years, to say nothing of potential influence. Some have also mused that Mr. Murdoch may try to combine New Fox with News Corporation, the owner of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. In his interview with Sky News, he brushed aside the immediate possibility. ""There's logic to it, but we're not planning it at this stage,"" he said. In any case, Mario Gabelli, a longtime media investor whose Gamco holds roughly $350 million in 21st Century Fox shares, predicted that Rupert would relish having a voice at Disney, even if the deal did not come with a board seat. ""He now becomes Disney's largest single shareholder,"" Mr. Gabelli said, ""with an ax to grind."""
Op-Ed,2018-01-01,"On election night 2016, I gave in temporarily to a temptation I warn others about: I let my political feelings distort my economic judgment.

(Being an old-fashioned guy, I try to admit and learn from my mistakes.)",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/opinion/can-the-economy-keep-calm-and-carry-on.html,638," On election night 2016, I gave in temporarily to a temptation I warn others about: I let my political feelings distort my economic judgment. A very bad man had just won the Electoral College; and my first thought was that this would translate quickly into a bad economy. I quickly retracted the claim, and issued a mea culpa. (Being an old-fashioned guy, I try to admit and learn from my mistakes.) What I should have clung to, despite my dismay, was the well-known proposition that in normal times the president has very little influence on macroeconomic developments — far less influence than the chair of the Federal Reserve. This only stops being true when the economy is so depressed that monetary policy loses traction, as was the case in 2009-10; at that point it mattered a lot that Obama was willing to engage in fiscal stimulus, and it also mattered a lot, unfortunately, that Republican opposition plus Obama's own caution meant that the stimulus was much smaller than it should have been. By 2016, however, the aftershocks of the financial crisis had faded away to the point that the usual rules once again applied. Indeed, if we could find an economist who didn't know that there was an election in 2016, and showed her the economic data for the past couple of years, she would have no clue that something drastic happened: For that matter, economic developments in the U.S. during Trump's first year were remarkably similar to developments in other advanced countries. Europe, in particular, has at least for now emerged from the shadow of the euro crisis, and is steadily growing — if you take its lower population growth into account, it's doing a bit better than the US: So we're living in an era of political turmoil and economic calm. Can it last? My answer is that it probably can't, because the return to normalcy is fragile. Sooner or later, something will go wrong, and we're very poorly placed to respond when it does. But I can't tell you what that something will be, or when it will happen. The key point is that while the major advanced economies are currently doing more or less OK, they're doing so thanks to very low interest rates by historical standards. That's not a critique of central bankers. All indications are that for whatever reason — probably low population growth and weak productivity performance — our economies need those low, low rates to achieve anything like full employment. And this in turn means that it would be a terrible, recession-creating mistake to ""normalize"" rates by raising them to historical levels. But given that rates are already so low when things are pretty good, it will be hard for central bankers to mount an effective response if and when something not so good happens. What if something goes wrong in China, or a second Iranian revolution disrupts oil supplies, or it turns out that tech stocks really are in a 1999ish bubble? Or what if Bitcoin actually starts to have some systemic importance before everyone realizes it's nonsense? I'm not predicting any of these things, and when the next big shock comes it will probably come from some direction I haven't thought of. But when it does come, we'll need an effective, coherent response from officials beyond the world of central banking. So imagine such an event happening soon. How confident would you feel in the team of Donald Trump and Steve Mnuchin? How much leadership could a weakened Angela Merkel exert in a fragmented Europe? You might have thought that such concerns would weigh on markets even now. But for whatever reason, investors are currently in what-me-worry mode. And let's hope that they're right — that by the time stuff happens, we'll actually have non-delusional people in charge."
News,2018-01-02,"It was a tough year, but at least we got “Big Little Lies” and Tiffany Haddish.

Politics appalled a lot of us, men did too, and the Scotch tape holding the New York City subway together popped off. Not to mention, New Yorkers were handed the coldest New Year's Eve since 1962. ""I dare you,"" 2017 seemed to be taunting. ""Ring me out."" Part of me wanted to ignore the dare. New Year's, always hard for me, felt increasingly lonely. Most of my friends are married, affianced, or gobbled up by Los Angeles, or veganism. I'm 34. I'm single, and always have been. I'm a terrible dancer. And yet: there's virtue in stepping into the bracing cold, in shocking the blood awake and feeding the brain something new. After spending last New Year's crawling across Manhattan, I wanted to set foot in other boroughs — all four of them, in fact. My friend Colin agreed to join. I chose wildly disparate experiences — Cardi B, contra dancing, Vivaldi, an all-night gender-fluid party — to see if 14 hours outside of my comfort zone, in the company of strangers, might crack me open a bit for the year to come. I'm firmly an indoor person, but I thought I'd start off with a little natural splendor. We arrive for one of the Sunday afternoon guided walks of Wave Hill, with its striking views of the New Jersey Palisades. Turns out we are the only people on the tour. It's 16 degrees. Even Jon Snow would head inside. Our guide Tony takes us by the Wave Hill House. Theodore Roosevelt lived there for a while, as did Mark Twain. Blindingly cold, I see the house as shelter, and whatever cave man DNA my iPhone and homosexuality haven't overridden now compels me toward it. Later, I consider the European hornbeam tree before me, whose bare branches jut out conically, and an Asian dogwood tree, whose bark reddens in the winter. I'm heartened, seeing things thrive in misery. Trees exfoliate in the winter, Tony tells us, shedding their bark in radical self-care. I imagine them opening a nice shiraz after we've left. I'm partial to the opening credits of ""Working Girl,"" so I figured a ride on the Staten Island Ferry, bound for Manhattan on the eve of a new year, would be particularly stirring. I stare ahead at the financial district skyline, pretending the Carly Simon song is playing and I've got Melanie Griffith's hair. The air feels like daggers, but I manage. My fellow passengers feel differently. Everyone's bundled and exhausted, dressed for a Sunday commute, not New Year's revelry. As we pass the Statue of Liberty, foreign tourists pop onto the outer decks for quick photos, their fur-trimmed hoods flapping in the lacerating wind. In the bathroom, a man rests clanking bags of wine on either side of the sink before stepping to the urinals. George Cabon, 48, a street vendor from Staten Island, is on his way to Rockefeller Center with a shopping cart full of party hats and light-up glasses. This is his 10th year out on New Year's. ""It changed after Sept. 11,"" he said. ""Before that, it was like a dream job — I'm talking $1,500, $1,800 a day. Today, if you make $200, you're happy."" Jill Montesano, 20, and her boyfriend, Brenden Kranich, 20, are heading to Times Square. ""The people, that's what's going to get to me,"" Mr. Kranich said. ""Sometimes it wigs me out not being able to move. It'll be fun, though, to get to spend it with her."" ""He said no more kisses until midnight,"" Ms. Montesano said. Billed as ""New York's floating concert hall,"" Bargemusic is presenting Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" and Bach's ""Violin Concerto in A Minor"" at its home, a converted coffee barge moored by the Brooklyn Bridge. In the cozy hull, the seven-member ensemble, led by the violinist Mark Peskanov, tuned onstage in front of windows looking onto the Manhattan skyline. The audience — mostly older, white and N.P.R. tote bag-owning — filed in happily. Two couples laughing it up behind me — Lisa Love and Charlie Mendosa, and Lauren Glant and Michael Gillespie — became friends when their children dated and remained so after they split up. ""Our kids used to be involved, and now we are,"" Mr. Gillespie said. The ensemble makes a crisp and emotive meal out of the Vivaldi, as the boat rocks in the wake of all the East River booze cruises. Mr. Peskanov plays so hard he breaks a bow string during ""Autumn."" I catch the cute bassist glancing at me, and I imagine a Zankel Hall wedding, but he's probably just wondering why someone's in a ""Little Mermaid"" sweatshirt in the front row. ""It's for a '90s party later,"" I want to mouth. ""And it's my roommate's."" The ""Winter"" concerto's my favorite, and I glance at Vivaldi's sonnets, translated in the program. ""Shivering, frozen mid the frosty snow in biting, stinging winds,"" he wrote. ""This is winter, which nonetheless brings its own delights."" I'll look for the bassist on Facebook. ""Hold hands,"" the instructor says. Colin and I hold hands with the people next to us and form a circle of four. ""Circle to the left,"" she says. We circle to the left. ""And stop,"" she says. ""Get your partner across from you, and you'll be home."" We're in the lofty gymnasium at Camp Friendship where Brooklyn Contra, a volunteer-run club, is hosting a New Year's Eve contra dance. Contra is a social dance, with traces of square, swing and folk, where you're in weaving, twirling lines and constantly being flung into a new person's arms. Eye contact is key. I'm terrified, but I'm here to push myself. ""Find someone experienced to dance with,"" the instructor says. A local band called Grand Picnic plays, and Colin is whisked away. ""Will you teach me?"" I ask a woman in a scarf. ""Someone will,"" she says, already saddled with a beginner and clearly not wanting to double her burden. I do-si-do with a man named Chris, who, as he spins me, says, ""I need more resistance from you."" There's not really time to think; you just have to take people in your arms and hold their hands and look in their eyes and twirl. ""Hello! Hi! I'm sorry!"" I shout to every new partner, and most can't wait to fling me to the next. ""Release hands and turn alone,"" the instructor calls out. ""But don't turn your back on your neighbor."" ""I turned my back on you,"" the older woman next to me says, taking my hand again. ""I'm so sorry."" Benevolence! I nearly cry. Colin, still wobbly from the barge and now the twirling, gets sick. The rapper Cardi B, one of two female artists to hit the Billboard No. 1 spot in 2017, is set to perform at the Knockdown Center, an old glass factory converted into a performance and art venue. The coat check line is like Ikea on a Saturday, so we wear ours. The vaulted, concrete-floored space fills up. Women's necklines plunge in sequined and knit dresses and backless jumpsuits; men wear red tuxedo jackets, ski lodge sweaters and turtlenecks with billowing bell bottoms. A girl in a beret kneels to lick and seal a newly rolled joint, which she then holds high in triumph. The young crowd is a healthy mix of colors and persuasions, all smoking weed — Jeff Sessions's nightmare, I reckon. ""If you've got somebody who's locked away, put your cellphone lights up,"" the D.J. says, and a sea of cellphones are thrust into the air. ""If somebody's passed on, put 'em up."" More go up. ""Keep 'em up, New Year's Eve,"" he says, playing Meek Mill. Plastic flutes of free champagne line the back bars like terra cotta warriors. The crowd is lively and hands are in the air, pounding to a mash-up of Soul II Soul, Snap!, and Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock. A group of girls form a hand-held chain and first-grade-field-trip their way through the crowd. People make out: scruffy boys, a man holding his girlfriend and a bottle of Patrón, and two glam girls against the column I'd found to lean on but quickly ceded, eminent domain and all. Clumps of V.I.P.s on elevated platforms swell like sea anemone. Colin texts a guy he's flirting with. I watch Ben Platt's Instagram story. ""It's officially 60 seconds,"" the D.J. says. ""New York, make some noise."" New York obliges. ""We promise 2018 will be even crazier,"" he says. Oh God, I think, don't say that. When the clock strikes midnight, the air fills with smoke. Cardi B, now onstage, takes the mic. ""I want to thank everybody for supporting my music,"" she says, then takes a selfie video and leaves the stage. There's confusion. ""Cardi's gonna have a few drinks, give her 30 minutes,"" the D.J. says, and puts on more music. People hit the bars, Edward Scissorhand-ing multiple glasses of champagne. In the gender-neutral bathrooms, there's vomit in two out of nine sinks. By coat check, people sit on the floor checking their phones, heads drooping like week-old flowers. So far it's been a lot of ""& Friends,"" but finally Cardi B emerges, in a sparkly blazer and bra. ""What's poppin'?"" she asks. I've got a contact high and I'm about to swim to a man on a barge, that's what's poppin'. ""It's a new year, bitch,"" she says. ""There was another state that offered me more money, but I wanted to spend it in my home. So let's get it poppin'."" She throws off her blazer and launches into her hit, ""Bodak Yellow."" Fifteen minutes later, she says good night. Plastic flute shards crack underfoot as people pour out toward Flushing Avenue, log-jammed with honking Ubers. It's 10 degrees. ""We waited all that time for two or three songs?"" a woman shouts at her friend. ""We could've gone to a dive bar."" ""Would you like a free hug?"" a twentysomething in nothing but gold underwear asks me in the entrance to the House of Yes. ""Aren't you freezing?"" I say. ""I hope you're getting hazard pay."" ""I don't work here,"" he says. Inside a remix of Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" blasts while silver-leotarded dancers writhe in hanging, spinning cages. Two female go-go dancers, one in silver antlers, the other in a silver dolphin head, dance on the bar. It's a '90s-themed party, and I'd hoped for the ""Friends"" theme, or maybe an episode of ""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman."" People dance in painted suits, blazers with crew neck shirts, Nickelodeon T-shirts and half-undone overalls. Flannels hang from more than a few waists. In the side room, a circle of guys, shirtless under their unzipped Adidas tracksuits, hold hands and take turns staring into one another's eyes — future contra dancers, all. It's quiet like a waiting room on the subway, heading further into Brooklyn. ""Where are we going now?"" a girl asks her friend. ""Home,"" her friend replies. ""Sweet."" The line for the Spectrum Party at the Dreamhouse, a parquet-floored DIY queer venue, is so long there'd better be a cronut or Bette Midler in ""Hello, Dolly!"" at the end of it. ""Line bumps,"" the woman next to me says to herself, tapping a half of a teaspoon or so (I'm hoping to cook more in 2018) of cocaine onto her knuckle, then snorting it. The entryway is littered with tinsel, A.T.M. receipts, and half-full Poland Spring bottles. Inside it's like a David Lynch rumspringa, but with no choice at the end, just more of what you're doing. People stumble around like zombies, kissing and shoving — that 4 a.m. mix of inspired and incapable. It's time to go home. I did it — I left the house and heard music and saw nature and the whites of strangers' eyes. But, frankly, after 3 a.m., New Year's takes on a homogeneous blur. People stumble on, blowing at the occasion's embers long after they've gone out. There comes a time when you have to let a night, as you do a year, go. ""Bodak Yellow"" plays softly on the radio on the ride, and I, sort of, softly, sing along."
News,2018-01-02,Good Tuesday and happy new year!,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/dealbook/2018-business-trump.html,3229," Good Tuesday and happy new year! • Bitcoin's value jumped as Peter Thiel's venture firm emerged as an investor in the currency. • Regulatory concerns sink Ant Financial's purchase of MoneyGram. • The Nasdaq Composite closed above 7,000 for the first time. • Breakingviews thinks 2018 will be a frothy, frustrating year. • The analyst Gene Munster thinks Amazon should make a big leap into brick-and-mortar retail. Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. The value of the digital currency leapt about $1,000 this afternoon. Why? Turns out that the venture capitalist and his firm are believers. From Rob Copeland of the WSJ: Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm's most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $14,655. Why buy Bitcoin? Founders Fund is, after all, a venture firm rather than a hedge fund. But the firm apparently believes that start-up valuations currently are sky-high, while digital currencies will continue to climb in worth. Has Founders Fund made money? The WSJ reports, citing its unnamed sources, that the firm bought about $15 million in Bitcoin and that its stake is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. — Michael J. de la Merced So much for Jack Ma's charm offensive. United States officials have effectively killed Ant Financial's $1.2 billion bid to buy MoneyGram. Ant Financial, the electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, became the latest Chinese firm to have its acquisition of an American company fall apart because it was unable to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius. The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet. Shortly after President Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York City and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs. The attempted purchase of MoneyGram was seen as a test of the Trump administration's political and regulatory approach to China, and the deal's failure could spell trouble for other Chinese companies considering major acquisitions. The strong flow of Chinese money into the United States has prompted growing worries. Lawmakers from both parties have introduced legislation calling for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in the United States. They are pushing for a significant expansion of Cfius, a multiagency panel that reviews foreign deals for potential threats to national security. Of the deal, Richard Beales of Breakingviews writes: ""It would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People's Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam's payments infrastructure. ""For Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing's tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China's financial system. Rather than opening the door – arguably the old American way of showing how things ought to be done – CFIUS this time kept it closed. If it's a rebuke, it's one that's conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment."" MoneyGram's shares are down 6.8 percent after the close. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 percent Tuesday to close above 7,000 for the first time. The gain was driven by Netflix, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet and Apple, which jumped between 18 percent and 4.8 percent. Tuesday's rally follows a 28 percent gain for the Nasdaq last year. That beat the 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average and the 19 percent rise for the Standard & Poor's 500 index. So how stretched are valuations for the Nasdaq? As of Friday, the index was trading at 27.55 times the last 12 months of earnings, well above the S.&P. 500′s level of 18.27 times earnings, according to the WSJ's Ben Eisen. But the Nasdaq's current price-to-earnings ratio remains well below 72.2, which it hit in March 2000. Extra Credit: Yes, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.com drove the Nasdaq's run to 7,000. But Riot Blockchain saw the biggest percentage gain between the Nasdaq's first close above 6,000 in April to its close above 7,000 on Tuesday, writes the WSJ's Chelsey Dulaney. Shares of Riot ""surged more than 640 percent during that period, with the bulk of those gains coming after the company switched its focus to investing in blockchain technology October."" Shot: Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, won't run for re-election, according to the NYT. That gives Mitt Romney — former presidential candidate, former Massachusetts governor, former private equity mogul, current (and increasingly frequent) Trump critic — a chance to run for the seat. Chaser: — Michael J. de la Merced Money is cheap, the global economy is gaining momentum and markets are at records. ""Yet things look less reassuring close up,"" writes Quentin Webb of Breakingviews. ""The populist anger that enabled Trump and Brexit is still simmering, fueled by inequality, disruption, immigration and the echo chambers of social media. An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech's overweening power."" With that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews' predictions for 2018: In investing • ""For the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,"" and ""bond vigilantes will rise from the dead."" • ""Passive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive."" In tech • ""In tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life."" • Apple's position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley's power and lack of accountability. — Stephen Grocer We're just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster. From his note yesterday: Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count. It's a big, if logical, assumption given the ever-expanding empire that Amazon has been assembling — one that has put more and more industry incumbents on their back heels. Target shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon. Could Amazon afford Target? Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Yes, but it'd be pretty expensive. Target's market capitalization as of Tuesday morning was nearly $37 billion. Amazon had about $24.3 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, meaning that the company would have to borrow a hefty amount. Assuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion. Amazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn't struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn't stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals. (Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon's market cap. Obviously, I think it's a bit more complicated than that.) The big caveat (other than price) Obviously, it's antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart's 23 percent. But it's hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration's yardstick for market concentration is: • AT&T and Time Warner say that their proposed deal is a vertical deal that falls within the bounds of acceptable deals. The Justice Department has sued to block that. • Disney and Fox have announced a deal that would inevitably lead to lots of layoffs. President Trump has praised that transaction as potentially ""great for jobs."" ""As for antitrust, the Trump administration won't do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,"" Mr. Munster writes. That's a potentially big assumption. — Michael J. de la Merced Kevin McLaughlin of The Information reports that the two companies ""are actively working to replace Oracle software running on critical business systems with open-source database software alternatives, and have made significant progress toward getting off Oracle entirely,"" citing people familiar with the matter. ""A mass exodus from the Oracle database isn't likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives."" Oracle's shares are down nearly 2 percent. They had been trading about 1 percent higher before the report. — Stephen Grocer The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 25 percent in 2017. Does that mean investors should turn bearish on stocks this year? The answer is no if history is any indicator, LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick points out. Also, is the first day of trading predictive of the stock market's performance for the full year? — Stephen Grocer If you couldn't recall last year's highlights over the recent holidays, Andrew can remind you with his annual year-end column (the humor of which is his and his alone). A sample: The seating chart is, of course, always a bit complicated. We had to keep Jeffrey Bezos of Amazon from the dais to prevent Mr. Trump's Twitter war with him from interrupting the festivities. And we had heard that Mr. Bezos had a practical joke planned: He was going to tell Mr. Trump that he had chosen Mexico City as Amazon's second headquarters. But it's a new year, and here are some important story lines we'll be keeping our eyes on: • Now that the tax fight is over, the White House is turning to trade.

And fewer than half of the respondents in the National Association of Manufacturers' most recent survey said they faced an ""unfavorable business climate."" Yet some see a bigger phenomenon at work.

It may have been a brief sales negotiation with Verizon that prompted Rupert Murdoch to consider selling pieces of 21st Century Fox. But the NYT reports that friction between the media mogul and his son James helped push the family toward the Disney transaction. From the article by Brooks Barnes and Sydney Ember: • James Murdoch has privately grumbled about the control that his father still exerted at Fox and has chafed at some of the elements of Fox News's coverage. • Rupert Murdoch was wary of how Hollywood was being reshaped by digital giants like Netflix, Apple and Amazon, and unsure his empire could compete. • Lachlan Murdoch, who is more conservative than his brother, has become the heir apparent at what would remain of Fox, but was initially uneasy about a sell-off. What they gain: Beyond easing family tensions among the trio, the deal could make the Murdochs some of Disney's biggest shareholders. Yes, Ron Baron has lowered fees on some of his smaller funds. But he's unapologetic about charging roughly 54 percent more than the industry average. Here's what he told Landon Thomas Jr. of the NYT: ""Since inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,"" he said in an interview. ""If you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us."" How he (and other mutual funds) do it: Chalk it up to a combination of looser oversight, the $10 trillion of investor money still dedicated to actively managed funds and a lack of investor awareness that high fees don't necessarily pay for performance. Can this go on? One fund investor's take in the NYT: ""I won't say performance warrants the fees they charge,"" said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. ""But I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition."" Bruce Steinberg, an executive at the hedge fund, and his family were among the 12 killed when a single-engine plane crashed in Costa Rica on Sunday.

News,2018-01-02,"HONG KONG — One of the world’s most valuable start-ups got that way by using artificial intelligence to satisfy Chinese internet users’ voracious appetite for news and entertainment. Every day, its smartphone app feeds 120 million people personalized streams of buzzy news stories, videos of dogs frolicking in snow, GIFs of traffic mishaps and listicles such as “The World’s Ugliest Celebrities.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/china-toutiao-censorship.html,1135," HONG KONG — One of the world's most valuable start-ups got that way by using artificial intelligence to satisfy Chinese internet users' voracious appetite for news and entertainment. Every day, its smartphone app feeds 120 million people personalized streams of buzzy news stories, videos of dogs frolicking in snow, GIFs of traffic mishaps and listicles such as ""The World's Ugliest Celebrities."" Now the company is discovering the risks involved, under China's censorship regime, in giving the people exactly what they want. The makers of the popular news app Jinri Toutiao unveiled moves this week to allay rising concerns from the authorities. Last week, the Beijing bureau of China's top internet regulator accused Toutiao of ""spreading pornographic and vulgar information"" and ""causing a negative impact on public opinion online,"" and it ordered that updates to several popular sections of the app be halted for 24 hours. In response, the app's parent company, Beijing Bytedance Technology, took down or temporarily suspended the accounts of more than 1,100 bloggers that it said had been publishing ""low-quality content"" on the app. It also replaced Toutiao's ""Society"" section with a new section called ""New Era,"" which is heavy on state media coverage of government decisions. The change was made, the company said, to ""promote the spirit of the Communist Party congress,"" referring to the gathering of top party leaders that took place in Beijing in October. The episode points to the fine line that Toutiao's creators must walk. Despite China's famously strict censorship, online news is a big business there. More than 610 million people in the country gained access to some news on the internet in 2016, according to official statistics. Toutiao, which says it uses complex algorithms to decide what its users see, combines China's hunger for media content with its rising ambitions in artificial intelligence. Its daily user base of 120 million people is equivalent to more than one-third of the population of the United States. Suan Lin, a 24-year-old private equity analyst in Shanghai, said that she normally has to search high and low online to find articles about the Chinese historical dramas she watches on television. But Toutiao delivers, she said. ""Once you're on it,"" she said, ""you just can't stop."" In China, however, a strong position in media invites scrutiny from the government's censorship apparatus. That scrutiny has become heightened over the past two years as the authorities have looked beyond the political to crack down on news it sees as degrading to society as a whole, which can include things as seemingly unsubversive as celebrity gossip. In Toutiao's case, one of the accounts that were suspended this week had posted a saucy video of a woman in a short skirt. It got 57,000 views. Another suspended account had recently put up a post titled ""The World's Ugliest Celebrities, Michael Jackson Is Ranked First, You Won't Want to Eat After Reading This."" ""Once you have more people watching, then you want to be more cautious,"" Wei-Ying Ma, who heads Toutiao's artificial intelligence lab, told a conference in Beijing last month. As Toutiao's popularity has skyrocketed, Bytedance has become a darling of Silicon Valley investors such as Sequoia Capital. The company, which is currently valued at $20 billion, has been in talks with existing backers to raise new financing that would value the company at more than $30 billion, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are not public. That price tag would make Bytedance among the most valuable privately held technology companies in the world, not just in China. Airbnb is said to be valued at around $30 billion. SpaceX, the rocket maker founded by Elon Musk, is valued at $21 billion. Bytedance has big plans for overseas expansion, too. It recently spent between $800 million and $1 billion to purchase Musical.ly, a video-based social network popular with teenagers in the United States and Europe. At the Beijing conference last month, a top Bytedance executive, Liu Zhen, said the company hoped to be earning half its revenue from outside China within the next five years. Jinri Toutiao, whose name means ""today's headlines"" in Chinese and is pronounced JING-er TOE-tee-yow, aggregates content from various sources and looks much like Facebook's newsfeed. But instead of displaying articles and videos based on what your friends have shared, the app does so based on what you have previously read and watched on the app. If you click on articles about iPhones, then Toutiao will feed you more tech coverage. After you watch a few cooking videos, the app will fetch you more clips of people wrapping dumplings and braising chicken's feet. This approach has helped Toutiao thrive amid China's heavily controlled environment for social media. Instead of policing the sharing activity of tens of millions of users, the company needs only to calibrate and adjust its centralized recommendation software. But it also needs to make sure the app's content does not cross the lines of censors. That is a huge task, particularly given that the overwhelming majority of content on Toutiao is produced by individual bloggers, not professional news organizations or other institutions. Ms. Liu said at last month's conference in Beijing that 90 percent of the app's content comes from blogger accounts. Toutiao has around 1.2 million content-producing accounts in total. According to Bytedance, every piece of content is automatically screened to check that it is acceptable before appearing on Toutiao. But once something has attracted more views, the system applies a more sophisticated screening algorithm. Certain material is also examined by humans as a final check. Bytedance also takes more overt steps to stay on the right side of the authorities. Important updates from the government are sometimes pinned to the top of a user's feed. That can lead to awkward juxtapositions — between, say, a state media write-up on President Xi Jinping's recent decisions and a photo slide show on six women who are ""so beautiful that rich businessmen immediately became attracted to them,"" as the piece's headline puts it. Toutiao has come in for official rebuke before. Last June, the Beijing bureau of the Cyberspace Administration of China ordered around a dozen accounts on the app shut down, calling on Toutiao and other news portals to ""actively promote socialist core values"" and create a ""healthy, uplifting environment for mainstream opinion"" by eschewing dishy coverage of celebrity scandals. In September, the website of the People's Daily newspaper, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, published a series of opinion articles strongly criticizing A.I.-based news apps, including Toutiao, for spreading misinformation and superficial content. Despite Toutiao's popularity, some in China share that view. Yang Sun, a 26-year-old financial analyst in Shanghai, decried the app's sensationalist headlines. ""It should absolutely be taken offline,"" Ms. Yang said. ""Totally deserves it."""
News,2018-01-02,"Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Senate Republican, announced Tuesday that he would retire at the end of the year, rebuffing personal pleas from President Trump to seek an eighth term and paving the way for Mitt Romney, a critic of Mr. Trump’s, to run for the seat.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/us/politics/orrin-hatch-retiring-romney-trump.html,1507," Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Senate Republican, announced Tuesday that he would retire at the end of the year, rebuffing personal pleas from President Trump to seek an eighth term and paving the way for Mitt Romney, a critic of Mr. Trump's, to run for the seat. Mr. Hatch's decision marks another political setback for Mr. Trump, who lost a Senate seat in Alabama after his preferred candidates were rejected. He also faces an exodus of Republicans from both chambers of Congress and has been warned of a political typhoon in November. Mr. Romney's potential ascent is particularly alarming to the White House because the former presidential candidate has an extensive political network and could use the Senate seat as a platform to again seek the nomination. Even if he were not to run again for president, a Senator Romney could prove a pivotal swing vote, impervious to the entreaties of a president he has scorned and able to rally other Trump skeptics in the chamber. ""When there are things he agrees with him on, he'll be a big supporter,"" Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney's longtime fund-raiser, said of Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump. ""And when there are things he disagrees with, he'll voice that."" Mr. Hatch, 83, made his decision public on Tuesday afternoon via a video announcement. ""When the president visited Utah last month, he said I was a fighter. I've always been a fighter. I was an amateur boxer in my youth, and I've brought that fighting spirit with me to Washington,"" he said. ""But every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching."" Mr. Hatch was under heavy pressure from Mr. Trump to seek re-election and block Mr. Romney. Last month, Mr. Trump flew with Mr. Hatch, who has emerged as one of the president's most avid loyalists in the Senate, on Air Force One to Utah for a day of events that was aimed entirely at lobbying the senator to run again. At the request of the senator, the president announced that he was vastly shrinking two of Utah's sprawling national monuments, reversing decisions made by Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. And Mr. Trump used a speech in Salt Lake City to say that he hoped Mr. Hatch would ""continue to serve your state and your country in the Senate for a very long time to come."" Then on Dec. 20, at a White House event celebrating passage of the comprehensive tax cut that Mr. Hatch helped write, the president pulled him aside to again ask him to run. The senator lauded Mr. Trump at the event, calling him ""one heck of a leader."" ""We are going to make this the greatest presidency we have seen, not only in generations, but maybe ever,"" Mr. Hatch said. But the presidential intervention failed. Mr. Hatch decided to retire after discussing the matter with his family over the holidays. That clears the way for the political resurrection of Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee who is now a Utah resident and is popular in the Mormon-heavy state, where he ran the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mr. Romney has told associates he would likely run if Mr. Hatch retires. ""He'd be a very difficult candidate to beat in Utah,"" said Michael O. Leavitt, a former Republican governor of Utah. Mr. Romney repeatedly assailed Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, calling him ""a fraud,"" and Mr. Trump returned the favor, stating that Mr. Romney ""choked like a dog"" in the 2012 race. The two had something of a rapprochement after the election when Mr. Romney was briefly considered as secretary of state, but after Mr. Trump's equivocating statements that followed the racist and anti-Semitic violence in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, Mr. Romney regained his critical voice. ""Whether he intended to or not, what he communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn,"" Mr. Romney wrote of Mr. Trump's statements. ""His apologists strain to explain that he didn't mean what we heard. But what we heard is now the reality."" When it comes to Mr. Trump, Mr. Leavitt said, Mr. Romney has ""not been reluctant to speak his mind, and I can't imagine he would change in the Senate."" In a statement he posted on Facebook on Tuesday, Mr. Romney made no mention of his intentions; he only saluted Mr. Hatch. ""As Chairman of the Senate Finance and Judiciary Committees and as the longest-serving Republican Senator in U.S. history, Senator Hatch has represented the interests of Utah with distinction and honor,"" he said. By Tuesday evening, Mr. Romney had updated his Twitter profile to change his location to Holladay, Utah, from Massachusetts. Mr. Romney intends to make his intentions known in a matter of weeks, according to an adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity. His senior campaign team will include Mr. Zwick; Matt Waldrip, who had been running Mr. Romney's annual policy retreats; and his former chief of staff, Beth Myers. Mr. Zwick did not confirm Mr. Romney would enter the race, but said that ""of all the people who can run, Mitt will represent and honor the legacy of Senator Hatch more than anybody."" Mr. Hatch, who briefly ran for president in 2000, amassed a distinguished record over his four decades in Washington and became a fixture in a Senate once noted for its bipartisanship. While considered an institution in his home state, Mr. Hatch was facing harsh poll numbers in Utah, where 75 percent of voters indicated in a survey last fall that they did not want him to run again. Mr. Hatch's decision comes just weeks after Mr. Trump signed the tax overhaul into law, a measure that the senator helped shepherd as chairman of the Finance Committee. The bill represented something of a capstone to Mr. Hatch's career, and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, even deemed it as such last month in what was seen as a subtle effort to usher his colleague to the exit. Mr. Romney was unaware of Mr. Hatch's decision and of late had been operating under the assumption that the senator would run again, not even bringing up the possibility of a campaign while skiing Monday with friends in Utah. That is in part because Mr. Hatch had privately told Mr. Romney he was not sure he was ready to leave a seat he has held since 1977, and White House officials did all they could to nudge him into another campaign. The president has had Mr. Romney on his mind. Over golf last year, Mr. Trump asked Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, what he thought of the former Republican nominee. (Mr. Graham said he praised Mr. Romney and predicted he would be a solid senator.) As the president prodded Mr. Hatch to stay, voices in his home state were urging him to go. On Christmas Day, The Salt Lake Tribune named the senator ""Utahn of the Year,"" but not for flattering reasons. ""It would be good for Utah if Hatch, having finally caught the Great White Whale of tax reform, were to call it a career. If he doesn't, the voters should end it for him,"" the editorial concluded. In announcing his retirement, Mr. Hatch joined an exodus of Republican heavyweights in what promises to be a difficult election season. Also on Tuesday, Representative Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, disclosed that he planned to retire at the year's end. Mr. Shuster, 56, was facing a possible primary election challenge from the right and said his decision would allow him to focus exclusively on trying to steer major infrastructure legislation, a long-sought bipartisan priority, into law. Other retiring House chairmen include Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, of the Judiciary Committee; Jeb Hensarling of Texas, of the Financial Services Committee; and Lamar Smith of Texas of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology. In all, 29 House Republicans have resigned, announced they will retire or run for another office, compared to 16 Democrats. Mr. Hatch joined Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, both Republicans, in announcing an end to his Senate career. Mr. Hatch defeated a Democrat 42 years ago this November, arguing that the incumbent had stayed in Washington too long, and became one of the country's most prominent senators for a generation. While he usually voted a conservative line, he also developed close relationships with his Democratic colleagues, most famously with Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. In the 1990s, the two collaborated on what became a landmark health care plan, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and Mr. Hatch even wrote a love song for Mr. Kennedy and his wife, Victoria, called ""Souls Along The Way."" ""Orrin's long list of accomplishments means he will depart as one of the most productive members ever to serve in this body,"" Mr. McConnell said in a statement."
News,2018-01-02,"Vice Media placed its president, Andrew Creighton, and its chief digital officer, Mike Germano, on leave after sexual harassment allegations were reported against them in a New York Times investigation that detailed the treatment of women at the company.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/vice-media-executives-on-leave.html,610," Vice Media placed its president, Andrew Creighton, and its chief digital officer, Mike Germano, on leave after sexual harassment allegations were reported against them in a New York Times investigation that detailed the treatment of women at the company. Vice employees learned of the moves in a memo sent to the staff on Tuesday morning. Sarah Broderick, Vice's chief operating officer and chief financial officer, said in the memo that a special committee of the company's board was ""reviewing the facts"" related to a $135,000 settlement Mr. Creighton had reached in 2016 with a former employee, who claimed that she was fired after she rejected an intimate relationship with him, according to people briefed on the matter and documents viewed by The Times. The committee plans to make a recommendation regarding the matter to senior management before the company's Jan. 11 board meeting, and Mr. Creighton will remain out of the office on leave until then, Ms. Broderick said. Ms. Broderick said that the allegations involving the 2016 settlement had been reviewed at the time by an independent law firm, the claim ""was found to lack merit,"" and the company had settled to ""avoid the expense and distraction of litigation."" In an earlier statement to The Times, Mr. Creighton apologized for the situation, said that he and the woman had been ""close friends"" and that they were ""occasionally intimate"" once she had begun working at Vice Media. He said he was not involved in the decision to let her go. Vice also said that Mr. Germano would remain out of the office pending investigations by the company's human resources department and an outside investigator into claims against him. Among the allegations against Mr. Germano are that he told a former employee at a holiday party in 2012 that he had not wanted to hire her because he wanted to have sex with her; and that, in 2014, he had allegedly pulled an employee onto his lap. In an earlier statement, Mr. Germano said he did ""not believe that these allegations reflect the company's culture."" The Times's investigation, published on Dec. 23, found four settlements involving allegations of sexual harassment or defamation against Vice employees, including Mr. Creighton. In addition, more than two dozen women said they had experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct at the company, including unwanted kisses, groping, lewd remarks and propositions for sex. Following the article, a group of workers at Vice UK, the company's British unit, published an open letter calling for an independent investigation, efforts to diversify hiring and the immediate suspension of men who have been named in allegations. ""We stand in solidarity with all the survivors who have come forward,"" the letter read. ""We believe them, and we believe that urgent change is necessary to make our workplace a fairer and safer place for all employees."" On Tuesday, Ms. Broderick outlined a series of initiatives that she said were designed to ""ensure all our employees feel respected and supported."" Those include the hiring of a new head of human resources, mandatory sexual harassment training for all employees and new community efforts, including the creation of affinity groups and mentoring. Ms. Broderick also said that company was ""committed to 50/50 male/female at every level across the organization by 2020 and pay parity by the end of 2018."" Vice got its start in 1994 as a free magazine based in Montreal. Over the years it has grown into a global company with roughly 3,000 employees, a television network, a digital footprint and its own film-production company. It has a documentary program on HBO and counts among its investors the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox."

Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Hulu are on course to increase their spending on new shows and movies at a faster clip than the growth of the overall video-streaming market. Consolidation among traditional media groups is only adding to the frenzy. Something will have to give. Netflix set off the arms race. In 2017, the company, founded by Reed Hastings, directed $6 billion toward licensing and original series like ""Stranger Things."" In 2018, executives plan to earmark up to $8 billion for content, a 33 percent increase. Across the industry, the number of original television shows more than doubled from 2010 to 2016, to 455, according to the research firm MoffettNathanson. Total spending on content by the big four media upstarts in 2018 will mushroom some 30 percent, year over year, to $18 billion, according to a Breakingviews forecast based on analysts' estimates. Yet the entire global video-streaming market is expected to increase 16 percent to about $21 billion, according to PwC. That means there has never been a better time to be a couch potato, but it's glum news for the companies. The tangle of options in streaming services and programming, chasing a finite number of subscribers, suggests the industry is entering an unsustainable investment battle — and a price war may follow as players try to rake in extra market share. Netflix looks like a survivor. It was the first mover in video streaming a decade ago and has 100 million global customers. The snag is that it is burning cash — up to $2.5 billion in 2017. Apple and Amazon could easily outmatch Netflix on content budgets if they decided to abandon financial reason. Amazon, for instance, coughed up $250 million for rights to the ""Lord of the Rings"" TV series, according to a report in Deadline Hollywood. Facebook and Alphabet's YouTube are lurking in the shadows, but that could change. Hulu, with its hydra-headed ownership split among 21st Century Fox, Comcast, Walt Disney and Time Warner, is in a weaker position. Its owners are separately planning their own direct-to-consumer products, adding to the competition. Then there is the possibility of consolidation as media firms bulk up their own content to feed their services. In the latest example, Disney has agreed to buy some of Fox, including its stake in Hulu, for $52 billion. The result is too many characters chasing not enough action."
News,2018-01-02,"MEMPHIS — When one of Martha Jane Pierce’s sons peeled back the white sock that had been covering his 82-year-old mother’s right foot for a month, he discovered rotting flesh.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/nursing-homes-care-corporate.html,2184," MEMPHIS — When one of Martha Jane Pierce's sons peeled back the white sock that had been covering his 82-year-old mother's right foot for a month, he discovered rotting flesh. ""It looked like a piece of black charcoal"" and smelled ""like death,"" her daughter Cindy Hatfield later testified. After Mrs. Pierce, a patient at a nursing home in Memphis, was transferred to a hospital, a surgeon had to amputate much of her leg. One explanation for Mrs. Pierce's lackluster care in 2009, according to financial records and testimony in a lawsuit brought by the Pierce family, is that the nursing home, Allenbrooke Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, appeared to have been severely underfunded at the time, with a $2 million deficit on its books and a scarcity of nurses and aides. ""Sometimes we'd be short of diapers, sheets, linens,"" one nurse testified. That same year, $2.8 million of the facility's $12 million in operating expenses went to a constellation of corporations controlled by two Long Island accountants who, court records show, owned Allenbrooke and 32 other nursing homes. The homes paid the men's other companies to provide physical therapy, management, drugs and other services, from which the owners reaped profits. In what has become an increasingly common business arrangement, owners of nursing homes outsource a wide variety of goods and services to companies in which they have a financial interest or that they control. Nearly three-quarters of nursing homes in the United States — more than 11,000 — have such business dealings, known as related party transactions, according to an analysis of nursing home financial records by Kaiser Health News. Some homes even contract out basic functions like management or rent their own building from a sister corporation, saying it is an efficient way of running their businesses and can help minimize taxes. Contracts with related companies accounted for $11 billion of nursing home spending in 2015 — a tenth of their costs — according to financial disclosures the homes submitted to Medicare. These arrangements offer an additional advantage: Owners can arrange highly favorable contracts in which their nursing homes pay more than they might in a competitive market. Owners then siphon off higher profits, which are not recorded on the nursing home's accounts. The two Long Island men, Donald Denz and Norbert Bennett, and their families' trusts collected distributions totaling $40 million from their chain's $145 million in revenue over eight years — a 28 percent margin, legal documents show. In 2014 alone, Mr. Denz earned $13 million and Mr. Bennett made $12 million, principally from their nursing home companies, according to personal income tax filings. Typical nursing home profits are ""in the 3 to 4 percent range,"" said Bill Ulrich, a nursing home financial consultant. In California, the state auditor is examining related party transactions at another nursing home chain, Brius Healthcare Services, regarding reimbursements from the state's Medicaid program. Rental prices to real estate companies related to the chain of homes were a third higher than rates paid by other for-profit nursing homes in the same counties, according to an analysis by the National Union of Healthcare Workers. Dr. Michael Wasserman, the head of the management company for the Brius nursing homes, called the subject of corporate structures a ""nonissue"" and said, ""What matters at the end of the day is what the care being delivered is about."" Such corporate webs bring owners a legal benefit, too: When a nursing home is sued, injured residents and their families have a much harder time collecting money from the related companies — the ones with the full coffers. Courts set a high bar for plaintiffs to bring these ancillary companies into their cases. After the Pierce family won a rare verdict against the nursing home owners, Mr. Denz and Mr. Bennett appealed, and their lawyer, Craig Conley, said they would not discuss the case or their business while the appeal was pending. ""For more than a decade, Allenbrooke's caregivers have promoted the health, safety and welfare of their residents,"" Mr. Conley wrote in an email. Networks of jointly owned limited liability corporations are fully legal and widely used in other businesses, such as restaurants and retailers. Nonprofit nursing homes sometimes use them as well. Owners can have more control over operations — and better allocate resources — if they own all the companies. In many cases, industry consultants say, a related company will charge a nursing home lower fees than an independent contractor might, leaving the chain with more resources. ""You don't want to pay for someone else to make money off of you,"" Mr. Ulrich, the consultant, said. ""You want to retain that within your organization."" But a Kaiser Health News analysis of inspection and quality records reveals that nursing homes that outsource to related organizations tend to have significant shortcomings: They have fewer nurses and aides per patient, they have higher rates of patient injuries and unsafe practices, and they are the subject of complaints almost twice as often as independent homes. ""Almost every single one of these chains is doing the same thing,"" said Charlene Harrington, a professor emeritus of the School of Nursing at the University of California, San Francisco. ""They're just pulling money away from staffing."" Martha Jane Pierce moved to Allenbrooke in 2008 in the early stages of dementia. According to testimony in the family's lawsuit, when her children visited they often discovered her unwashed, with an uneaten, cold meal sitting beside her bed. Mrs. Hatfield said in court that she had frequently found her mother's bed soaked in urine. The front desk was sometimes vacant, her brother Glenn Pierce testified. ""If you went in on the weekend, you'd be lucky to find one nurse there,"" he said in an interview. After a stroke, Mrs. Pierce became partly paralyzed and nonverbal, but the nursing home did not increase the attention she received, said Carey Acerra, one of Mrs. Pierce's lawyers. When Mrs. Pierce's children visited, they rarely saw aides reposition her in bed every two hours, the standard practice to prevent bedsores. ""Not having enough staffing, we can't — we weren't actually able to go and do that,"" one nurse, Cheryl Gatlin-Andrews, said in a deposition. Kaiser Health News's analysis of inspection, staffing and financial records nationwide found shortcomings at other homes with similar corporate structures: ■ Homes that did business with sister companies employed, on average, 8 percent fewer nurses and aides. ■ As a group, these homes were 9 percent more likely to have hurt residents or put them in immediate jeopardy of harm, and amassed 53 substantiated complaints for every 1,000 beds, compared with 32 per 1,000 beds at independent homes. ■ Homes with related companies were fined 22 percent more often for serious health violations than independent homes, and penalties averaged $24,441 — 7 percent higher. For-profit nursing homes utilize related corporations more frequently than nonprofits do, and have fared worse than independent for-profit homes in fines, complaints and staffing, the analysis found. Their fines averaged $25,345, which was 10 percent higher than fines for independent for-profits, and the homes received 24 percent more substantiated complaints from residents. Overall staffing was 4 percent lower than at independent for-profits. Ernest Tosh, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Texas who helps other lawyers untangle nursing company finances, said owners often exerted control by setting tight budgets that restricted the number of nurses the homes could employ. Meanwhile, ""money is siphoned out to these related parties,"" he said. ""The cash flow gets really obscured through the related party transactions."" The American Health Care Association, which represents nursing homes, disputed any link between related businesses and poor care. ""Our members strive to provide quality care at an affordable cost to every resident,"" the group said in a statement. ""There will always be examples of exceptions, but those few do not represent the majority of our profession."" The model of placing nursing homes and related businesses in separate limited liability corporations and partnerships has gained popularity as the industry has consolidated through purchases by publicly traded companies, private investors and private equity firms. A 2003 article in the Journal of Health Law encouraged owners to separate their nursing home business into detached entities to protect themselves if the government tried to recoup overpayments or if juries levied large negligence judgments. ""Holding the real estate in a separate real-property entity that leases the nursing home to the operating entity protects the assets by making the real estate unavailable for collection by judgment creditors of the operating entity,"" the authors wrote. Such restructuring, they added, was probably not worth it just for ""administrative simplicity."" In 2009, Harvard Medical School researchers found the practice had flourished among nursing homes in Texas, which they studied because of the availability of state data. Owners had also inserted additional corporations between themselves and their nursing homes, with many separated by three layers. To bring related companies into a lawsuit, attorneys must persuade judges that all the companies were essentially acting as one entity and that the nursing home could not make its own decisions. Often that requires getting access to internal company documents and emails. Even harder is holding owners personally responsible for the actions of a corporation — known as ""piercing the corporate veil."" At a conference for executives in the long-term health care industry in Nashville in 2012, a presentation slide from nursing home attorneys titled ""Pros of Complex Corporate Structure"" said, ""Many plaintiffs' attorneys will never conduct corporate structure discovery because it's too expensive and time consuming."" The presentation noted another advantage: ""Financial statement in punitive damages phase shows less income and assets."" A lawyer in Alabama, Barry Walker, is still fighting an 11-year-old case against another nursing home then owned by Mr. Denz and Mr. Bennett. Mr. Walker traced the ownership of Fairfield Nursing and Rehabilitation Center back to the men, but he said the judge had allowed him to introduce the information only after the Alabama Supreme Court ordered the judge to do so. That trial ended with a hung jury, and Mr. Walker said a subsequent judge had not let him present all the information to two other juries, and he dropped the men from the lawsuit. The home closed a few years ago but the case is still ongoing, after two mistrials. ""The former trial judge and the current trial judge quite frankly don't seem to understand piercing the corporate veil,"" he said. ""My firm invested more in the case than we can ever hope to recover. Sometimes it's a matter of principle."" The complexity of the ownership in Mrs. Pierce's case was a major reason it took six years to get to a trial, said Ken Connor, one of the lawyers for her family. ""It requires a lot of digging to unearth what's really going on,"" he said. ""Most lawyers can't afford to do that."" The research paid off in a rare result: In 2016, the jury issued a $30 million verdict for negligence, of which Mr. Denz and Mr. Bennett were personally liable for $20 million. The men's own tax returns had bolstered the case against them. They claimed during trial they delegated daily responsibilities for residents to the home's administrators, but they reported on their tax returns that they ""actively"" participated in the management. The jury did not find the nursing home responsible for her death later in 2009. The appeal brought by Mr. Denz and Mr. Bennett challenges both the verdict and their inclusion. They argue that Tennessee courts should not have jurisdiction over them since they spent little time in the state and neither was involved in the daily operations of the home or in setting staffing levels. Their lawyers said jurors should never have heard from nurses who hadn't cared directly for Mrs. Pierce. ""No way did I oversee resident care issues,"" Mr. Bennett said in a deposition. Whoever was responsible for Mrs. Pierce's care, her family had no doubt it had been inadequate. Her son Bill Pierce was so horrified when he finally saw the wound on his mother's foot, he immediately insisted that she go to the hospital. Mrs. Hatfield said the surgeon had told the family that ""he had never seen anything like it."" ""He amputated 60 percent of the leg, above the knee,"" she said. After the amputation, Mrs. Pierce returned to the nursing home because her family did not want to separate her from her husband, who was also there. At the trial, the nursing home's lawyers argued that Mrs. Pierce's leg had deteriorated not because of the infection but because her blood vessels had become damaged from a decline in circulation. The jury was unpersuaded after nurses and aides testified about how Allenbrooke would add staffing for state inspections while the rest of the time their pleas for more support went unheeded. Workers also testified that supervisors had told them to fill in blanks in medical records regardless of accuracy. One example: Allenbrooke's records indicated that Mrs. Pierce had eaten a full meal the day after she died."

You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. China is suspending the production of more than 500 car models and model versions that do not meet its fuel economy standards, several automakers confirmed Tuesday, the latest move by Beijing to reduce emissions in the world's largest auto market and take the lead in battling climate change. The government-affiliated China Vehicle Technology Service Center said that the suspension, effective Jan. 1, would affect both domestic carmakers and foreign joint ventures. The move was expected to affect a small share of car manufacturing in China, where 28 million vehicles were produced in 2016. China has dozens of small-scale automakers — some producing just a few hundred cars a year — and the central government has tried to consolidate its auto industry, a factor that most likely also played a role in the suspension. Model versions — for example, different combinations of an engine and transmission — are constantly being deregistered. Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, said that the ban would affect at most 1 percent of the Chinese market. But the government's decision to cite fuel economy in the deregistration of so many versions at the same time is nonetheless a signal of the government's commitment to fuel economy. The country, which for years prioritized economic growth over environmental protection and now produces more than a quarter of the world's human-caused greenhouse gases, has emerged as an unlikely bastion of climate action after President Trump's rejection of the Paris climate agreement. Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to rein in dangerous air pollution, a hot-button issue in China, where thick smog has at times forced schools and businesses to temporarily shut down. Late last month, China said it was going ahead with plans to create the world's largest carbon market, giving Chinese power companies a financial incentive to operate more cleanly. ""They're sending a signal to everybody — that this is for real,"" said Michael Dunne, president of Dunne Automotive, a Hong Kong-based consultancy on China's clean car market. ""This shows their emissions standards have teeth."" The Chinese government has already become the world's biggest supporter of electric cars, offering automakers numerous incentives for producing so-called new energy vehicles. Those incentives are set to decrease by 2020, to be replaced by quotas for the number of clean cars automakers must sell. That has spurred global automakers to pick up the pace in their shift toward battery-powered cars. By contrast, the United States is considering relaxing tailpipe emissions standards and very nearly killed off a tax credit for electric vehicles during its latest tax overhaul. The fact that Chinese automakers like the state-run giant Dongfeng Motor Corporation did not appear to be spared ""shows that the government is not playing favorites in trying to meet their goals,"" said Bruce M. Belzowski, managing director of the Automotive Futures group at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. The Chinese government had long held back from aggressive emissions standards to allow its own automakers to catch up with the latest clean car technology. But that is changing, with the government setting increasingly stringent tailpipe rules. The latest development ""is a testimony to how quickly their own automakers have evolved,"" Mr. Dunne said. ""They're saying: We're ready to play this game."" Foreign automakers were still tallying the effect of the suspension on Tuesday. Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda and other foreign automakers in China referred queries on specific numbers to their Asia offices. Rebecca Kiehne of BMW, which runs the BMW Brilliance joint venture in China, said the company was not yet prepared to comment. We know. Global warming is daunting. So here's a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. Han Tjan, a spokesman for Daimler, said production would not be affected at its Beijing Benz joint venture with the Chinese car manufacturer BAIC Motor Corporation. The only car covered by the suspension was a high-end E-Class model the venture has not manufactured since 2016, he said. The United States regulates cars by model years, and also approves various versions of each model. Each version may no longer be sold in the new car market if it was built to meet a previous model year's regulations and the regulations are different for the new model year. By contrast, China relies on a system of assigning a number to each version of a model. When an automaker tweaks a car's design to improve its appeal or improve its regulatory compliance, whether annually or at some other interval, the new version receives a new number. China deregistered 553 of these numbers effective Dec. 31. Global automakers will have no choice but to meet the increasingly stringent government policies in China, said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at the AutoTrader Group. ""The simple fact that China is the biggest market means automakers will be accommodating,"" she said."
News,2018-01-02,"At Wright State University in Ohio, the French horn and tuba professors are out. So is the accomplished swimming team.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/us/international-enrollment-drop.html,1263," At Wright State University in Ohio, the French horn and tuba professors are out. So is the accomplished swimming team. At Kansas State, Italian classes are going the way of the Roman Empire. And at the University of Central Missouri, The Muleskinner, the biweekly campus newspaper, is publishing online-only this year, saving $35,000 in printing costs. Just as many universities believed that the financial wreckage left by the 2008 recession was behind them, campuses across the country have been forced to make new rounds of cuts, this time brought on, in large part, by a loss of international students. Schools in the Midwest have been particularly hard hit — many of them non-flagship public universities that had come to rely heavily on tuition from foreign students, who generally pay more than in-state students. The downturn follows a decade of explosive growth in foreign student enrollment, which now tops 1 million at United States colleges and educational training programs, and supplies $39 billion in revenue. International enrollment began to flatten in 2016, partly because of changing conditions abroad and the increasing lure of schools in Canada, Australia and other English-speaking countries. And since President Trump was elected, college administrators say, his rhetoric and more restrictive views on immigration have made the United States even less attractive to international students. The Trump administration is more closely scrutinizing visa applications, indefinitely banning travel from some countries and making it harder for foreign students to remain in the United States after graduation. While government officials describe these as necessary national security measures, a number of American colleges have been casualties of the policies. ""As you lose those students, then the tuition revenue is negatively impacted as well,"" said Michael Godard, the interim provost at the University of Central Missouri, where 944 international students were enrolled in the fall, a decline of more than 1,500 from the previous year. ""We've had to make some decisions, budgetary decisions, to adjust."" International students pay double the $6,445 tuition of Missouri residents, and the lost revenue amounts to $14 million, according to Roger Best, the chief operating officer for the school, in Warrensburg, Mo. Dr. Best said that the university has been forced to cut instructors in computer programs, where many of the foreign students were enrolled, as well as defer maintenance and shave money from other departments, such as the campus newspaper. Nationwide, the number of new foreign students declined an average of 7 percent this past fall, according to preliminary figures from a survey of 500 colleges by the Institute of International Education. Nearly half of the campuses surveyed reported declines. Now that the revenue stream appears to be diminishing, the financial outlook may be dire enough to weigh down the bond ratings of some schools, making it more expensive for them to borrow money, according to Moody's Investors Service. Last month, Moody's changed its credit outlook for higher education to ""negative"" from ""stable."" ""Growing uncertainty for international student enrollment stems from immigration policies that are in flux,"" Moody's said, warning that universities without global brand recognition would be hit hardest. While some flagship public and elite private colleges have been affected, the Institute of International Education said, the biggest impact will be felt by second-tier institutions. The shift comes just as some states also are experiencing a drop in domestic students, partly the result of a decline in birthrates two decades ago. This year, the number of domestic undergraduate students dropped 224,000, or 1 percent, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. An increasingly diverse population in that age group means that more of the students come from low-income families in which no one has ever gone to college, also presenting recruitment challenges for universities, according to Doug Shapiro, the organization's executive research director. ""Affordability issues are the biggest hurdles,"" Mr. Shapiro said. ""There's only so much you can do with recruiting if the families can't afford the tuition."" Officials at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kan., reported an overall enrollment decline of more than 900 students, including 159 fewer international students. One official cited a ""perfect demographic storm."" Budget cuts are underway. Faced with a demand from the university that it trim its budget, faculty in the school's modern languages department picked Italian as the language to cut, a decision that will save the university the salary of its only Italian professor, which one faculty member said was about $47,000. A final decision is still pending. ""This definitely undermines that idea of diversity many U.S. universities proclaim to promote across the country,"" said Alessia Salamina, the professor whose job is in jeopardy. ""This is in fact a national emergency, not only a K-State one."" According to the institute's survey, enrollment is falling from a broad range of countries, including China and India, the two biggest sources of students. Among countries covered by Mr. Trump's travel ban, Iran is the largest, though it can still send students to the United States. But many administrators believe the president's views on immigration have made applying to United States colleges more of a gamble today. Officials said that other reasons for the decline in enrollment include increased competition from schools in other countries, cuts in scholarship programs in Saudi Arabia and Brazil, and a currency crisis in India caused when the government decided to swap widely used notes for new bills. For years, American colleges had been staking their futures on continued growth in foreign students, and after the recession a decade ago, those students were a lifeline for colleges that had poured money into new buildings and amenities. In just the past six months, the University of Akron opened an international center in an existing building and hired 10 employees to work in international programming. The president, Matthew Wilson, said that students from India were reporting increased scrutiny of their visa applications, one of the reasons for a drop of about 200 international students. Even a marketing campaign featuring Akron's favorite son, LeBron James, who is wildly popular in China, hasn't been enough to stave off declines. But Mr. Wilson said he remained optimistic. ""International isn't something where I'm thinking this is going to result in budgetary cutbacks,"" he said. ""Some folks are scaling back. We're actually scaling up."" Akron is one of several public universities in Ohio reporting drops in enrollment, including of international students. At Wright State, near Dayton, the cuts have been deep and broad. Moody's has already downgraded Wright State three notches, citing among other factors a notable drop in international enrollment, nearly 800 students over two years. Wright State has decided to eliminate Italian, Russian and Japanese, part of more than $30 million in budget cuts. The swimming team will cease to exist this spring, even after five of its members recently competed at the U.S.A. Winter Nationals. The team's elimination prompted at least two members to decide to leave the university, according to Trevor Keriazes, who specializes in the breaststroke. Other cuts included the full-time French horn and tuba professors, both one year short of tenure protection. The school had asked both to remain as adjunct professors with reduced pay. Instead, they landed other jobs, and adjuncts have taken their positions at Wright State. ""It was a contentious thing for a lot of people,"" said Jonas F. Thoms, who had developed a vibrant French horn studio at Wright State, and recently joined West Virginia University. The trumpet and trombone still have full-time professors, but with the loss of the horn and tuba jobs, Mr. Thoms said, ""they cut half of the brass faculty."""
News,2018-01-02,"WASHINGTON — United States officials have effectively killed a Chinese company’s $1.2 billion plan to buy MoneyGram, the money transfer company, signaling the Trump administration’s growing skepticism of Chinese purchases of American companies and of broader business ties between the two economic powers.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/moneygram-ant-financial-china-cfius.html,1112," WASHINGTON — United States officials have effectively killed a Chinese company's $1.2 billion plan to buy MoneyGram, the money transfer company, signaling the Trump administration's growing skepticism of Chinese purchases of American companies and of broader business ties between the two economic powers. MoneyGram and Ant Financial, the Chinese electronic payments company, said Tuesday that they had canceled the deal after failing to win approval from a Washington panel that reviews foreign purchases of American companies. The move comes amid a shifting relationship between the two countries. The MoneyGram-Ant Financial deal collapsed as tensions have grown over who will control the technologies of the future. As the scotched deal shows, China and America are also increasingly at loggerheads over whether private data will be kept safe as money and corporate ownership cross borders. ""The geopolitical environment has changed considerably since we first announced the proposed transaction with Ant Financial nearly a year ago,"" the chief executive of MoneyGram, Alex Holmes, said. The deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet tycoon who controls Ant Financial. Shortly after Mr. Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs. That push apparently could not compete with Mr. Trump's concerns about Chinese money and deal makers, and with his administration's concerns about Chinese acquisitions of American know-how. The administration is finishing an investigation into Chinese theft of intellectual property owned by American companies, which could result in tariffs on Chinese imports or further restrictions on Chinese investment. At a daily news conference on Wednesday, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said that the government hopes the United States could create a level playing field for Chinese companies. The Trump administration could soon take other steps to stop what it considers unfair Chinese trade practices in China in areas like solar panels. For now, the collapse of the MoneyGram deal could spell trouble for other Chinese companies considering major acquisitions. The effort by Ant Financial, the payments affiliate of the internet giant Alibaba, was seen as a test of the Trump administration's political and regulatory approach to China. Other deals under review include the sale of SkyBridge Capital — an investment firm founded by Anthony Scaramucci, an ally of Mr. Trump — to an arm of HNA Group, a Chinese conglomerate. The collapse of the deal offers the latest sign of a shift — one that began during the end of the Obama administration — over how Washington treats Chinese acquisitions of American assets. Mr. Trump and other politicians have long criticized Chinese trade practices and their impact on traditional, heavy industries in the United States, such as steel. But officials and lawmakers of both parties have grown increasingly concerned with Chinese purchases in high-tech areas, like semiconductors and artificial intelligence. China — a country that has grown by leaps and bounds in expertise in recent years — has aggressively funded development of next-generation technology in ways that have alarmed some foreign governments and businesses. That has led to calls to tighten reviews of Chinese purchases of American assets. Chinese investment surged to more than $130 billion in 2017 from just $21.5 billion in 2012, according to Rhodium Group, a research firm. In 2018, bankers say they expect another big year of investment, targeted more at sectors considered important to future economic growth like high technology and renewable energy. Lawmakers from both parties have introduced legislation calling for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in the United States. They are pushing for an expansion of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, the multiagency panel that reviews foreign deals for potential threats to national security and that rejected the MoneyGram-Ant Financial plan. In 2016, American concerns over China's interest in microchips scotched some Chinese purchases, and last year Mr. Trump blocked the purchase of Lattice Semiconductors by a group with links to China. The deal's demise also illustrates rising concerns in both the United States and China over sensitive personal data. In buying a large-scale money-transfer company like MoneyGram, Ant Financial would have had access to a large number of records of financial flows within the United States. That fact, combined with close ties to China's government, could have created security problems. For example, the flow of funds could point to possible espionage targets in the United States military who face financial difficulties. Ant Financial has disputed such claims, saying that consumer data would continue to be stored in the United States. ""This deal fell apart because Ant Financial is from China, a country that has little credibility when it comes to protecting personal data,"" said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Add to that the lack of reciprocity — China would never countenance such a deal in reverse — and one could ask why Alibaba would expect to find a sympathetic hearing in Washington."" Critics of the deal also asked whether Ant Financial would be able to properly police transactions linked to money laundering or terrorism. Ant Financial had said the deal would give MoneyGram greater resources to toughen its efforts to prevent money laundering. China, as well, has taken steps to stanch American company access to data. A new cybersecurity law there forces American companies to keep data on Chinese citizens stored within China, while Chinese state-media have run public service announcements warning about private data collected by Apple's iPhones. ""Data flows out of and into China are an increasing source of suspicion in the bilateral relationship,"" said Adam Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. He said Washington was in the ""paradoxical position"" of criticizing the new Chinese law while opposing deals like MoneyGram because of national security concerns. For Ant Financial, the decision is a setback to its efforts to extend its strong position in online payments abroad. Ant Financial, which grew out of the Chinese payment service Alipay, wanted to buy MoneyGram to accelerate its global expansion. In the past several years, the company has pushed into India, South Korea and Thailand. Mr. Ma, the Chinese internet tycoon, has worked hard to put a positive face on his companies in the United States. He also controls the Alibaba Group, China's largest internet company, and last year he hosted a conference in Detroit aimed at helping American businesses sell on Alibaba's e-commerce sites. Amid the heightened sensitivity to overseas purchases, MoneyGram and Ant Financial said it was clear that Cfius would not approve the deal, despite their efforts to quell concerns."

The committee chairman, Sam Ervin, a Democrat, said that would be ""as foolish as the man who went bear hunting and stopped to chase rabbits."" Today, amid a growing criminal inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, congressional Republicans are again chasing rabbits. We know because we're their favorite quarry. In the year since the publication of the so-called Steele dossier — the collection of intelligence reports we commissioned about Donald Trump's ties to Russia — the president has repeatedly attacked us on Twitter. His allies in Congress have dug through our bank records and sought to tarnish our firm to punish us for highlighting his links to Russia. Conservative news outlets and even our former employer, The Wall Street Journal, have spun a succession of mendacious conspiracy theories about our motives and backers. We are happy to correct the record. In fact, we already have. Three congressional committees have heard over 21 hours of testimony from our firm, Fusion GPS. In those sessions, we toppled the far right's conspiracy theories and explained how The Washington Free Beacon and the Clinton campaign — the Republican and Democratic funders of our Trump research — separately came to hire us in the first place. We walked investigators through our yearlong effort to decipher Mr. Trump's complex business past, of which the Steele dossier is but one chapter. And we handed over our relevant bank records — while drawing the line at a fishing expedition for the records of companies we work for that have nothing to do with the Trump case. Republicans have refused to release full transcripts of our firm's testimony, even as they selectively leak details to media outlets on the far right. It's time to share what our company told investigators. We don't believe the Steele dossier was the trigger for the F.B.I.'s investigation into Russian meddling. As we told the Senate Judiciary Committee in August, our sources said the dossier was taken so seriously because it corroborated reports the bureau had received from other sources, including one inside the Trump camp. The intelligence committees have known for months that credible allegations of collusion between the Trump camp and Russia were pouring in from independent sources during the campaign. Yet lawmakers in the thrall of the president continue to wage a cynical campaign to portray us as the unwitting victims of Kremlin disinformation. We suggested investigators look into the bank records of Deutsche Bank and others that were funding Mr. Trump's businesses. Congress appears uninterested in that tip: Reportedly, ours are the only bank records the House Intelligence Committee has subpoenaed. We told Congress that from Manhattan to Sunny Isles Beach, Fla., and from Toronto to Panama, we found widespread evidence that Mr. Trump and his organization had worked with a wide array of dubious Russians in arrangements that often raised questions about money laundering. Likewise, those deals don't seem to interest Congress. We explained how, from our past journalistic work in Europe, we were deeply familiar with the political operative Paul Manafort's coziness with Moscow and his financial ties to Russian oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin. Finally, we debunked the biggest canard being pushed by the president's men — the notion that we somehow knew of the June 9, 2016, meeting in Trump Tower between some Russians and the Trump brain trust. We first learned of that meeting from news reports last year — and the committees know it. They also know that these Russians were unaware of the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele's work for us and were not sources for his reports. Yes, we hired Mr. Steele, a highly respected Russia expert. But we did so without informing him whom we were working for and gave him no specific marching orders beyond this basic question: Why did Mr. Trump repeatedly seek to do deals in a notoriously corrupt police state that most serious investors shun? What came back shocked us. Mr. Steele's sources in Russia (who were not paid) reported on an extensive — and now confirmed — effort by the Kremlin to help elect Mr. Trump president. Mr. Steele saw this as a crime in progress and decided he needed to report it to the F.B.I. We did not discuss that decision with our clients, or anyone else. Instead, we deferred to Mr. Steele, a trusted friend and intelligence professional with a long history of working with law enforcement. We did not speak to the F.B.I. and haven't since. After the election, Mr. Steele decided to share his intelligence with Senator John McCain via an emissary. We helped him do that. The goal was to alert the United States national security community to an attack on our country by a hostile foreign power. We did not, however, share the dossier with BuzzFeed, which to our dismay published it last January. We're extremely proud of our work to highlight Mr. Trump's Russia ties. To have done so is our right under the First Amendment. It is time to stop chasing rabbits. The public still has much to learn about a man with the most troubling business past of any United States president. Congress should release transcripts of our firm's testimony, so that the American people can learn the truth about our work and most important, what happened to our democracy."

Andrew M. Cuomo in November just grew exponentially more daunting, with Harry Wilson's decision this week to forgo his bid — leaving party strategists downcast, frustrated and scrambling. Mr. Wilson, a businessman who unsuccessfully ran for state comptroller in 2010, was widely seen as the Republicans' top recruit, and he had seriously looked at the governor's race for months. He registered the site www.wilsonforgovernor.com in May 2017. He told Republican officials that he would invest $10 million of his own fortune into his campaign. He repeatedly pinged New York and national strategists about his pathway, including traveling to gatherings like the Republican Governors Association. But he officially pulled the plug in a New Year's Day Facebook post, citing his commitment to his family. ""Everyone was really hoping for Harry Wilson,"" said Andrea Catsimatidis, the chairwoman of the Manhattan Republican Party. ""We thought he would be great."" Now New York Republicans are headed into the midterm elections, saddled by a president who is deeply unpopular in this heavily Democratic state and without a clear leader of their own for the top of the ticket. Whoever does run faces the financial might of Mr. Cuomo, who had banked more than $25 million for his run as of mid-2017 and is expected to report having millions of dollars more in the coming weeks. ""Because Harry was able to come to the table with his own personal financial commitment, we all kind of held in place wondering whether he'd get in or out,"" said Marcus Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, who is also considering a Republican bid for governor. Just to match Mr. Cuomo's treasury from six months ago, any Republican would need to raise more than $550,000 every week between now and November. In a dozen interviews, Republican operatives and officials expressed a fresh urgency at their predicament. The state's Republican congressional delegation is in the cross hairs of national Democrats hoping to win back the House, especially following the passage of a new tax law that punishes high-tax states like New York. And the party's current lone foothold on power in Albany, their control of the State Senate bolstered by fragile alliances with renegade Democrats, is also imperiled this fall. Over sodas and sandwiches, more than a dozen of New York's top Republican political strategists gathered last month, convened by Ms. Catsimatidis, to plot a path back for the party. On a whiteboard, they brainstormed together a list of ideal characteristics for a statewide Republican candidate, among them: resources (i.e. having money or the ability to raise vast sums), being a woman, being a political outsider, speaking Spanish and having a political base in downstate New York. The problem? The current crop of Republicans check off almost none of those boxes. So far, the only declared candidate is Brian Kolb, the Republican minority leader in the Assembly who represents a district near Rochester. Besides Mr. Molinaro, John DeFrancisco, the No. 2 Republican in the State Senate from near Syracuse, is also mulling a run, as is the former Erie County executive Joel Giambra, who since became a lobbyist and endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016. In addition to the messaging challenge of ousting a two-term governor for a political insider, Mr. Cuomo has proved adept at locking up campaign cash from institutional Albany, the same donors those challengers would likely have to rely upon. ""You can't take the fight to Albany if you're from Albany,"" said one of the Republican operatives who attended, who spoke anonymously to not disparage the eventual nominee because so many of the current candidates are linked to Albany. Some have urged Chele Chiavacci Farley, a finance chairwoman for the New York Republican Party, to challenge Mr. Cuomo. Ms. Farley is currently laying the groundwork to run against Senator Kirsten Gillibrand this year, and has begun assembling a campaign team, including John Brabender, a former adviser to the presidential candidate Rick Santorum, and the pollster John McLaughlin. But Ms. Farley has told people she is set on a Senate bid. ""It's clear that hard-working taxpayers are fed up with Kirsten Gillibrand's obstruction, political grandstanding, and ineffectiveness,"" she said in a statement. ""In the next few weeks, I will be making an official announcement about my intentions."" Republican county party leaders are set to gather in Albany on Monday to plot their next steps; two days later, in Manhattan, the same strategists that met last month are scheduled to reconvene. For now, the Republican political strategy seems to be mostly hoping that Mr. Cuomo, riding high in polls, self-destructs: that the transit woes of New York City's subways worsen; that the upcoming corruption trial of one of his former top aides, Joseph Percoco, tarnishes his image; that the state budget falls out of whack; that Democrats challenge and wound him from the left in a primary; and that the third term curse proves an actual curse. Geoff Berman, the executive director of the New York Democratic Party, rattled off Mr. Cuomo's accomplishments, including gun control, infrastructure investment and managing the budget for Mr. Cuomo's strong position. ""That's a hard record to run against, and these would-be candidates know it,"" Mr. Berman said. ""New Yorkers aren't stupid. They know a good thing when they see one and are not going to be fooled by the empty rhetoric of extreme conservatives, no matter how well-funded or rich they may be."" Ed Cox, the chairman of the New York Republican Party, said the governor's race would be an ""anybody but Cuomo"" campaign, just like the one that felled Mr. Cuomo's father, the former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, in 1994. Except now Republicans are expected to battle Trump headwinds; in 1994, they were riding an anti-Clinton wave. ""The Bills are in the playoffs for the first time in 17 years, so I always remain hopeful that we can win statewide,"" said Andrea Bozek, a Buffalo-based Republican strategist who previously ran communications for House Republican campaigns nationally. But in New York, she said, Republicans are inured to a weak top of the ticket.""It's just a benefit that we haven't enjoyed,"" she said. ""It would be awesome, but …"" Her voice trailed off, and she didn't finish the sentence."
News,2018-01-03,"My mother is in her mid-50s, which is the time at which people can develop frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), a form of dementia she is at risk for. Symptoms of FTD include a lack of inhibition or social tact and unusual verbal, physical or sexual behavior. My father and I have at times worried that she may be exhibiting the beginnings of other symptoms. A few years ago, she consulted with a doctor, but no diagnosis was made.

Symptoms of FTD include a lack of inhibition or social tact and unusual verbal, physical or sexual behavior. My father and I have at times worried that she may be exhibiting the beginnings of other symptoms. A few years ago, she consulted with a doctor, but no diagnosis was made. I think it is pertinent to note that there is currently no cure for FTD. She has been married to my father for almost 30 years. They raised me and my two brothers, though we no longer live with them. I recently found out that my mother has been seeking sexual relations through various online platforms, and I am fairly certain that her efforts have come to fruition. I think it is fair to say that these relations have come to be because of a ""lack of inhibition""; in addition, I believe that these sexual relations have included things that, for her, would have previously been considered ""unusual sexual behavior."" When I initially came upon the discovery of her extramarital affairs, I was unsure what to do. I thought that it would make the most sense to discuss this with her, in the hope that she would curb her behavior, which I think could eliminate the need to inform my family. If, however, this is a sign that she is developing FTD, I feel that it is pertinent for my family to know of the situation. If I bring this up with my family and it turns out not to be related to the development of FTD, it could cause irreparable harm to her relationship with my father and my brothers. If I choose to discuss this with only her and she is later diagnosed with FTD, I worry that the disease might have been diagnosed sooner if this behavior had come to light; yet, if there is no cure for FTD, it may not matter all that much when it is diagnosed. I say this, however, with one caveat: My mother is the one who manages both of my parents' finances. When my grandmother was diagnosed with FTD, my mother and aunt took control of her finances. My mother also noted that perhaps the FTD explained a few strange financial decisions that my grandmother had taken in the years before her diagnosis. If, in fact, my mother is developing FTD, it could pose a risk to my parents' finances and thus both of their lives after my father's retirement. So while an earlier diagnosis of FTD would not lead to a greater probability of recovery (as there is none), it may prevent her having a negative influence on my parents' finances. I am at a loss of what to do in this situation, as it seems that one choice would almost certainly have a negative impact on my parents' and my family's lives, while the other could negatively impact my parents' financial security. Name Withheld FTD is one of those conditions that can be definitively diagnosed only posthumously. But a clinical diagnosis can be made with neuropsychological tests, supported by neuroimaging. The most common type of the disease chiefly presents itself (at least in the early phases) through behavioral changes; another type announces itself with difficulties in using and understanding language. The main ways you're likely to find out that your mother has the condition is if her judgment becomes increasingly impaired and if personality changes and other deficits become obvious. As you're aware, no available treatments can cure the disease or slow its progression, though it's possible to manage some of the symptoms. So if she is developing FTD, facing the truth here will be difficult for all of you. It will be especially difficult for her, not least because FTD patients don't always recognize that they're ill. Your pressing task is to persuade your mother — ideally accompanied by you or your father — to see a specialist. Given that your father is already concerned about her, you should be able to enlist him in his task without getting into upsetting details about her sex life. Either way, if her behavioral changes worsen, you should talk to your father and prepare him to take over their finances and (more important) to begin to face her decline. It is in the nature of family relations that children are morally free and may be morally required to share worries about the state of one parent with the other. If she indeed has FTD, her disinhibition is likely to show up eventually in forms of eccentric behavior that can no longer be ignored. My sister is in her 80s and lives alone in a rented apartment in a Canadian city where she moved nearly 60 years ago. Her formerly strong network of friends and acquaintances is dissolving as they age, sicken and die or lose the energy and patience to deal with her. In my opinion, she has a hoarding disorder and the beginnings of dementia, and she has had problems maintaining her apartment to the landlord's satisfaction. She also has trouble dealing with documents, paying bills and scammers. She never became a Canadian citizen, and her Canadian and American identification have both expired so she can no longer travel. I am in my 70s and live hundreds of miles away in the United States. I have a husband, an adult child and grandchildren, for whom I provide a lot of child care. My sister is behind my other family in my priorities, and frankly she drives my husband and me crazy. I am not willing to relocate to Canada or have her live with my husband and me. She has refused to give me power of attorney so that I can deal with financial institutions when she has been scammed or has neglected to pay bills. For some time, she refused to admit that she has any ""memory problems"" or to consult her doctor. She does not want anyone messing around in her business. I see her a few days each year, during which I try to touch base with the last of her friends, do some cleaning and decluttering, have some fun with her and yes, nag her to make some changes. If she continues to refuse help, may I be excused from feeling guilty? Name Withheld Being excused by me isn't likely to stop you from feeling guilty. You seem to have done all that you could reasonably be expected to do at this point. The trouble is that your sister is likely to cross the border into incompetence, where the balance shifts as to what your relationship demands. For now, you must respect her autonomy; once she reaches a certain stage, caring for her may involve ignoring her expressed wishes. Early-onset dementia, a concern faced by our previous writer, poses one set of complications. But dementia among the elderly poses a broad social burden simply because it's so common. By 2030, all the baby boomers will be 65 or older. Last year, in Canada, the number of seniors (ages 65 or older) for the first time exceeded the number of children (14 or younger). If your sister's dementia advances, as is likely, and if she has the resources to be cared for in a residential facility (or to receive in-home care), you might want to hire a lawyer in Canada to help you manage her affairs and establish her legal identity. If your sister received permanent residency in Canada, there are procedures for replacing an expired permanent-resident card. If she's in Canada against the law, you'll want a copy of her U.S. birth certificate, because Canada will have the right to send her back to the United States. Once she regularizes her documents, the authorities might let her back in, but if she was in a condition in which she needed frequent attention, it might be better if she were near you. The laws governing who can get certified copies of birth certificates vary by state. But as a sibling, you will generally be in a better position than a stranger. With the certificate in hand, you would be able to present it to United States consular officials in Canada in order to get her settled in a home in the United States. If she doesn't have the necessary savings, she could be eligible for Medicaid as a citizen. I've gone into the weeds a little bit to make the point that taking over when your sister can't care for herself would be a major commitment. But no one else is in a position to do this, and as her sibling, you do owe her what philosophers call ""special obligations."" Some people would like to think that such special obligations are binding only if they are voluntary. That's not the case. Your sister, ornery as she may be, has someone she can expect to help her when she can't help herself any longer. And that person, I'm afraid, is you."

""The effect it is to have on the city of New York is something larger than any mind can realize,"" said William Gaynor, the New York mayor who set in motion the primary phase of its construction. A public-works project of this scale had never before been undertaken in the United States, and even now, more than a century later, it is hard to fully appreciate what it did for the city and, really, the nation. Before the subway, it was by no means a foregone conclusion that New York would become the greatest city on earth. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants fleeing poverty and persecution were arriving on its doorstep every year, but most of them were effectively marooned, herded into dark, squalid tenements in disease-ridden slums. The five boroughs had recently been joined as one city, but the farms and villages of Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens might as well have been on the other side of the planet from Manhattan's teeming streets. Bound up in the fate of the city were even larger questions: Would America be able to manage the transition from the individualism and insularity that defined its 19th-century frontiers to the creative collaboration and competition of its fast-growing urban centers? Could it adapt and excel in this rapidly changing world? Were cities the past or the future of civilization? And then came the subway: hundreds of miles of track shooting out in every direction, carrying millions of immigrants out of the ghettos and into newly built homes, tying together the modern city and enabling it to become a place where anything was possible. It was the arrival of the subway that transformed a seedy neighborhood called Longacre Square into Times Square, that helped turn a single square mile surrounding the Wall Street station into the center of global finance, that made Coney Island an amusement park for the masses. It was the subway that fueled the astonishing economic growth that built the city's iconic skyscrapers. Other cities had subways, but none threaded through nearly as many neighborhoods as New York's, enabling it to move large numbers of workers between Manhattan and the middle-class boroughs — a cycle that repeated itself every day, generating ever more wealth and drawing in ever more people. As New York evolved over the decades, the subway was the one constant, the very thing that made it possible to repurpose 19th-century factories and warehouses as offices or condominiums, or to reimagine a two-mile spit of land between Manhattan and Queens that once housed a smallpox hospital as a high-tech university hub. When the city is in crisis — financial or emotional — the subway is always a crucial part of the solution. The subway led the city's recovery from the fiscal calamity of the 1970s. The subway was at the center of the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks. The subway got New York back to work after the most devastating storm in the city's history just five years ago. The questions we are facing today are not so different from the ones our predecessors faced 100 years ago. Can the gap between rich and poor be closed, or is it destined to continue to widen? Can we put the future needs of a city and a nation above the narrow, present-day interests of a few? Can we use a portion of the monumental sums of wealth that we are generating to invest in an inclusive and competitive future? The answer to all of these questions is still rumbling beneath New York City. For all the changes in transportation technology since the first tunnels were dug — the rise of the automobile, the proliferation of bike lanes and ferries, our growing addiction to ride-hailing apps and dreams of a future filled with autonomous vehicles — the subway remains the only way to move large numbers of people around the city. Today, New York's subway carries close to six million people every day, more than twice the entire population of Chicago. The subway may no longer be a technological marvel, but it continues to perform a daily magic trick: It brings people together, but it also spreads people out. It is this paradox — these constant expansions and contractions, like a beating heart — that keep the human capital flowing and the city growing. New York's subway has no zones and no hours of operation. It connects rich and poor neighborhoods alike. The subway has never been segregated. It is always open, and the fare is always the same no matter how far you need to go. In New York, movement — anywhere, anytime — is a right. Most countries treat subway systems as national assets. They understand that their cities are their great wealth creators and equality enablers and that cities don't work without subways. The public-private corporation that runs Hong Kong's subway expects 99.9 percent of its trains to run on time, and they do. (If you are traveling to the airport, you can also check your luggage at a central downtown train station and not see it again until you've landed at your destination. Imagine!) China has been feverishly building new metro systems in cities across the country, a recognition that subways are the only way to keep pace with the nation's rapid urbanization and the needs of its citizens. And it's not just new cities that are seeing major investments in their subways. Two decades ago, the decline of London's Underground became a national crisis; now it's moving toward running driverless trains. For that matter, Los Angeles — Los Angeles — recently embarked on a 40-year, $120 billion project to build out its mass-transit system. New York City's subway, meanwhile, is falling apart. If you are a regular rider, you know this firsthand. But even if you aren't, it has probably become difficult to ignore all the stories about the system's failure: the F train that was trapped between stations for close to an hour without power or air conditioning, the Q train that derailed in Brooklyn, the track fire on the A line in Harlem that sent nine passengers to the hospital. The cumulative impression of all these miserable underground experiences — and all these stories about miserable underground experiences — is that the situation is hopeless, that the subway cannot be fixed. The subway has been wrecked, and in this era of short-term thinking and government mistrust, public-works projects with benefits larger than any single mind can realize are no longer possible. But it is possible to fix the subway. And we must. Our failure to do so would be a collective and historic act of self-destruction. I. WHO WRECKED THE SUBWAY? The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the government agency that operates the subway, uses the catchall word ""incident"" to describe all the various events that impede the system's healthy functioning. Every one of these incidents triggers an investigation resulting in an incident report, a minute-by-minute account of what went wrong and the steps taken to resolve the issue. Thousands of these reports are produced every month. A random sampling of incidents from a single recent day include: ""Signal Trouble,"" ""Switch Trouble,"" ""Unruly Person(s),"" ""Track Circuit Failure,"" ""Delayed by Track/Work Gangs,"" ""Water Condition,"" ""Fire/Smoke Conditions,"" ""Debris on Roadbed,"" ""Brakes Fail to Charge"" and ""Sparks Issuing."" Among the most common were ""Excess Dwell Time"" and ""Insufficient Capacity/Crowding."" Translation: too many passengers, not enough trains. All these problems lead to one really big problem: The trains are terminally late, obstructed daily by a cascade of system failures. During the first three months of 2017, three-quarters of the subway's lines were chronically behind schedule. The worst offender, the 2 train, was late nearly 70 percent of the time. For a delayed rider wondering whom to blame, it's tempting to begin with the people you can see, the 7,000 or so men and women — track cleaners, inspectors, flaggers and other orange-vested M.T.A. employees — charged with preventing these incidents and keeping the trains moving. On a steamy morning in August, I sat among a small group of them in a dingy, defunct public elementary school in Gravesend, Brooklyn, that serves as the M.T.A.'s Transit Learning Center. Taped to the classroom wall were yellowing tabloid clips of a different kind of subway horror story — ""MAN UNDER!, RAIL HORROR: HIT THIRD TRACK AND LIVED!"" — a tableau that lent the one-day safety course, a requirement for all M.T.A. employees and contractors, some of the flavor of those grisly low-budget driver's-ed videos designed to scare teenagers straight. ""If you should do something silly today, like get hit by a train, you cannot sue New York City Transit,"" my instructor, Jim Fortin, said as he distributed release forms to the class. It's a common occurrence: A passenger is killed on the tracks pretty much every week. The course would end with a walk on a live track. If I survived the day, I would receive a laminated license qualifying me to work in the tunnels of the New York City subway system — ""in the hole,"" as it is known. Fortin walked us through the potential hazards that awaited us. He taught us the proper arm motions to use if we ever found ourselves needing to signal to an oncoming train to stop. After a short multiple-choice test and a break for lunch, we were issued orange vests, flashlights, helmets and safety goggles. Our group walked to a nearby N station, rode a few stops, transferred to the R and got off at 53rd Street, where we walked to the end of the platform and climbed down a ladder onto the tracks. Fortin soon directed us to what he called ""clear-up spots,"" small, shallow openings built into the walls of the narrow tunnels that we had been taught that morning to identify. A train was coming. I stuffed my flashlight into my back pocket and tucked myself into the tiny space, remembering Fortin's instructions: ""Get in. Get centered. Don't move."" I could hear the train approaching and see its headlight out of the corner of my eye. In about 30 seconds a string of 45-ton steel cars was thundering by, just 18 inches from my frozen body. It was terrifying, but also thrilling, like the entire industrial revolution was speeding past my face. At point-blank range, subway cars seem invincible. In fact, they can be laid low by something as insignificant as a broken bolt or a can of soda — which, when resting against the third rail, might heat up and ignite a scrap of newspaper, causing a track fire, the source of hundreds of delays every month. Every inch of the system's rails is supposed to be checked twice a week for imperfections. Much of this work happens overnight, when the frequency of trains on this 24-hour system decreases and workers are able to move more freely on the tracks. ""While the rest of the city is sleeping, there's a whole industrial ballet going on underground that most people have no idea about,"" John Samuelsen, a track inspector who now runs the Transport Workers Union of America, told me. ""It's like friggin' Brigadoon down there."" And yet a recent study found that only 3 percent of the tracks in stations meet the M.T.A.'s own standards for cleanliness. Workers face an even more insidious challenge than trash in the form of water. Many parts of the system are below the water table, and its lines course through neighborhoods that were once lush farmland. On a dry day, the M.T.A. pumps 13 million gallons of water from the system. Over time, the water corrodes the system, rusting and rotting its infrastructure — and yet sealing and grouting these leaks often requires rerouting service on lines, further frustrating riders. Next year, the L train will begin a shutdown that will last at least 15 months for repairs to its East River tunnel, which flooded during Hurricane Sandy. Some 225,000 people will have to find a new way to get in and out of Manhattan every day. No matter how diligent they may be, 7,000-odd orange-vested maintenance workers are simply not enough to keep the deteriorating system — with its 665 miles of passenger-carrying track, enough to reach all the way to Indianapolis — on schedule. All the real problems must begin elsewhere, further up the chain of command. Pretty much every decision that destroys your commute happens not below ground but above it, in an unmarked building on the West Side of Manhattan called the Rail Control Center. Here, men and women sit at computer consoles behind large wall-mounted schematic track and station displays in a high-ceilinged, windowless command space, directing the changes — moving a local train to an express track, taking a train out of service — that determine the daily transportation fate of thousands, sometimes millions, of passengers. When I visited the facility several months ago, I was greeted by the official who oversees all these disruptions, Barry Greenblatt. A tall, slender man in a gray suit with two Bic pens in his shirt pocket and a silver tie clip so tarnished that you barely make out the letters on it — ""M.T.A."" — Greenblatt is the authority's vice president and chief officer for service delivery, Department of Subways. It's his job to run the trains. Greenblatt, a 31-year veteran of the M.T.A., grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, without a car. ""I started riding trains and buses by myself pretty much from the time I was 5 years old,"" he told me after we settled into a conference room overlooking the command center. He became a bus driver when he graduated from college, fulfilling a childhood dream, and has been an employee of the M.T.A. ever since, gradually moving up the ladder to his current position. ""We operate the trains,"" he said. ""We try to run them on time — 5.66 million average daily riders, 1.7 billion annual riders. Right now, there are 585 trains out there. We will run 8,477 one-way trips over the course of a day. We hope to have 8,477 on-time trains. We're not going to do it today."" Greenblatt's morning began with a 2:30 a.m. phone call: An operator moving a train out of storage at a yard in East New York, Brooklyn, had driven through a stop signal, damaging the switch beneath him. ""The first question we would ask is whether it is going to have any impact on service,"" Greenblatt said. A few hours later, at 5:10 a.m., he received a text message about another incident: A passenger had called from the Park Place station, near City Hall, to report that there was smoke on the tracks. Seven minutes later, the New York City Police Department reported via an internal-communications line known as ""the 6 Wire"" that a transformer may have exploded in the station. Greenblatt managed the response. Service on the 2 and 3 lines was rerouted, and several teams were deployed to Park Place to figure out what was going on. They soon discovered that a chunk of metal, about 18 inches long, had fallen onto the tracks, breaking through the third-rail protection board and shorting out the power. ""If you bridge the third rail, which has 600 volts of electricity, to the signal rail, which has 12 volts of electricity,"" Greenblatt said, ""it's going to blow things."" The Rail Control Center's chief officer, Paul McPhee, showed me a picture on his phone of the charred board, which looked as though it could have been pulled from the fire pit at a campsite. It took about two and a half hours for the temporary repairs to be completed and full power to be restored. The trains could now start running again but were required to move at reduced speeds in the vicinity of the station. ""We're operating in a degraded mode right now,"" Greenblatt said. Systemwide, the biggest source of subway delays is simple overcrowding. In the 1990s, after a derailment killed five passengers and a collision killed a train operator, the M.T.A. started actively slowing down its trains. This has reduced ""throughput"" — the number of trains that move through the system at any given time — which has increased crowding. And when the subway becomes more crowded, it grows slower still, with trains stuck in stations while knots of passengers fight their way in and out of cars. As ridership grew from 2012 to 2016, the end-to-end running time during peak hours on the numbered lines increased by more than six minutes. Average train speeds are now slower than they were in 1950. The subway could be both faster and safer if all of it were controlled by a computer-based signal system, which would automatically ensure that trains are always operating at the maximum safe speed, with the narrowest possible distance between them. Instead, much of the subway uses a signal system that dates to the 1920s and '30s. What that means didn't really hit home for me until I visited the signal-repair shop at the 215th Street rail yard in Manhattan. Technicians were hunched over cast-iron gadgets — stop motors, compressors, track relays — that looked as if they belonged in the workshop of an eccentric antique collector. In the machine shop downstairs, I saw workers making mounting brackets and ball bearings; even the system's most basic parts are so obsolete that they have to be manufactured in-house. ""A lot of the equipment we really can't purchase,"" the M.T.A.'s assistant chief of signals, Salvatore Ambrosino, told me as we watched a technician assemble a tiny motor. ""Our only option is to rebuild."" What would rebuilding the subway actually look like? Replacing the signal system is just one in a long list of needs, some of which were recently compiled by the Regional Plan Association, a civic group that has been studying New York infrastructure for decades. Most of the system's 472 stations need some kind of major repair or wholesale renovation. Elevators need to be added — fewer than one in five stations are even partially accessible to people with physical disabilities. Cracked tiles and rusty columns need to be replaced. Stairwells and entryways need to be enlarged, flood-prone openings need to be waterproofed, ventilation plants need to be rebuilt. All the platforms need to be sealed off from the tracks with automatic sliding doors to prevent passengers from throwing trash on the rail bed and block them from falling, jumping or being pushed under a train. Sharp turns in tunnels throughout the system need to be reconstructed so that they are less severe, allowing for higher speeds and thus more trains. The Regional Plan Association stopped there, but you could go further. The roadbed beneath much of the track needs to be chipped out and replaced with fresh concrete and new drains. About 3,000 of the system's 6,400 cars date to the 1960s, '70s and '80s. About half of those need to be rebuilt with modern motors, wheels and brakes, as well as open gangways between the cars to increase capacity. The other half need to be replaced altogether. In the meantime, Greenblatt and his staff take it day by day, managing incidents as though they are an inevitable force of nature. When I asked him about the so-called F-train meltdown that became a media sensation in June — hundreds of passengers were stuck in a tunnel for more than 40 minutes in a 40-year-old train that lost power — he told me he was surprised the incident received so much attention. When he left work that night, it had not felt any different from any other day on the job. And in a sense, it wasn't. The F-train meltdown was just one of the 8,122 incidents reported during the month of June. ""I don't know if I like the word 'meltdown' so much,"" Greenblatt said. ""Things happen."" It is Gov. Andrew Cuomo who, by a strange quirk of New York history, is ultimately responsible for the subway. As governor, he appoints the chairman of the M.T.A. — a sprawling government bureaucracy with 70,000-plus employees overseeing nine bridges and tunnels, two commuter railroads, the New York City bus system and the subway — as well as a plurality of its directors. More to the point, he effectively controls the state budget that funds the authority. It was Cuomo who pressed the M.T.A. to complete its endlessly delayed construction on the first phase of the Second Avenue subway — three new stations; two new miles of track — before the end of 2016 and who presided over its opening in January 2017 like a proud parent. In the months that followed, though, the subway's many underlying problems burst open like a broken water main, and angry riders made a point of affixing the hashtag #CuomosMTA to their proliferating complaints on social media. After initially trying to shift the blame to the city's mayor, Bill de Blasio, Cuomo has of late been trying to recast himself as the subway's can-do savior. He convened an advisory panel, called FixNYC, to study the idea of implementing a congestion-pricing plan to help subsidize mass transit. He created an open competition called the Genius Challenge: Come up with a viable plan to fix the subway and win $1 million. And on a rainy, wind-swept night in early September, his press office invited a small group of reporters and local camera crews to assemble in a soggy, grime-caked ventilation room beneath the Union Square station to watch him roll out his latest plan. Spotlights hung from rusty columns; a dozen or so chairs were arrayed before a lectern and a video monitor. A little before midnight, Cuomo made his dramatic entrance through a large vented manhole, climbing down a metal ladder in pressed chinos, tasseled boots and a windbreaker bearing the New York State seal, and announced that he was doubling the fine for littering in the subway to $100 and buying some new jumbo-size vacuum cleaners to clean the tracks. The moves were part of Cuomo's $836 million ""NYC Subway Action Plan,"" which was unveiled last summer by the newly installed M.T.A. chairman, Joe Lhota, who had also run the authority several years earlier. The matter of who is going to cover that $836 million remains a matter of some controversy. Cuomo offered to pay for half and said the city should cover the rest. De Blasio refused, noting that the city had already given the M.T.A., which it did not control, billions of dollars in taxes. The plan remains only partially funded. This is a familiar quandary for the subway. When the M.T.A. first took control of the system in 1968, the idea was to use toll money from bridges and tunnels to subsidize the subway, but this scheme supplied only a small part of what was needed. For years, the state and federal governments picked up the shortfall, but beginning in the 1990s, Gov. George Pataki and the Republican-controlled Congress refused to cover the M.T.A.'s rising costs. It has been scrambling for new streams of income ever since. Cuomo, for all his homilies about American greatness being the product of ""what we built,"" has also rejected some efforts to add new revenue sources to the subway. In 2015, a state assemblyman from Brooklyn, Jim Brennan, wrote a bill that would have steered a small but escalating percentage of state personal-income tax to the authority. Cuomo's staff dismissed the idea. ""They said the M.T.A. wouldn't be able to spend the money, the construction industry was already at capacity,"" Brennan told me. ""Of course, when I would talk to Tom Prendergast"" — the chairman of the M.T.A. at the time — ""and his top people, they would go: 'Yes, yes, we can spend the money! Give us the money!' "" In fact, the M.T.A. has often proved all too capable of spending money, with construction costs well beyond what other cities spend on similar projects. It's fair to blame the whole New York political establishment — Cuomo, de Blasio and their counterparts stretching back decades — for presiding over the subway's decline. But the real political problem is, at root, a structural one. The subway subsists on an ad hoc patchwork of taxes implemented and overseen by a governor who represents millions of voters well beyond the greater metropolitan area. Brennan estimates that New York City is responsible for 55 percent of the state's revenues, but that doesn't change a fundamental political reality for its governors: People who don't ride the subway don't want to pay for the subway. You might say the subway is a victim of the same rural-urban divide that has come to define American politics today. A more parochial version of this divide exists in the city itself, where representatives of car-centric outer-borough neighborhoods continue to fight congestion-pricing plans that could deliver hundreds of millions of dollars every year to the M.T.A. How much money does the subway really need? The Regional Plan Association has done some preliminary estimates based on the current cost of M.T.A. projects. They calculated that renovating the 30 stations most desperately in need would run $14 billion. Dealing with those sharp turns to increase speeds and capacity would cost $5 billion. Adding 61 track miles with new stations — mainly in neighborhoods without subway access and with large and generally low-income populations that are heavily dependent on mass transit — would run another $62 billion. Replacing the signal system would cost $27 billion. The group didn't look at replacing or overhauling cars, but a recent M.T.A. contract priced them at about $2 million each, so buying all of the new cars that are needed would cost nearly $3 billion. Just this partial list — I haven't included the platform doors, for instance — brings the total to about $111 billion. It's a big number. But not when you put it in context. New York City and its environs generated $1.7 trillion in gross metropolitan product in 2016. That's roughly 9 percent of the nation's overall G.D.P. How much of that activity is dependent on the subway? About a year before Hurricane Sandy, a state-funded group of scientists and engineers produced a comprehensive (and as it happens, prescient) report on the damage that a hundred-year storm surge could cause to the system. One of the study's authors, Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist at Columbia University, told me that losing the subway for a month would cost the city about $60 billion in lost economic output. The reality of this apocalyptic scenario hasn't sunk in. Absent sufficient resources, the subway has been left with diminished ambitions and empty spectacles. Inside the ventilation room at Union Square, Cuomo delivered some remarks about the scourge of garbage in the subway and then led the group out onto the waterlogged tracks. A few industrial-strength vacuum cleaners stood waiting. The governor posed for a picture with a Starbucks cup he had picked up off the rail bed and then took a turn on the hose of the 83-horsepower Vac-Tron, sucking up watery gunk that would no doubt be back with the next heavy rain. II. WHY WE MUST SAVE THE SUBWAY The subway has been saved before, and the man who saved it was Richard Ravitch. Stocky, white-haired and gruff, Ravitch, now 84, is the type of civic macher you don't see much anymore, an urban idealist who has spent his career moving back and forth between the public and private sectors. His grandfather fled the pogroms in Russia, and — classic New York story — created a successful construction business from nothing. He lost everything in the Depression, and then his son, Ravitch's father, made his name building apartment buildings on Central Park West. Ravitch followed his father into the real estate business. In the 1960s, he served on President Lyndon Johnson's National Commission on Urban Problems, and in 1973, after 12 years of trying, he completed Waterside, a $78 million, 1,470-unit development for low-and-middle-income families on the East River, just south of the United Nations. A couple of years later, Ravitch played a critical role in rescuing New York City from its fiscal crisis, helping to persuade the teachers' union to invest $150 million of its pension fund in a new series of city bonds. And in 1979, he was named chairman of the M.T.A. Ravitch didn't need the job or even really want it. He waived his salary and took to wearing a bulletproof vest in public after someone threatening to kill him shot an M.T.A. police officer at his office. But he was a child of the New Deal and a passionate believer in the subway, which at the time was in even worse shape than it is today. During the fiscal crisis, drastic funding cuts had spun the subway into a downward spiral of deteriorating tracks, malfunctioning cars, increasing crime and falling ridership, a steep decline that tracked the city's own postindustrial collapse. To reverse the trend, Ravitch prepared a detailed breakdown of the costs of repairing and replacing all of the system's outdated equipment and proposed a sweeping plan to help fund the work. He argued at the time: ""The transit situation, though lacking the drama of imminent bankruptcy, represents an equally grave threat to our economy, the social equilibrium and the survival of the greatest city in the world."" The subway's importance to the city begins with a single, durable economic principle: Cities create density, and density creates growth. Economists call the phenomenon agglomeration. Not only does geographical proximity reduce costs, but it also facilitates the exchange of knowledge and spurs innovation. It's a principle that holds true for better and worse and regardless of the industry. The free-market economist Edward Glaeser has pointed out that the junk bonds and leveraged buyouts of '70s and '80s Wall Street were as much the product of human collaboration as they were of corporate greed. The urban-planning professor Elizabeth Currid-Halkett coined the phrase ""the Warhol economy"" to describe how this same sort of cross-fertilization and idea-sharing works in New York's art, fashion and music worlds. As industries grow, they attract and create new, connected ones: Book publishers beget book agents, tech start-ups beget venture-capital firms and so on. It all begins with the ability to pack large numbers of people into small spaces and then unpack them at the end of the day. Without the subway, this process breaks down, and the city dissipates. Ravitch took his case to editorial boards and legislative leaders. But there was a problem. No one wanted new taxes. So Ravitch cold-called David Rockefeller, the longtime head of Chase Manhattan Bank. ""I said, 'Mr. Rockefeller, this is an audacious request, but would you get up at 5 in the morning and let me show you the subway system?' "" he told me one afternoon in his office at Waterside. ""And he said yes."" Ravitch then suggested that Rockefeller bring along the chairman of MetLife and the president of AT&T. All three went and saw the dirty, graffiti-scarred system firsthand. As Ravitch tells the story, that was all it took: Rockefeller called the majority leader of the State Senate and told him to ""give Ravitch what he needs."" The tax package passed, and Ravitch ultimately raised $7.7 billion — more than $17 billion in today's dollars — much of which was spent replacing cars, refurbishing stations and increasing maintenance. The turnaround was not immediate. A year after Ravitch's tax plan was enacted, annual subway ridership dropped below one billion. But before long, as the system gradually became safer, more reliable and less unsavory, it started to trend up. By 2015, ridership had hit 1.7 billion, a level not seen since the late 1940s. The rejuvenation of the subway has been intertwined with a protracted period of staggering economic prosperity — agglomeration at work. New York rebuilt the subway, and the subway rebuilt the city. It was one of the great urban renaissance stories of our modern era. But now that the city is thriving, it faces another challenge, perhaps an even greater one: how to spread this staggering wealth more evenly. The subway might again be a central part of the solution. If the story of the subway is the story of density, it is also the story of land — and more to the point, the story of land value. Before the first tracks had even been laid, real estate speculators were gobbling up farmland and empty lots along the proposed route and then quickly flipping their parcels at huge premiums to builders. When the subway recovered from its last major crisis, it again began throwing off enormous returns for the owners of the land above it. From 1993 to 2013, the average price for a co-op or condo in TriBeCa rose from $182 per square foot to $1,569. In the process, prime real estate in Manhattan was transformed from a place where people lived and built businesses into a high-yield investment in which absentee owners parked their money and watched it grow. As Manhattan's business-district centers became denser and its scarce real estate more expensive, the growth started to spill out, following the subway's snaking lines across the river, into Brooklyn and Queens. ""Developers build things where the subway works, and we build far fewer things where it doesn't,"" Jed Walentas, the 43-year-old principal of the real estate development company Two Trees Management, told me recently over lunch at a cafe in Dumbo, Brooklyn's answer to SoHo. ""We put density where there's transit."" Walentas, who was wearing the familiar Brooklyn uniform of jeans, New Balance sneakers and a blue hoodie, and his father, David, own a good chunk of Dumbo, an investment that has made them rich — house in the Hamptons, vacations heli-skiing — beyond the wildest dreams of most New Yorkers. I've known Walentas since the early 2000s, when I rented a desk in one of his many buildings in the neighborhood, a turn-of-the-century factory that has since been converted into multimillion-dollar condominiums. This is pretty representative of Dumbo's overall trajectory over the last two decades. It's a stark transformation that would have been impossible to predict when his father first started buying up the neighborhood's underutilized properties in the early 1980s, before it was widely known as Dumbo. What enabled it to happen wasn't just the neighborhood's excellent subway access — it's sandwiched between the F line and the A line — or the city's economic recovery, or even the exodus of rich people priced out of Manhattan by even richer people. The transformation of Dumbo required something much simpler: a change in the zoning law. For years, the neighborhood had been restricted to only manufacturing uses, a legacy of the city's losing battle to retain industrial jobs in the 1960s. In the late '90s, Walentas and his father were able to persuade the city to jettison these old rules and allow them to completely remake the neighborhood, filling old factories with loft apartments, design-and-tech-centric offices, retail stores, artists' studios and new condo towers. In the subsequent 20 years, as the neighborhood changed, average condo prices rose from $200 per square foot to more than $1,500. More recently, Walentas has pushed north into Williamsburg, leveraging similar rezonings there to turn a former textile factory into the trendy Wythe Hotel (near the L train) and a 19th-century Domino sugar refinery (J, M and Z) into three million square feet of office space, retail stores, parks and apartments. Like most good-government tools, zoning sounds boring, but it is in fact a secret means by which cities are shaped and fortunes are made. If the subway delivers density, zoning determines where that density goes by doing things like placing limits on how tall buildings can rise or how many dwellings they can contain. New York's zoning codes are byzantine, the product of years of pushing and pulling between the desire to allow the city to evolve and grow and the impulse to keep development in check. These codes have helped preserve the city's historic buildings and neighborhoods while preventing its streets from being forever cast into darkness by endless rows of skyscrapers. But they have also had the effect of restricting the supply of housing, which has driven up prices, especially in neighborhoods with desirable buildings and good subway access. ""I rent studio apartments for $3,400 a month,"" Walentas told me. ""It doesn't make any sense."" New York is facing an affordable-housing crisis. In response, the city is incentivizing developers to build below-market-rate housing with property-tax exemptions, while also adding regulations that require them to incorporate more affordable housing into their higher-end projects. But securing one of these affordable units is not easy. Of the roughly 2,300 apartments in Walentas's Domino project, about 700 will be reserved for lower-income tenants. The first 105 affordable units were recently made available at monthly rents ranging from $590 to $964; 87,000 people entered the lottery for them. Walentas is a developer. If you want housing to be more affordable, he says, build more houses. ""The way to put downward pressure on rents is not to have fear of making things better,"" he told me. ""It's to make things so pervasively better that people have more choices."" In his words, it's ""insane"" that so little of the wealth that the subway generates flows back into the system. In Hong Kong, the company that runs the subway also controls the property around it, earning huge amounts that it can then reinvest in service enhancements. The M.T.A., by contrast, is largely cut out of the land profiteering that it enables: Of the authority's roughly $16 billion budget in 2017, about $460 million came from a tax on residential real estate transactions. An additional $520 million came from a tax on commercial sales. To put those numbers in perspective, several years ago, a group of economists calculated that the land in New York City — just the land, not the buildings on it — was worth about $2.5 trillion. One thing New York City has plenty of is money, and much of it is bound up in real estate, a kind of blank canvas with unlimited economic promise. Toward the end of our lunch, I asked Walentas a hypothetical question: What if the M.T.A. could offer the real estate community development rights as a kind of bargaining chip? Would it underwrite subway upgrades and expansions into underserved areas in exchange? ""Oh, yeah,"" he said without hesitating. ""It's just math. You can make the money come right out of the air with a pencil."" The subway has made a lot of people very rich. And without carefully constructed zoning laws that foster inclusive growth, it can create the kind of gentrification that contributes to America's growing income divide. That divide has been especially acute in New York City. The Fiscal Policy Institute, an economic think tank, reports that between 1980 and 2015, the share of the country's income going to the wealthiest 1 percent increased from 10 percent to 22 percent. In New York City, it went from 12.2 percent to 40.9 percent. The subway can help narrow that divide by doing what subways do best: increasing density. For all the recent growth in neighborhoods like Dumbo and Williamsburg, large pockets of the city remain underpopulated and underdeveloped. Many of these neighborhoods already have good subway access. One of them is in a section of Brooklyn called East New York. East New York is predominantly black and Hispanic, with a small South Asian community. Its median household income is about $35,000, and some 35 percent of its 35,000 or so residents live below the federal poverty level. East New York was gradually hollowed out by the same cycle of disinvestment that ate away at a lot of formerly middle-class neighborhoods in New York and other American cities over the course of the 1960s and '70s. The city's manufacturing jobs had disappeared, and the white middle-class flight from the neighborhood was underway, helped along by avaricious real estate brokers who issued alarmist warnings about East New York's future. In the process, East New York became a victim of what economists call spatial, or geographic, inequality: As its population shrank and its demographics changed, stores closed and city services declined, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. And so for the most part it remained, until recently, when the gentrification that had been pushing east across Brooklyn along the L train began to creep into East New York. A neighborhood that had long been starved of resources was now in danger of being hit by a wave of development that could push out longtime residents. What was to be done? The answer will be a kind of grand experiment in urban planning, made possible, of course, by the subway. East New York was recently rezoned to invite both residential and commercial development to revive the neighborhood, but with a combination of regulations and incentives that will ensure that half of the nearly 6,000 units of new housing would be affordable. This time, as the subway draws new residents to a neighborhood, the city will take a stronger hand in shaping its demographics and trying to ensure that its existing population isn't priced out. The hope is that the whole neighborhood will become more dense, and the resulting prosperity will be widely shared. All with just the stroke of a pencil and the subway. The concept dates to Mayor Michael Bloomberg's era, when the Obama administration awarded New York a grant for cities looking to build more affordable housing near mass transit. De Blasio has now turned it into an early cornerstone of his promise to build or preserve 300,000 affordable apartments around the city. In addition to the subsidies it will provide to developers, the city has pledged to contribute $250 million to building schools, parks and a new community center in the neighborhood. ""This sort of targeted investment has never been done before in any community,"" the local City Council member, Rafael Espinal, told me as we toured the neighborhood on a recent afternoon. Espinal, the son of Dominican immigrants, grew up in the adjoining neighborhood of Cypress Hills and was an important advocate for the rezoning, over the objections of some who argued that the increased development would only accelerate gentrification in East New York. ""If we didn't move forward with this plan, the reality is that people here would have been displaced,"" he said as we passed the construction site for one of the neighborhood's first new developments, Chestnut Commons. It's a mixed-used development built around an apartment complex with 274 units of affordable housing; more than 80 units will be set aside for households earning up to $25,770, some of them specifically reserved for formerly homeless families. We ended up back at the Broadway Junction subway station, the inspiration for the rezoning plan and the home to five different lines and a stop on the Long Island Rail Road. Broadway Junction is dark, dingy and overcrowded. Some 100,000 people pass through this station every day, and yet the blocks surrounding it are largely barren. The rezoning plan envisions a rebuilt Broadway Junction as the commercial anchor for the whole project. It takes some imagination, but if you squint hard enough, you can see it: a brightly lit, newly renovated transit hub, providing the density needed for retail stores, office space and government and academic institutions, bringing new economic energy to the neighborhood and — while we're imagining things — a much better subway for the people who live in East New York. The revitalized blocks around Broadway Junction — desirable to people with more money, affordable to people with less — would reduce spatial inequality and provide current residents new jobs. And with a faster, more reliable subway, those same residents could also commute more quickly not just to Manhattan but to hospitals, nursing homes, health care clinics and community colleges in the outer boroughs, the source of a lot of the city's more recent job growth. In New York, transit dictates opportunities. The case for the subway is the case for mobility: physical mobility, economic mobility, social mobility. The business leaders, politicians and engineers who made the subway all those years ago understood that promise, and it remains the most profound message of the system even in its decline: The city can be built, and the people can come, and they can thrive — millions of them, then millions more. That revelation has sustained us for more than a century, and some among us still see within our broken subway the stubborn glimmers of genius. When Max Diamond was a preschooler in Park Slope in the late 1990s, he turned his wooden train set into an exact replica of his local line, complete with all four tracks and the accurate location of each switch. By the time he was 8, he could identify and describe in detail all the different types of cars in the subway system. By the time he was 11, he knew the track layout of the entire system, not just the different stops on the different lines, but the hundreds of places where the tracks connect and the precise locations of the multitude of switches and signals. In the eighth grade, he started his own YouTube channel, where his subway videos, which he posts under the handle Dj Hammers, made him something of a celebrity among subway buffs. In 2016, Diamond was hired by the M.T.A. as a paid intern, and at 21, he now crunches numbers in its performance-analysis unit while he works toward an economics degree at the City College of New York. We met one fall afternoon at the Fulton Street station in Manhattan, just a short walk from the M.T.A.'s headquarters, and boarded a Brooklyn-bound J train — an R42, he said, dating to 1969. We got on the first car, moving quickly to the large picture window at the front of the train, as has been Diamond's custom since he was a toddler, and wended our way through the tunnels beneath Lower Manhattan before emerging into the fading sunlight on the elevated tracks across the Williamsburg Bridge. Like most regular riders, I tend to think of the subway as a necessary evil, the least worst way to get where I'm going, which made it a little disorienting to spend time with someone who rides the subway for fun. But in its early years, hundreds of thousands of people did just that every Sunday. According to the historian Clifton Hood, it was called ""doing the subway."" Diamond calls it ""railfanning."" The subway is a very different sort of marvel today. What's miraculous at this point is that it still works at all. The fact that it does, that even after decades of neglect it is still somehow managing to carry New York's economy on its back, may be the best argument for giving it everything it needs, and then a whole lot more. And what is the alternative? Here's one possible scenario: New York won't die, but it will become a different place. It will happen slowly, almost imperceptibly, for years, obscured by the prosperity of the segment of the population that can consistently avoid mass transit. But gradually, an unpleasant and unreliable subway will have a cascading effect on New Yorkers' relationship with their city. Increasingly, we will retreat; the infinite possibilities of New York will shrink as the distances between neighborhoods seem to grow. In time, businesses will choose to move elsewhere, to cities where public transit is better and housing is cheaper. This will depress real estate values, which will make housing more affordable in the short term. But it will also slow growth and development, which will curtail job prospects and deplete New York's tax base, limiting its ability to provide for citizens who rely on its public institutions for opportunity. The gap between rich and poor will widen. As the city's density dissipates, so too will its economic energy. Innovation will happen elsewhere. New York City will be just some city. That doesn't have to happen. The subway still exists, and the people who operate it still bring a kind of subtle genius to their work. As we rode deeper into Brooklyn, Diamond told me about something he had seen the night before. He had been monitoring the Yankees' playoff game on the internet, not because he cares about baseball but because the heavy crowds during the postseason often spur rare service patterns. His instinct was right. ""Trains started at Yankee Stadium and went down the D line to 36th Street, then switched over to the N line to Coney Island, then continued through the Coney Island terminal, before switching to the Q line to Brighton Beach,"" Diamond told me. This sort of move wouldn't be possible in most other cities, where subway lines operate independently, but in New York they overlap and intersect, making a single, cohesive, interchangeable whole. ""It was actually pretty brilliant,"" he said in a reverent tone, as the blue sky in front of us began to darken."
News,2018-01-03,"In Seattle, the neighbors don’t want apartments for formerly homeless seniors nearby. In Los Angeles, they don’t want more high-rises.

In Los Angeles, they don't want more high-rises. In San Jose, Calif., they don't want tiny homes. In Phoenix, they don't want design that's not midcentury modern. Homeowners in each of these places share a common conviction: that owning a parcel of land gives them a right to shape the world beyond its boundaries. The roots of this idea are as old as nuisance laws that have tried to limit how one property owner can harm another. Over the decades, though, homeowners have expanded their claim on the world beyond their lot lines. This means they look out for schools and streets in ways that are vital to American communities. But increasingly it also means the senior affordable housing, the high-rises and the tiny homes — also arguably vital to the larger community — are never built. ""One of the reasons why we always justified the mortgage interest deduction was we wanted people to be rooted in their communities,"" said Vicki Been, the faculty director of New York University's Furman Center and a former commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development in New York City. The idea was for people to be invested in the quality of nearby schools, the safety of neighborhood parks and the outcomes of local elections. In one sense, the triumph of this idea should be celebrated, she said. But the danger of it is becoming more apparent, too. ""Communities always need to be changing,"" she said, ""and we can't have a process that gives every individual sort of a veto over change."" The new tax law has raised the possibility that homeownership may be losing some of its privileged status in American society, as the benefits of the mortgage interest and property tax deductions shrink. Those changes could dampen how attractive housing looks as an asset. But it would take much more to alter the belief that owning a home in America today means that you effectively own a neighborhood, too. That notion didn't make much sense when most Americans lived on farms, where the neighbors were remote and the value of property came primarily from what happened on it. The boom in city living changed both of these things. ""As people are increasingly living in urban areas really close to each other, it starts to be the case that so much of the value of your property is bound up in things that are happening outside of your parcel,"" said Lee Fennell, a law professor at the University of Chicago who has written about what she calls the ""unbounded"" nature of our homes. In denser living, a trash dump or a park next door affects the value of your parcel. So does the access to jobs, the ease of transportation and the amenities nearby. The story of how Americans came to peer beyond their own properties is also, inescapably, about race. As urbanization brought blacks and whites closer together, white communities reacted with racially restrictive covenants, aiming to keep blacks and their perceived threat to property values out of white neighborhoods. The Supreme Court ruled such covenants unenforceable in 1948, but they had long-lasting effects on how homeowners looked at the world around them, and the need to control it. ""One of them was to make white people think that the value of their homes depended on living in a segregated community,"" said Carol Rose, a law professor at Yale. ""That outlived racially restrictive covenants."" Another shift came with the advent of citywide zoning in New York City in 1916. Nuisance laws had targeted problems like noxious odors or chemical spills that crept across property lines. Zoning, rather than punishing people for proven harms that came from their property, told people what they could do on their property in the first place. And it prohibited many things — like buildings of a certain height — that had never been considered nuisances before. Zoning effectively invited homeowners to look beyond their properties in ways they hadn't. And it helped create the expectation that communities would change little over time — or that homeowners would have a say if they did. ""Prior to zoning, you didn't ask yourself if you were buying a piece of property, 'What's the use of the land next to me, or down the block, or half a mile away?' "" said William Fischel, an economist at Dartmouth. ""Zoning becomes an opportunity for you to think outside the box of the lot lines of your own property. And people definitely start doing it."" Americans fretted about property values in the early 20th century (and government documents at the time warned of how racial integration would harm them). But Americans didn't broadly begin to think of homeownership as a means to create wealth until around the 1970s, when housing started to appreciate faster than many other assets. And once housing became a financial asset — the largest one many families own — homeowners began to take more seriously anything they feared would harm it, Mr. Fischel said. ""The mere possibility that a funeral home three blocks away might cause a funeral procession to go down a street just when a buyer's there, these remote threats — almost imaginary threats — start to become more resonant,"" Mr. Fischel said. And so homeowners tried to deploy nuisance laws against funeral homes. When solar panels grew more common in the 1970s, homeowners did the same with neighbors who might block their sunlight. ""That's very different from chemical spills,"" Ms. Been said of both threats. In the 1980s, people who bought country homes claimed nuisances from the noise and smell of nearby farms, prompting ""right to farm"" laws. In the 1980s and 1990s, homeowners turned to gated communities to control what nuisance laws couldn't: a community's aesthetic, a neighbor's pets, another property's landscaping. In the 1990s, Ms. Been said, neighbors increasingly defended not just individual buildings against change, but also a broader sense of neighborhood ""character,"" with fights couched in the language of rights. ""It's moved from just being 'I should have a right to confront something that hurts my house' to 'I have an interest in this neighborhood as a whole,' "" Ms. Been said. And as residential mobility rates have declined, she suggests, Americans are staking even stronger claims to their neighborhoods, with renters now behaving in ways we once associated more with homeowners. These forces amount to a powerful brew: Our homes have become our wealth. Racial fears linger even if they've become encoded in other language. Change invariably looks like a threat. And the universe of threats has broadened from the toxic spill to the garden shadow, from the property next door to the potential development five blocks over. ""We ask home equity to do so much more for us in terms of providing retirement, providing a bridge during drought years, allowing us to have collateral for other kinds of loans,"" said Nathan Connolly, a historian at Johns Hopkins University. ""Then you add schools and crime into the mix."" ""To the extent that people can control anything,"" he said of property values, ""they try to control for that."" No wonder it has become so hard to untangle the benefits of community ""ownership"" from the rising harms. We want people to be invested in their neighborhoods, but not to the exclusion of anyone else who might live there, too. We want to empower neighbors to fight a trash dump, but not to halt every housing project the region needs. ""Who speaks for the community as a whole?"" Ms. Been said. ""I worry about that."""
News,2018-01-03,Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/business/dealbook/ant-financial-moneygram-trump.html,3192," Good Wednesday. Here's what we're watching: • Tesla pushes back its Model 3 production targets again. • Manafort's lawsuit faces a tough road. • Researchers discover two major flaws in the world's computers. • Spotify filed confidentially to go public. • The death of Ant Financial's bid to buy MoneyGram raises questions about how useful close ties to President Trump are. • Dominion Energy and Scana are combining. • Underwriting for free. Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. The electric carmaker said it delivered 1,550 Model 3s in the fourth quarter and would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter. Those numbers were well below analyst expectations and Tesla's past forecasts. In September, analysts predicted that Telsa would deliver 15,900 Model 3s in the fourth quarter. That number had come down since then. Prior to Wednesday's announcement, the consensus among analysts was 4,100, or more than double what Tesla actually delivered. Meanwhile, the forecast of 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter is half the number it had earlier promised. The company now says it will produce 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of the second quarter. Critics corner: ""The premise of the stock's sky-high valuation has long been of Tesla eventually dominating the auto industry. That notion has hardly ever seemed more fanciful,"" writes Heard on the Street's Charley Grant. The news hasn't spooked investors much. Shares are down just 2 percent after the close. Lawyers know that there are many paths to getting a good result. When one is blocked, then look for another one. The lawsuit filed by Paul J. Manafort Jr., the former campaign chairman for President Trump, against the Justice Department, deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein, and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is an effort to find a backdoor way to block the criminal charges filed against him last October. The Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear, most recently in 2014 in Kaley v. United States, that defendants cannot attack a grand jury indictment by claiming that they are innocent. That's what a trial is for, so once indicted the only alternative is to go to trial. But that's a risky path, especially for Mr. Manafort who will face a jury from Washington, D.C., a venue that is not very hospitable to Republicans. To avoid a trial, Mr. Manafort asked the court to stop the case because it is unrelated to any Russian interference with the 2016 election. The lawsuit claims that Mr. Mueller exceeded the limits of his appointment as special counsel, comparing the indictment to the discredited independent counsel law that led to drawn out investigations of President Bill Clinton and others in the 1990s. Can it work? Federal judges have a strong aversion to interfering with prosecutors, routinely refusing to second guess decisions about who to prosecute and what to charge. So Mr. Manafort faces a tough road if he wants to find a means to block Mr. Mueller from dragging him into court. Deciding whether one is guilty is usually left to the jury, not a judge saying who should and shouldn't be prosecuted. — Peter J. Henning Those are the names of two major security flaws found in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world's computers. The Meltdown flaw affects virtually every Intel microprocessor, which are used in more than 90 percent of computer servers. Spectre affects most other processors now in use, though the researchers believe this flaw is more difficult to exploit. From Cade Metz and Nicole Perloth of the NYT: ""The two problems could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of a computer. There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent — an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services."" The business implications are unclear for chip makers, who may have to eventually swap out all affected hardware to eradicate the threats. The researchers notified the affected companies but had tried to keep the news from the public so hackers could not take advantage of the flaws before they were fixed. The Register, a British science and technology website, reported news of the Meltdown flaw, spurring the researchers to release papers describing the flaws much earlier than they had planned. Intel's shares fell 3.4 percent Wednesday. Rivals Advance Micro Devices and Nvidia jumped 5.2 percent and 6.6 percent respectively. The tax overhaul signed into law last month should boost corporate bottom lines. The bad news? The gains could be shortlived. Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its 2018 earnings forecast for the Standard & Poor's 500 index to $153 from $139. ""The biggest impact on earnings from tax reform comes from the lowering of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, making up roughly $10 of the $14 increase. Buybacks representanother $3 of the increase, with some modest offsets from the minimum foreign tax rate and the cap on interest deductions."" But tax reform may weigh on corporate profits in 2019.The bank forecasts earnings of $161 in 2019. ""While tax reform should provide a big boost to 2018 earnings growth, there are several reasons to expect it to be a headwind to growth in subsequent years. First, economic theory suggests that higher returns should incentivize additional competition, which should have a negative impact on margins over time, especially with many traditional industries already facing increasing disruption. Second, stronger growth could result in more aggressive Fed tightening, which could eventually weigh on overall economic growth."" Which sectors stand to get biggest earnings boost this year from the cut to the corporate tax rate? consumer discretionary and telecom. Why? The two sectors generate more of their revenue domestically and have a higher average tax rate. Not Spotify it seems. The music streaming service filed confidentially to go public through a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, according to reports. The NYT reported in May that the company was leaning toward such a listing. A direct listing is exceedingly rare and bypasses the traditional initial public offering process that virtually every other company uses to begin trading on the markets. Direct listings essentially move trading in a company's stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing. By eschewing an I.P.O., Spotify is not seeking to raise additional money. Wall Street and Silicon Valley will watch Spotify's listing closely. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. Wall Street is unlikely to cheer such a development. Direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O. That's essentially what is happening in Asia. The Wall Street Journal reports that three state-owned Indian companies paid a dollar in underwriting fees to seven banks, including Barclays and Standard Chartered, for their work selling a total of $1.3 billion in dollar-denominated bonds. While those fees may be unusually low, they highlight a trend in the region: ""Underwriting revenue, while also up from a year ago, isn't keeping up with the accelerating pace of Asian corporate bond issuance. That is raising concerns that underwriting ""could become largely unprofitable"" in Asia. In the United States, companies, on average, pay fees of 0.7 percentage point for an investment-grade corporate bond issue and 1.2 percentage points for underwriting a junk bond offering. So much for the charm offensive last year by Jack Ma: U.S. officials have effectively killed a $1.2 billion takeover bid by one of his companies for MoneyGram. The failure of Ant Financial, an electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, to win approval from an American national security watchdog raises questions of how much being friendly to President Trump ultimately helps. If it's true that White House officials are clashing over how hard a negotiating stance to take with countries like China over trade, this development suggests that the hawks might have the upper hand right now. Who should be worried • Foreign companies, particularly Chinese ones, seeking to buy American counterparts. (Think also of Broadcom, which is legally headquartered in Singapore and which is pursuing Qualcomm — and has assiduously courted Mr. Trump.) • Domestic companies looking to merge in contested situations, despite having unofficial support from the president. (Think Disney and Fox, whose proposed transaction raised antitrust concerns but garnered praise from Mr. Trump.) • American companies looking to do business in China, who may now face retaliatory blowback. Critics' corner • Lex writes, ""With the demise of this payments merger, any Chinese company wanting to buy anything of significance in the U.S. should give up."" (Lex) • Richard Beales writes, ""If it's a rebuke, it's one that's conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment."" (Breakingviews) Dominion Energy has agreed to buy Scana Corporation in an all-stock deal valued at $14.6 billion, including debt. Scana shareholders will receive 0.669 shares of Dominion Energy for each share held. That's about $53.71 a share based on Dominion's stock price at Tuesday's close and a 28 percent premium. Shares of Scana jumped 22 percent on the news, while Dominion slipped 4 percent. Scana has struggled since this summer when it abandoned two unfinished nuclear reactors in South Carolina. The project was once expected to showcase advanced nuclear technology but was plagued by delays and cost overruns. Scana's shares are down more than 40 percent since midsummer. Height Securities via Axios warns that the deal has ways to go before it closes. ""In this case especially, Dominion will have to pull out all the stops to demonstrate that their offer is the best deal for customers, particularly given the uncertainty facing [SCANA's] rates over the coming months. We're looking for a reaction from the Governor as well as House Speaker Jay Lucas and the PSC commissioners for early signs of whether Dominion's proposal will fall flat."" Where Bitcoin traded early yesterday: $13,833 Where Bitcoin is trading this morning: $15,202 What happened: It was probably the revelation that the venture capitalist Peter Thiel has made a big bet on the digital currency. From Rob Copeland of the WSJ: Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firm's most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments. Has Founders Fund made money? The WSJ reports, citing unidentified sources, that the firm bought about $15 million in Bitcoin and that its stake is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Bitcoin flyaround • John O'Rourke, the head of Riot Blockchain, a small biotech-turned-digital currency company, has made at least $712,000 on price increase of more than 60 percent after the company added blockchain to its name. (CNBC) • The penny-stock company TGI Solar Power Group enjoyed a surge in its stock price (though not quite what Long Blockchain, nee Long Island Iced Tea, experienced last month) after it announced a move into digital currencies. Its stock went as high as 0.2 cent. (Bloomberg) • Speaking of Long Blockchain, the company has added two new board members as part of its pivot from cold beverages to cryptocurrency. (WSJ) • Criminals are turning to a new breed of virtual currency, because Bitcoin's underlying technology can work against them. (Bloomberg) It isn't just the fact that Mitt Romney, a sometimes vociferous critic of the president, is expected to run for Mr. Hatch's Senate seat. It's that another Republican lawmaker who has been relatively friendly to Mr. Trump is stepping down before the 2018 midterm elections — which could whittle down the G.O.P.'s control of Congress. More from Jonathan Martin of the NYT: Mr. Romney's potential ascent is particularly alarming to the White House because the former presidential candidate has an extensive political network and could use the Senate seat as a platform to again seek the nomination. Even if he were not to run again for president, a Senator Romney could prove a pivotal swing vote, impervious to the entreaties of a president he has scorned and able to rally other Trump skeptics in the chamber. He's running, probably: While Mr. Romney didn't issue a statement on his potential candidacy, he did change his location on Twitter from ""Massachusetts"" to ""Holladay, Utah."" Also worth noting The Washington flyaround • Republican and Democratic lawmakers will meet today with White House officials to try and reach a spending deal before Jan. 19 — or face a government shutdown. (NYT) • The founders of the research firm Fusion GPS, which has been at the heart of the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, criticized Republican attacks on those inquiries in an NYT Op-Ed.

(Bloomberg) • BP said it would take a roughly $1.5 billion accounting charge for its latest quarter because of the tax overhaul.

(Bloomberg) • Michele Bachmann, the former Minnesota congresswoman and 2012 Republican presidential candidate, said she was considering running for Al Franken's Senate seat. (Axios) • Vice Media placed its president, Andrew Creighton, and its chief digital officer, Mike Germano, on leave after the NYT reported on sexual harassment allegations against them. (NYT) • The Showtime political documentary series ""The Circus"" will return in April without its most recognizable star, Mark Halperin, whose career was felled by allegations of sexual harassment and assault. He will be replaced by the CBS News anchor Alex Wagner and the political analyst Mark McKinnon.

(NYT) Oil is at its highest level since 2015, edging up this morning toward $67 a barrel. Geopolitical risks, like protests in Iran, have prompted buying, while production curbs by OPEC members have tightened supply. That rise is expected to continue. More from David Sheppard of the FT: While global oil demand is forecast to rise by about 1.4m barrels a day next year, growing US shale output combined with new projects in Brazil and Canada are broadly expected to see non-OPEC supply rise by a similar amount. Hedge funds are, however, betting that prices are likely to head higher, with some arguing that geopolitical unrest — including in OPEC member Venezuela, where oil output has been falling — should keep prices well supported. Blackstone's Byron Wien reckons that ""populism, tribalism and anarchy"" could push oil above $80 a barrel this year. The hedge fund's latest victory: Alexion Pharmaceuticals said that it would work with the activist investor on finding a new director for its board. From a statement by David Brennan, Alexion's chairman: We have been actively working to expand and diversify our board, and we welcome input from Elliott to identify a strong director candidate to further strengthen Alexion's board. The context: Michael broke the news last month that Elliott had built up a stake in the drug maker and was weighing a proxy fight if the company didn't change elements of its business strategy. The broader landscape: For companies under pressure from activists, resistance requires deft maneuvering, according to Breakingviews. Procter & Gamble's expensive, hard-line defense against Nelson Peltz failed, but both G.M. and Automatic Data Processing have shown that fending off hedge funds is possible.

News,2018-01-03,"JERUSALEM — If President Trump’s goal with a pair of tweets threatening to cut their funding was to compel Palestinians, one way or another, to return to peace negotiations, they appear to have had the opposite effect — and left many Israelis confused and worried as well.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/middleeast/trump-israel-palestinians-twitter.html,1126," JERUSALEM — If President Trump's goal with a pair of tweets threatening to cut their funding was to compel Palestinians, one way or another, to return to peace negotiations, they appear to have had the opposite effect — and left many Israelis confused and worried as well. ""We pay the Palestinians HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter while most of the Middle East was sleeping on Wednesday. ""With the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace,"" he added, ""why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?"" Mr. Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital last month, upending decades of American policy that had long avoided prejudging future negotiations over the city and prompting the Palestinians to declare that the administration no longer had a role to play in the peace talks. The tweets, on a day Mr. Trump also took jabs at Iran, North Korea and Pakistan, echoed remarks made hours earlier by Nikki R. Haley, his ambassador to the United Nations. Ms. Haley threatened that the United States would stop providing financial support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which assists Palestinian refugees throughout the region, unless the Palestinians returned to the negotiating table. As the largest donor to the relief agency, the United States provided more than $355 million in support for its 2016 operations, including $95 million for a West Bank and Gaza emergency appeal. Washington also provided about $290 million last year to the Palestinians through the United States Agency for International Development and has provided about $5.2 billion in total since 1994. ""We will not be blackmailed,"" Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, said in a statement on Wednesday. ""President Trump has sabotaged our search for peace, freedom and justice. Now he dares to blame the Palestinians for the consequences of his own irresponsible actions!"" Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, was also angry. ""Jerusalem and its holy places are not for sale,'' he said, ""not with gold nor with silver."" For Israelis, too, Mr. Trump's tweets presented a problem and, inscrutable as a Talmudic text in parts, were left open to some feverish interpretation. Mr. Trump was unclear about what funding he would cut and said that his administration had ""taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table."" The statement appeared to contradict his own assurances, and those of other American officials, that the boundaries of Israeli sovereignty within Jerusalem were still up for discussion. He also said that the Israelis ""would have had to pay more"" for the recognition of their capital, suggesting that the country would have had to reciprocate with significant concessions to the Palestinians. The relationship between Israel and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency is complicated. Israel has accused the agency of perpetuating the Palestinian refugee problem, while at the same time valuing the education, health care and food assistance it provides to more than two million Palestinians registered as refugees in the West Bank and Gaza. Without the agency's assistance, Israelis worry they would have to shoulder the cost. Any drastic cut in funding, either to the agency or to the Palestinian Authority and its security forces, would most likely destabilize these areas, according to experts. Even some Israelis who are generally critical of the Palestinians, and would eventually like to see the United Nations Relief and Works Agency disappear, expressed reservations about any sudden cut in donations. ""Instead of being refugees forever they could build their present and their future,"" said Yaakov Amidror, a former national security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and now a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategic Studies, a conservative think tank. ""But to stop all the money that is going to Unrwa overnight would be devastating. It should be a process during which the Palestinians take on responsibility and slowly, slowly Unrwa ceases to exist."" The Trump administration had anticipated an outburst of Palestinian anger over its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but it had also expected the Palestinians to resume work on the peace process after what American officials called a ""cooling off"" period. Left to parse Mr. Trump's tweet about Jerusalem now being off the table, Israeli analysts said they assumed he was referring only to recognition of Israel's capital in western Jerusalem, not the eastern part that the Palestinians claim as their capital of a future state, and that much of the world considers occupied territory. ""It's not my responsibility to be the Rashi of President Trump,"" Mr. Amidror said, referring to a medieval French rabbi and Talmudic commentator. ""What is clear is that the issue of all of Jerusalem is not off the table. It's on the table and it should be negotiated."" Michael Herzog, an Israel-based fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has participated in most of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, said that many Israelis supported some cuts in external funding to the Palestinian Authority, given that part of its budget goes to supporting the families of Palestinians who carried out terrorist attacks against Israelis. But the Israeli government would not want to see the collapse of the Palestinian Authority, he said. Mr. Herzog believes that Mr. Abbas was afraid of receiving an American proposal or peace plan that he could not accept, but also did not want to have to say no to it. ""The issue of the recognition of Jerusalem provided him with the perfect excuse and an escape from this process,"" Mr. Herzog said. ""Basically, Trump was responding to this."" Mr. Trump's comments were met with silence from the Israeli prime minister's office and the Foreign Ministry. Some Israeli politicians on the right welcomed the fact Mr. Trump had clearly blamed the Palestinians for the stalled peace process, and they even praised the idea of reducing financial support. ""President Trump is not afraid to say the truth, even if it's not popular,"" said Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party. ""The truth is the U.S. has no interest in funding those who act against its interest. The truth is the Palestinian leadership continues to fund terrorists, using U.S. tax money."" But other Israelis focused on the risks that cuts could bring. ""A serious and responsible government would stop mixing politics with Israeli security and would sit quietly and discreetly with the American president and explain to him what the real Israeli interest is,"" Tzipi Livni, a former foreign and justice minister, who now sits in the opposition, wrote on Twitter. That, she added, includes ""avoiding a humanitarian crisis in Gaza and continuing cooperation with the Palestinian security forces."""
News,2018-01-03,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-sharing company, agreed to acquire full control of 99 — the main Brazilian rival to Uber and a company in which Didi already holds a stake — for around $600 million, according to three people with knowledge of the transaction.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/technology/didi-chuxing-99-brazil-ride-hailing.html,701," RIO DE JANEIRO — Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-sharing company, agreed to acquire full control of 99 — the main Brazilian rival to Uber and a company in which Didi already holds a stake — for around $600 million, according to three people with knowledge of the transaction. The all-cash deal changes the global competitive landscape for ride-hailing companies, particularly Uber and Didi, the industry's two biggest players. The companies have been locked in a struggle to be the dominant force in as many regions as possible, with fast-growing markets like South America, and Brazil specifically, seen as huge prizes. Didi on Thursday confirmed the deal without disclosing financial details. Uber and Didi have teamed up in some countries, including China, but Didi's decision to buy a major Uber competitor in Brazil puts the companies at loggerheads in Latin America. The deal also reflects Didi's effort to accelerate its global footprint outside China. In December, the company raised $4 billion in financing from investors that included the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, partly to fuel that expansion. Didi previously owned around 30 percent of 99, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Members of Didi's technology and engineering team have been in Brazil working with employees at 99, which is based in São Paulo, for about a year, these people said. The new deal calls for Didi to pay roughly $600 million for the shares of 99 that it does not already own, giving it complete control of the Brazilian company, the people said. Didi has also agreed to put additional cash into 99. The acquisition will help 99's previous investors — a group that includes SoftBank, Riverwood Capital, Qualcomm Ventures and Monashees — cash out, representing a rare successful exit for investors in Brazilian internet start-ups. Peter Fernandez, 99's chief executive, is expected to stay on at the company, as are other top executives, the people familiar with the transaction said. Brazil is likely to remain the company's focus, although it may also expand elsewhere in Latin America. ""Globalization is a top strategic priority for Didi,"" Cheng Wei, Didi's founder and chief executive, said in a statement. Talks between the companies were previously reported by The Information, a technology news website. With a population of about 210 million and underdeveloped public transportation networks, Brazil is a lucrative market for ride-hailing companies. But the country has moved to create barriers for such services, including legislative efforts to require drivers to show licenses and proof of ownership of the cars they use, although those rules were eventually modified. 99, originally named 99Taxis and founded in 2012, focused initially on working with licensed taxi drivers, taxi unions and government regulators. Uber entered Brazil two years later, and the companies have battled each other since. By the end of 2015, 99 had the most Brazilian users with the app on their mobile devices, according to data from research firm 7Park Data, with another ride-hailing company, Easy Taxi, in second place and Uber in third. In 2016, 99 had trouble securing additional financing amid an economic and political crisis in Brazil. That year, Paulo Veras, the company's co-founder and then chief executive, brought on Mr. Fernandez to be chief product officer. Mr. Fernandez later succeeded Mr. Veras and was tasked with finding global strategic partners for 99. In an interview with The New York Times last May, Mr. Fernandez said: ""When I joined the company, my top priority was to reach out to Didi. I was impressed with things Didi was doing in transportation."" In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Fernandez said that 99 was ""confident that being part of Didi Chuxing will vastly enhance our capability to expand our services throughout Brazil to bring critical value to users, drivers and cities."" Didi has said it was drawn to 99's initial approach of working with regulators and taxi drivers instead of against them. In an interview with The Times last year, Stephen Zhu, a senior vice president at Didi, said: ""99 shares a lot of similarities with Didi in terms of business model and its evolution. Their culture and philosophy is very similar to ours."""
News,2018-01-03,"A Turkish banker was convicted on Wednesday of taking part in a billion-dollar scheme to evade American sanctions against Iran, in a case that painted a picture of high-level corruption in Turkey and heightened tensions between the United States and a NATO ally.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/europe/turkey-iran-sanctions-trial.html,1143," A Turkish banker was convicted on Wednesday of taking part in a billion-dollar scheme to evade American sanctions against Iran, in a case that painted a picture of high-level corruption in Turkey and heightened tensions between the United States and a NATO ally. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was not charged in the indictment, but he seemed to loom over the Federal District Court case in Manhattan during the monthlong trial and even before it began. Testimony suggested that he had approved the sanctions-busting scheme. Mr. Erdogan and other Turkish officials had bitterly denounced the charges against the banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, and eight co-defendants, and repeatedly urged American officials to drop the case. Mr. Erdogan even took the matter up with President Trump. The case was followed closely in Turkey, where the government was already angry at the United States for giving shelter to a cleric Mr. Erdogan says was behind a coup attempt in 2016. Mr. Atilla, the deputy general manager for international banking at Halkbank, a Turkish state bank, was the only defendant to be tried. A co-defendant, Reza Zarrab, a wealthy gold trader, pleaded guilty shortly before the trial began and became the star prosecution witness. The seven other defendants are still at large. Mr. Atilla, 47, was described by prosecutors as a ""fixer"" who helped Iran circumvent the sanctions and gain access to billions of dollars of restricted petrodollar funds that were being held at the bank. In testimony over seven days, Mr. Zarrab described an illicit operation that relied on false documents and front companies. He also described support from the highest levels of the Turkish government, as well as from Iranian officials and Halkbank, an institution that prosecutors said was critical to the scheme's success. Mr. Zarrab testified that in 2012, Mr. Erdogan, then Turkey's prime minister, ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in the sanctions evasion scheme. He also told the jury that he had paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to Zafer Caglayan, then Turkey's economy minister, and additional bribes to Suleyman Aslan, the general manager of Halkbank, for help in facilitating the operation. Mr. Caglayan and Mr. Aslan are among the defendants still at large in the case. Mr. Zarrab, 34, testified that he had made as much as $150 million from the scheme. Prosecutors portrayed Mr. Atilla as a sanctions expert who designed the complex scheme and then lied to United States Treasury Department officials about it. He lied again, they argued, when he testified in his own defense at the trial. ""Why did Mr. Atilla tell all those lies?"" Michael D. Lockard, a federal prosecutor, said in a closing argument. ""To help his bank, to help his bank's customers — customers like Mr. Zarrab, customers like the government of Iran, the Central Bank of Iran, the National Iranian Oil Company. Lies that he told to keep his bank from being blacklisted from the American financial system."" Mr. Atilla denied that he had conspired with Mr. Zarrab or that he had been involved in any other wrongdoing. The jury returned its verdict on its fourth day of deliberations. Mr. Atilla was convicted of five of the six counts against him, including bank fraud and conspiracies to violate the Iran sanctions, to defraud the United States, to commit bank fraud and to commit money laundering. He was acquitted on one count, money laundering. Mr. Atilla is to be sentenced on April 11 by Judge Richard M. Berman. The bank fraud count alone carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. Victor J. Rocco, one of Mr. Atilla's lawyers, said his client would appeal. ""We believe he is innocent, and he intends, most importantly, to continue to fight and clear his name,"" he said. Mr. Erdogan has said that the case was based on fabricated evidence. And during a recent interview on the news channel 24 TV, Turkey's justice minister, Abdulhamit Gul, assailed the credibility of the entire proceeding. ""A final ruling on this will mean nothing to us,"" he said. ""This is a tragedy in the judiciary with no legal foundations, turning into a comedy over time."" The case had been an important one for federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who were the object of much criticism from Turkish officials. In November, Turkey said it had opened an investigation of Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan whose office announced the original charges in 2016, and of his successor, Joon H. Kim, who oversaw the prosecution through the trial. After the verdict, Mr. Kim, the acting United States attorney, said: ""Foreign banks and bankers have a choice. You can choose willfully to help Iran and other sanctioned nations evade U.S. law, or you can choose to be part of the international banking community transacting in U.S. dollars. But you can't do both."" As the trial began, Mr. Erdogan and other Turkish officials made strenuous efforts to play down its significance. More recently, as they awaited a verdict, they struck a tone of confidence that they had ridden out the worst. Most Turkish newspapers were predicting a favorable verdict, and analysts said the government, which controls most of the media in Turkey, had managed to frame the trial as an American plot. On his way back from Africa on Dec. 27, Mr. Erdogan told pro-government reporters on his presidential plane that he expected Mr. Atilla would be acquitted. ""I am of the opinion that they have also realized that Atilla is not guilty,"" he said. Political analysts and opposition politicians had suggested that whatever the verdict, Mr. Erdogan was likely to emerge unscathed, but that Turkish banks — and consequently the Turkish economy — might be hurt. ""The economic downside is more important than the political effect,"" said Sinan Ulgen, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe. ""It would be unrealistic to expect an immediate challenge to the government."" Gonul Tol, director of the Middle East Institute's Center for Turkish Studies, said a conviction might not have many consequences. ""First,"" she said, ""the Turkish nation has never been very sensitive about corruption. Also, in a period of strong anti-U.S. feeling, the government successfully managed to frame it."" Initial reaction to Mr. Atilla's conviction, which Turks learned about late in the evening, seemed to bear that out. Pro-government Twitter accounts began promoting a hashtag meaning ""We Will Not Bow Down to the U.S.A."" One post read: ""The judge and the prosecutors are dubious, fake evidence, scandalous experts. They set up this plot in front of our eyes, they are playing."" Selva Tor, a former banker and political analyst who has criticized the United States policy of enforcing its laws on foreign citizens, wondered why the Turkish government was not protecting a citizen. ""Not only Hakan Atilla,"" she wrote. ""Halkbank and the Turkish banking system are taken as slaves too."""
briefing,2018-01-03,Good morning. ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/briefing/iran-nuclear-button-steve-bannon.html,1285," Good morning. Here's what you need to know: • For the last two years, South Korean officials got urgent messages to the North by using a megaphone to shout across the border. No more. In a sudden thaw ahead of the Winter Olympics in the South, Pyongyang has reopened a telephone hotline so that the two nations can prepare for high-level talks. President Trump's boast on Twitter that he has a ""much bigger"" and more powerful nuclear button than Kim Jong-un, the North's leader, set off a torrent of concern on Twitter, and more than a few jokes. (To be clear, no one has a button.) _____ • In Iran, orchestrated pro-government rallies like the one above received copious coverage in state media as the authorities tried to reestablish order after nearly a week of protests over the economy and the suppression of rights. What sparked the protests? Our veteran correspondent in Tehran reports that President Hassan Rouhani's recent efforts to tap popular resentment, partly by revealing income inequalities, may have worked all too well. _____ • A Twitter storm: On President Trump's first working day of the new year, he ""thumbed his thumbs at convention,"" our White House correspondent writes. His 17 posts included the taunt to North Korea, an expression of support for Iran's anti-government protesters, comments that roiled relations with Pakistan and the Palestinians, and other denunciations. (The Times was one target.) But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump issued a printed statement to essentially excommunicate his former strategist Steve Bannon, in response to a new tell-all book that quoted Mr. Bannon as saying Donald Trump Jr.'s campaign-era meeting with Russians was ""treasonous."" Separately, Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, sued Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. _____ • Big financial news emerged from China, where a growing number of pharmaceutical companies are trying to break into the U.S., seeking regulatory approval to offer their treatments for cancer and other ailments. In the latest move by Beijing to reduce emissions, China is suspending the production of more than 500 car models that do not meet its fuel economy standards. And U.S. officials effectively killed a plan by Ant Financial, the Chinese electronic payments company, to buy MoneyGram, the money transfer company, for $1.2 billion. _____ • The ancient bones of a buried child led archaeologists to new insights on how people — among them the ancestors of living Native Americans — first arrived in the Western Hemisphere. Genetic analysis of the 11,500-year-old skeleton discovered in Alaska strongly suggests that North America was settled by a previously unknown people who originated in Siberia. _____ • And The Times's chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott, discussed some of the high and low points of an extraordinary year. Among their topics: Jordan Peele's ""Get Out,"" above, one of the surprises of the year, whether ""The Last Jedi"" improved or wrecked the ""Star Wars"" franchise, and of course the allegations against Harvey Weinstein and the ensuing fallout. ""Criticism is always personal,"" Ms. Dargis noted, ""and so is movie love."" _____ • Petrobras, Brazil's state oil company, will pay $2.95 billion to settle a U.S. lawsuit over a corruption scandal that has ensnared politicians, executives and two former Brazilian presidents. • China's Didi Chuxing is said to be acquiring 99, Brazil's main Uber rival, a move that will change the global competitive landscape for ride-sharing. • Our Addiction Inc. series examining the U.S. treatment industry includes a look at the lucrative business of urine testing. • Australia is striving to become the world's biggest producer of medicinal cannabis products. • The world's hottest commodity of 2017 was palladium, which soared 55 percent. The metal is used to reduce pollution from gas engines. • U.S. stocks were up. Here's a snapshot of global markets. • ""We are here to demand justice."" Mumbai was brought to a standstill as lower-caste Dalits, or so-called untouchables, protested against violence and marginalization. [The New York Times] • A ""bomb cyclone"" battering the American South is forecast to hit the Eastern U.S., prolonging a stretch of bitter cold and record snow. [The New York Times] • European travel was disrupted by a powerful storm that brought winds of up to 100 miles per hour, lightning and heavy rain, hail and flooding. [The New York Times] • A U.S. court convicted a Turkish banker of taking part in a billion-dollar scheme to violate sanctions against Iran, a case that also cast suspicion on Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. [The New York Times] • A U.S.-based firm said it is entering a possible search area for missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370, and it expects to win a contract from Malaysia ""in coming days"" to resume the hunt. [ABC] • Akita Inu dogs, once unseen outside Japan, are now more popular overseas than in their native country. Breeders credit a 2009 Hollywood film based on the story of the loyal dog immortalized by a statue near Tokyo's Shibuya Station. [The Asahi Shimbun] • One of China's richest tycoons, Richard Liu, asked the public to help trace his lineage. Social media users predicted the discovery of many unknown relatives. [South China Morning Post] Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • If you're sick, stay away from work. If you can't, here's what to do. • Can kindness be taught? • Recipe of the day: For a lasagna night, swap the meat for broccoli rabe. • In northeastern China, an entire factory town is devoted to making — and celebrating — the saxophone, an instrument long denounced for ""decadent music."" Some residents even set their ringtones to Kenny G. • In memoriam. John Portman, 93, the architect who revolutionized hotel designs with futuristic atriums and transformed Asian skylines from Shanghai to Mumbai; Thomas Monson, 90, president of the Mormon Church. • Finally, sync your calendar with the solar system so you'll never miss an eclipse, rocket launch or meteor shower, like the Quadrantids, which have just begun to peak. A new year can bring many changes, but 1999 saw what the Times's Op-Ed page called the ""most audacious gamble in the history of currency"": the launch of the euro, the common European currency. Almost 40 years in the works, the euro was toasted with champagne by finance ministers in the 11 countries where it debuted. Though euro bank notes and coins wouldn't be released until 2002, European banks were required to use the currency in transactions as soon as markets opened on Monday, Jan. 4. Fears of technical glitches meant banks brought in employees en masse: In Frankfurt, one bank alone had 3,200 people working to reprogram its computers. London had 30,000 workers on trading floors and in back offices, even though Britain wasn't even adopting the euro. The switchover took more than a year of planning, months of rewriting software, and full-scale dress rehearsals. But the reward for the banking world's tireless efforts was simply a smooth debut when world markets opened for business. Others received something more concrete to mark the launch: For sharing a birthday with the new currency, each baby born in France on New Year's Day received 100 euros from the Finance Ministry.

Cities and counties across the country have recently elected a new wave of reform-minded prosecutors. But the fines and debt that many of them want to use instead of incarceration can be just as unfair and ineffective as the long sentences they say they reject. In November, Nueces County, Tex., elected a progressive district attorney, Mark Gonzalez. His platform included a promise that he wouldn't prosecute misdemeanor marijuana offenses but would instead mandate a $250 fine and a drug class. That same month, Larry Krasner, who ran on expanding the use of drug courts and diversion programs as alternatives to incarceration, was elected district attorney in Philadelphia. While it's understandable that the election of prosecutors like these who are committed to finding options other than locking people up — a key part of criminal justice reform — has inspired excitement, real change to the system will require that they go a step further to ensure that alternative punishments aren't an unreasonable financial burden. Too often, this is the case. The fine for a misdemeanor is typically about $1,000, which can be unmanageable for a low-income person. This comes on top of many other costs. The application fee a defendant must pay to hire a public defender (appointed because a person charged with a crime cannot afford to pay for an attorney) can be as high as $400. Jail booking fees range from $10 to $100. In some states, defendants can be made to pay fees upward of $200 for the juries who hear their cases. After conviction, victim's panel classes, where some defendants are mandated to hear about victims' experiences and loss, can cost up to $75. Drug courts can and often do make people pay for their own assessment, treatment and frequent drug testing. This system shifts the costs of our criminal justice system to the people processed by the system. Juvenile, traffic, misdemeanor and felony courts all rely on monetary sanctions. Fines, court-user fees, surcharges, assessments, interest, collection and per-payment fees fund everything from local law enforcement departments to county jails. Even some municipal services not connected to law enforcement, like campaign elections, are paid for by fines and fees imposed on citizens convicted of — or simply accused of — breaking the law. These people are paying for the system of justice from which we all benefit, but they cannot afford to do so. They are often poor, unemployed and of color. In research on monetary sanctions in nine states, my research team and I found that many people have trouble navigating the legal process associated with fines and fees, like finding out how much money they owe and meeting minimum payment requirements. Of the 380 people we interviewed, over half received public assistance and a vast majority had problems paying their legal debt. Many people with court debt suffered added consequences related to their indigence — like difficulty meeting other financial obligations, and mental and physical ailments. They also had to answer to the court for their nonpayment. Fines for drug offenses, in particular, can have long-term consequences for people who are unable to pay. In many jurisdictions, if a person cannot pay a court-imposed fine, probation is lengthened, warrants are issued and he or she can even be jailed for nonpayment. The burden is piled on, as interest, surcharges and collection fees are added to unpaid court costs. It doesn't have to be this way. While prosecutors do not directly fine defendants, they have discretion when it comes to which fines and fees they recommend to judges. New prosecutors who are serious about making progressive changes should be aware that alternatives to incarceration like diversion programs and classes and treatment come at a cost — literally. They can reform the justice system without adding the financial burden of fees and classes that defendants must pay for. They should instead search for ways to reduce criminal justice budgets by prioritizing preventive measures proved to decrease recidivism and improve public safety such as free drug and alcohol treatment programs, low-cost housing, restorative justice and job training. To start, lower courts should rely on day fines, where monetary sanctions are determined based on a person's daily wage and the seriousness of the offense. The sanction is proportionate to a person's ability to pay and the degree of harm inflicted. Jurisdictions could reduce justice-related budgets by restructuring drug-sentencing laws to match public opinion and revise the use of mandatory minimum, long-term and life sentences. New prosecutors have the power to stop coloring within the lines of our unjust, unfair and unrealistic systems of justice. By not using punishments that impose financial costs on people, they can create a system that is not reliant on user fees and that improves the way we process, punish and support people charged with and convicted of crimes. Of course, poor defendants who are convicted of crimes should be punished. But let's hold them accountable without building huge debts they cannot pay."
News,2018-01-04,"ALBANY — With a re-election campaign and potentially treacherous political terrain ahead, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo laid out his 2018 agenda on Wednesday, painting a portrait of a state battling the effects of terrorism, sexual harassment and opioid addiction, and under siege from the Trump administration.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/nyregion/albany-cuomo-state-of-the-state.html,1329," ALBANY — With a re-election campaign and potentially treacherous political terrain ahead, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo laid out his 2018 agenda on Wednesday, painting a portrait of a state battling the effects of terrorism, sexual harassment and opioid addiction, and under siege from the Trump administration. In his 90-minute State of the State speech, Mr. Cuomo said the state would challenge the new Republican-led federal tax plan in court — earning a standing ovation from the crowd — and asked the Legislature to restructure the state's tax code by adding a statewide payroll tax and to counter the effects of the so-called carried interest loophole. The governor's office suggested that it was reviewing eliminating the state income tax, whose deductibility was capped by the new federal tax bill, likely in favor of a payroll tax, which is deductible, an idea also being floated in other states. Precise details on the plan were scant, and such a plan would face an uphill battle, with Republicans generally opposing new taxes and some conservative economists already voicing concerns on Wednesday. The proposal to constrain the carried interest loophole — which allows a private equity partner or hedge fund manager to enjoy a lower tax rate on an investment's profits — would call for creating a compact with neighboring states that would impose a new tax on those taking advantage of the loophole. Still, with New York facing billions of dollars in budget gaps, and swaths of suburban voters possibly looking at tax increases as a result of the new cap on income and property tax deductibility, the initial reaction in Albany suggested the idea had a puncher's chance, including among some State Senate Republicans representing moderate districts. And Mr. Cuomo, whose angry rhetoric leading up to the passage of the federal tax bill had bordered on the extreme, seemed to be banking that he could unite New Yorkers on both sides of the aisle to fight against Washington. ""You're now robbing the blue states to pay for the red states,"" the governor said of the federal tax plan, calling it crass, ugly and partisan. ""It is an economic civil war."" Mr. Cuomo's eighth State of the State came amid one of the hardest economic outlooks of his time in office, including a $4 billion budget deficit. It also came at the fulcrum of a critical political moment for the governor, a Democrat expected to easily secure a third term in November whose name has been bandied about as a possible presidential contender in 2020. On one hand, the governor seems eager to use such speeches to reach for the kind of lofty rhetoric that also made his father, the former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a national figure. On Wednesday, in fact, he cited his father on several occasions, saying he was following the former governor's lead as a ""pragmatic progressive"" who had led the state into a position of being ""the nation's vanguard for social progress."" Mr. Cuomo cited accomplishments like raising the minimum wage, legalizing same-sex marriage and establishing a paid family leave program. And the agenda he laid out on Wednesday was a sweeping catchall of blue-sky ideas, from encouraging self-driving cars and drones to building what would be New York City's biggest state park on Jamaica Bay and extending a subway line to Red Hook in Brooklyn. All of which earned it a fair measure of skepticism from conservative leaders. ""I don't know how the heck anyone can conceive of paying for everything that was laid out,"" said John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican and the Senate majority leader, who questioned where the governor would find the funding to enact the myriad proposals. ""I always respect the ambition, but at some point, somebody's got to pay for it."" Edward F. Cox, the State Republican Party chairman, was more dismissive. ""Of course there are a lot of nice things in there that you have to applaud for,"" he said, mentioning the park plan, ""but the basic issues this coming election year are going to be corruption, which he's got plenty of them."" Indeed, Mr. Cuomo faces a daunting array of possible political pitfalls in 2018, including a series of corruption trials of close former aides, allies and associates, and a restive Democratic base hoping for stronger progressive stands from a politician known as a shrewd, if solipsistic, political dealmaker. In particular, the twisted calculus of the State Senate — where New York Republicans hold their sole foothold of power in the state thanks to a partnership with nine rogue Democrats — looks to present problems for the governor if he fails to broker or campaign hard for a Democratic majority, something some left-wing groups question his willingness to do. On Wednesday, however, progressive groups were embracing the idea of a payroll tax. ""It is smart and necessary for states to respond to the federal attack,"" said Michael Kink, executive director of the Strong Economy For All Coalition, a group of unions and community organizations that advocates for tax code reform and a higher minimum wage. Mr. Kink also praised the idea of eliminating the carried interest loophole, which he said hedge funds or private equity funds had long used to avoid paying the highest amount of income tax by classifying the fees they charged for managing investments as long-term capital gains. ""It's an entirely fictional legal accounting thing,"" Mr. Kink said. ""It basically allows them to pay a lower rate than teachers and truck drivers."" Mayor Bill de Blasio, recently re-elected, made the trip to Albany for the speech, receiving a warm applause from the crowd on Wednesday, despite often finding his agenda thwarted in the Capitol. Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio have feuded regularly, and Mr. Cuomo several times obliquely asserted his readiness to insert himself into New York City's affairs, including homelessness, saying he had directed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to increase outreach to homeless men and women. And the city's decaying subways — whose shoddy performance politically damaged the governor, who controls the M.T.A. — was also the source of a request for more financial backing, with Mr. Cuomo taking a veiled swipe at ""cheap political slogans"" that had failed to address the problems of the aging system. But on the issue of taxes, the mayor seemed to set aside any bad blood with the governor, saying he was heartened by the proposal on the payroll tax and calling it a ""creative solution."" ""Look, we want to protect New Yorkers from an unfair tax bill,"" Mr. de Blasio said. ""If there had been any sense in Washington of fairness and decency towards people all over the country, they never would've taken away state and local deductibility."" Perhaps aware of the help he would need in perilous financial times, Mr. Cuomo also repeatedly praised Albany's often-criticized lawmakers, saying he would need them to make hard financial choices, something he has prided himself on in the past, again being pragmatic about the state's needs. ""We should feel confident in our ability to govern,"" he said, ""and to do what many people believe can't be done."" The election of President Trump has given Mr. Cuomo the opportunity to present himself as a steward of progressive policies, and he has spent the better part of the last year attacking Washington — if not always the president by name — to burnish his own political brand. And while Mr. Cuomo mentioned Mr. Trump only once, chiding him for fomenting a divisive political culture, he characterized the cumulative effect of his administration as a ""federal assault"" that he likened to President Ford's 1975 decision to deny bankruptcy aid to the city (resulting in the famed ""FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD"" headline in The Daily News.) ""This federal government is the most hostile and aggressive toward New York in history,"" the governor said. ""It has shot an arrow aimed at New York's economic heart."""

Here's what you need to know: • A strong winter storm tore through much of Europe, battering homes with hail and heavy rain, flooding streets and disrupting flights. At least one person was reported killed in France. (Above, a train carriage pushed off the tracks by wind gusts in Switzerland.) Expect more cold wind and rain in the coming days, but nothing to compare with Wednesday's. Meanwhile in the U.S., residents of the Northeast are preparing for power failures and travel disruption as a winter storm is forecast to prolong a stretch of bitter cold and record snow. (Climate change may be partly to blame.) _____ • In Tehran, Iran's capital, residents are sitting out the protests that have spread to other cities, unlike in 2009, when millions of middle-class people erupted in anger over an election they saw as rigged. The state news media gave copious coverage to orchestrated pro-government rallies as the authorities tried to re-establish order. There remains no evidence for Iranian leaders' claim that foreign meddling had instigated the protests, but history does offer reasons for such suspicion. European reluctance to side more openly with the protesters is the latest divergence of approach with the Trump administration, which has openly praised demonstrators. _____ • President Trump excommunicated his former chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, saying, in a written statement brimming with anger, that Mr. Bannon had ""lost his mind."" (Here's the full text.) Mr. Bannon is quoted in a new book saying that a Trump team meeting with Russians during the campaign was ""treasonous"" and that the special counsel in the Russia inquiry would ""crack Don Jr. like an egg on national TV."" Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, sued the special counsel, arguing that his investigation had exceeded its mandate. Separately, Mr. Trump ended an inquiry spurred by his false claims of voter fraud in the 2016 election. _____ • On his first working day in 2018, President Trump's 17 tweets offered a snapshot of his combative approach to this year's agenda. Among other things, Mr. Trump wrote that he wanted to tie Palestinian aid to peace talks. Many Israelis, even some who are generally critical of the Palestinians, see risks in that tactic. We took a closer look at the United Nations agency known as Unrwa, which handles much of that aid. _____ • Computer security experts have discovered two major security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world's mobile devices, personal computers and servers running in cloud computer networks. There is no evidence that hackers have taken advantage of the vulnerability, at least so far. • A growing number of Chinese pharmaceutical companies are trying to expand overseas, seeking U.S. regulatory approval to offer treatments for cancer and other ailments. • Iceland has started to put in place a new law requiring companies with 25 employees or more to prove that they are not paying women less than men. • Russia and Venezuela have floated plans to create homegrown virtual currencies that would put them outside the global financial and banking system. • Spotify's plans to file for an I.P.O. in New York could shine some light on the economics underlying streaming music. • Here's a snapshot of global markets. • The Koreas reopened a telephone hotline to prepare for talks on easing tensions and including the North in the Winter Olympics. (To be clear, there is no one button to trigger a nuclear war). [The New York Times] • Britain's National Health Service, depleted by budget cuts, is under the highest strain in decades. [The New York Times] • President Emmanuel Macron of France proposed new legislation to combat ""fake news,"" which would allow the authorities to seek the blocking of websites and require sites to be more transparent on paid content. [Reuters] • A meeting of the prime ministers of Hungary and Poland underlined how their vision of the European Union contrasted with renewed efforts in Brussels to reinvigorate integration. [Politico] • A U.S. court convicted a Turkish banker of taking part in a billion-dollar scheme to violate sanctions against Iran, a case that also cast suspicion on Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. [The New York Times] • Ethiopia's government, under pressure amid protests, has pledged to close a notorious detention center and release some inmates, some of them thought to be political prisoners. [The New York Times] • The Italian news media called it a ""movie-worthy heist"": A Qatari royal's jewels were stolen in a brazen theft in Venice. [The New York Times] • You've probably heard that New York City's subway is falling apart. In the latest installment of our series investigating its problems, our magazine writer argues that the city must rebuild it to survive. [The New York Times Magazine] Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • Recipe of the day: For a lasagna night, swap the meat for broccoli rabe. • It's never too early to encourage kids to be givers, not takers. • If you're sick, try to stay away from work. If you can't, here's what to do. • The diary above is a rare account of life in the Gulag, the Soviet system of forced labor camps. It is now being exhibited in Moscow, at a time when attitudes toward Russia's past have become less critical. • In Naples, a new exhibition that puts rarely seen ruins from Pompeii in contemporary confines speaks to the recent revitalization of a city that has seen so much in its long history. • Ulrich Wegener, the West German police commando who led the 1977 raid that rescued 90 people from a hijacked plane in Somalia, died at 88. • We talked to Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks about President Trump, the fallout from the Harvey Weinstein case and why they hadn't worked together until ""The Post.""

During the workday, the satchel sat on a file cabinet in Behzadzadeh's small office at Avicenna, stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars that funded the two operations. One weekday afternoon last March, Avicenna's manager, Alex Elsberg, a bearish, bearded man with blue-tinted sunglasses perched on his crown, was prepared to drive a 100-mile circuit around Denver's north suburbs, where he would deliver concentrate to one dispensary, collect a payment from another and then, on his way back, visit a grower in Boulder to buy about 11 pounds of trim, the larger leaves that are stripped off the plants' flowers and are the raw material for concentrates. Behzadzadeh had agreed to pay $5,850 for the trim, and while Elsberg would collect at least that much in cash at his first two stops, he liked to separate the money coming in from the money going out. Elsberg walked into Behzadzadeh's office and over to the satchel, which is about the size of a small purse — Elsberg, who is 37, likes to call it Behzadzadeh's ""murse,"" for man purse — and removed six bundles of bills. He sat at the ornate wooden desk and on its inlaid-leather top began counting the bills in each thousand-dollar stack. Behzadzadeh, 50, was dressed in his customary uniform of brown leather vest and gray shirt, and he wore a silver Bluetooth headset like a necklace. As the men talked and laughed, a stack fell to the floor. ""One day, I brought in $6,000 from the safe from my store,"" Behzadzadeh reminisced. ""I put the money in the bag. The next day I was short a thousand dollars."" When the dispensary manager turned up nothing, Behzadzadeh grew alarmed. ""So Alex comes by to throw something in the garbage can, and there's a thousand dollars!"" They laughed heartily. ""If we had bank accounts,"" Behzadzadeh said, turning serious, ""it'd be much easier."" Growing and selling marijuana are, like using it, legal under Colorado law. But banks tend to take their cues from the federal government. Not only does selling marijuana violate federal law; handling the proceeds of any marijuana transaction is considered to be money laundering. Very few banks are willing to bear that risk. By the time Behzadzadeh took his Mexican beach vacation, he had already opened checking accounts for his businesses at Wells Fargo and Chase — and then saw them closed when the banks discovered what they were for. In most of the 22 states that, along with Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have legal marijuana markets, cash is not simply king; it is all-consuming. It is counted and recounted and stuffed into bulging envelopes, slid into back pockets and ferried around town in beaters and fully loaded S.U.V.s. Customers exchange it for marijuana at the counter; businesses use it to buy weed from wholesalers and for gardening supplies, plastic bottles and lab equipment. They use it for money orders at grocery stores. It pays employees and the rent and electric bills and taxes. It is fed into owners' personal bank accounts at A.T.M.s. On Jan. 1, California, which has permitted medical marijuana for decades, began allowing legal sales of recreational marijuana, creating a potential market many times the size of Colorado's, with the potential for many more banking headaches. But for Behzadzadeh, a solution lay in sight. In the fall of 2016, Elsberg and another employee, both veterans in the marijuana industry, put him in touch with Sundie Seefried, the chief executive of Partner Colorado, a credit union in Arvada, a Denver suburb. A division of the credit union, Safe Harbor Private Banking, provides checking accounts expressly for the marijuana industry, in clear violation of federal law. Partner Colorado was originally chartered in 1931 to serve postal workers; with about $350 million in assets, it still amounts to little more than a rounding error in the state's financial-services market. But in three years it has established itself, entirely through word of mouth, as the marijuana industry's biggest banker. These clients deposited $931 million in 2017. No other United States bank or credit union has probably taken as much, says Robert McVay, a Seattle-based lawyer who advises institutions on banking marijuana business. Most of those deposits are cash, taken off the streets and thereby reducing the latent, associated threat of robbery — a threat not just to those working in the industry but also to the ordinary people around them. As one banker put it to me, ""I don't want to stand in line next to a backpack filled with $30,000"" while someone fills out money orders. To manage these accounts, Seefried — working largely alone, in order to shield her colleagues from possible prosecution — created a sophisticated process to match deposits and withdrawals to marijuana transactions that are legal in the state. Seefried's bankers delve deeply into nearly every aspect of their clients' finances and operations. ""I said it in every interview in the beginning,"" Seefried told me. "" 'You have to understand: We're going to be the nosiest banker you ever had.' "" Five other small banks in the state also offer checking accounts to the industry and many more make occasional exceptions for companies owned by longtime customers, according to people who study and work in Colorado's marijuana industry. (They don't lend them money, though, because the federal authorities could seize whatever collateral backs a loan.) But it's difficult to say how many of these businesses have bank accounts in their own name, because most banks refuse to publicly discuss this line of business, and they require clients to sign agreements promising not to discuss the relationship. A similar situation exists in Washington State, where voters legalized buying and using recreational marijuana in 2012, when Colorado did. Seefried, by contrast, is happy to talk about it. ""Her openness to partner with me to teach stakeholders has been second to none,"" says Chris Myklebust, who oversaw Safe Harbor and every other financial institution chartered in Colorado as the state's banking-and-financial-services commissioner until he left the job in November. Seefried often accompanied Myklebust around the country to explain to state officials and bankers how marijuana banking works in Colorado. ""She understands the burden of being a financial institution serving the legal marijuana industry,"" he said. (She has also written a book, ""Navigating Safe Harbor,"" about it.) Seefried has managed to build a large and expanding portfolio of accounts that so far has withstood federal scrutiny. She hasn't been indicted, and she hasn't been told to stop. Seefried has concluded that, for the moment at least, her chances of facing prosecution are small — ""less than 20 percent,"" she says. Last spring, Behzadzadeh was gathering up dozens of business and financial records to send to her, and it was taking weeks. ""Sundie,"" he moaned one day after taking a call from his compliance officer, who was helping compile the paperwork. ""She wants my firstborn"" — and, he added, his left testicle. In the meantime, cash kept moving through the business. After returning from his rounds, Elsberg laid a pair of invoices on the table. Then he handed Behzadzadeh a No.10 envelope bulging with bills. Elsberg had already counted the money when he received it; now Behzadzadeh began counting it for himself, separating it into thousand-dollar stacks, before depositing them into the satchel. Then, having double-checked the totals, he entered each payment into his QuickBooks ledger and then into a Google spreadsheet that served as a cash log. The invoices are filed in case an inspector from the state's Marijuana Enforcement Division comes calling. Every dollar that comes into Behzadzadeh's companies is counted by Behzadzadeh or one of his employees at least three times before it goes out again. ""I've gotten to the routine where I need to put my own elastic bands around them,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""That way, I know I counted them."" Seefried imagined that these would be her golden years, time spent at her vacation house in Santa Fe painting desert flowers in the style of Georgia O'Keeffe. Seefried is just 56, but she was a credit-union veteran when she joined Partner Colorado in 1995; as its chief executive, she kept it profitable through the 2007 recession. In a stodgy industry, Seefried stands out, tall and even a little glamorous. In 2014, as her husband prepared to retire from another credit union, in Colorado Springs, she made plans to wind down her own career. Then one summer evening, while out for drinks, a group of lawyer friends confronted her with a question: Why couldn't their marijuana-industry clients get bank accounts? Seefried had in fact wondered about marijuana banking before. But, she said, ""nobody wanted to talk about it."" Now, buttonholed by her friends, she promised to investigate. She discovered that the conflict over marijuana — permitted by the state, prohibited by the United States — in Colorado and elsewhere has created a strange and uncertain legal landscape. ""It prevents either state law or federal law on marijuana from being effectively implemented,"" says John Walsh, who served as the United States attorney in Colorado from 2010 to 2016. Even Colorado officials who opposed legalizing marijuana — among them Gov. John Hickenlooper — support banking the proceeds, and not only because it reduces the prospect of robbery and violence. State laws carefully control, and heavily tax, marijuana distribution; regulators and law-enforcement officers investigating violators rely on the paper trails bank accounts leave behind. Banking, says Andrew Freedman, who for more than two years was the governor's director of marijuana coordination, ""is a really great redundant measure to make sure people are playing clean."" But that's not a view broadly shared by federal officials. Seefried says she was astonished last year when a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, speaking at a forum at the state Capitol, made the same slippery-slope argument against banking marijuana that is often made against smoking it: It would lead to banking cocaine, heroin and so on. Since Colorado's first medical-marijuana dispensaries opened their doors in 2009, the Department of Justice has seesawed between tolerating and prosecuting the nascent industry. National institutions like Wells Fargo, which had fished for clients at marijuana-industry conferences, were the first to abandon the field. Local banks followed, though a handful continued to serve some marijuana businesses discreetly. A game of cat and mouse ensued: Businesses would open an account under an innocuous-sounding name; after a few months of large cash deposits, the bank would investigate and close the account. When bankers noticed that currency from marijuana business reeked, enterprising owners began spraying it with Febreeze. In 2013, the Justice Department decided to focus on what it called ""the most-significant threats"" in marijuana trafficking. A memo from the deputy attorney general, James Cole, established eight priorities for federal law enforcement to investigate, such as a legal business as a front for other criminal activity, diverting marijuana to states where it remains illegal and selling marijuana to children. Yet around the same time, D.E.A. agents began showing up at bank offices in Colorado to remind executives that as far as the federal government was concerned, the whole industry remained illegal. The state bankers' association formally urged its members to avoid marijuana businesses. But to Seefried's great surprise, none of her state regulators did likewise. ""Everybody knew this money needed to be banked,"" she told me. ""They knew it."" In 2014, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network published guidance intending to clarify ""how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses."" To prevent money laundering, the Treasury Department, which protects the financial system from infiltration by illicit money, advised banks to know their customers. In this case, the government said, they had to satisfy themselves that clients weren't engaged in any of the prohibited activities in the Cole memo. And to comply with federal money-laundering law, they had to alert the department whenever money moved in and out of a marijuana business's account. The agency, in turn, makes those reports available to law enforcement. Most bankers did not take much comfort from the guidance, which could be retracted as easily as it was put forward, because read narrowly, it only explained how to report marijuana transactions to the government. It gave no assurance that banks would not face prosecution for money laundering. And not just money laundering: Partner Colorado's lawyer warned Seefried that the government could also charge her and the credit union's volunteer board with racketeering, a charge of criminal conspiracy that stiffens any penalties. ""All he kept saying to me during my research was, 'Sundie, there's no safe harbor.' "" The credit union's accountant advised her to read Piper Kerman's prison memoir, ""Orange Is the New Black."" Seefried, though, saw a way forward. Working off-hours at home with the blessing of Partner Colorado's board, she outlined the steps the credit union could take to demonstrate convincingly that marijuana-business clients were complying with the Cole memo. She named her vetting program Safe Harbor Private Banking. Forget the hippie colonies up in the mountains. The epicenter of Colorado marijuana production lies in Denver's north-side industrial district straddling I-70, where railroad spurs weave between warehouses, distribution centers and factories. Sharp-eyed visitors will quickly notice the signs of a cannabis facility: cameras over every entrance, hazmat signs and enormous HVAC systems. Avicenna and Green Sativa share a block with another licensed cultivation facility — a ""grow,"" in the crunchy slang that lingers from the underground days — and, according to Behzadzadeh's employees, possibly an unlicensed one, too. Avicenna is named for the Persian scholar who wrote ""The Canon of Medicine"" a thousand years ago. Behzadzadeh grew up in Iran, in a resolutely secular family; even as a boy, he couldn't stomach the fundamentalist clerics brought to power by the Iranian revolution. In 1983, when he was just 15, he left Iran by himself to join an older brother in the United States, arriving with almost no money. Behzadzadeh settled in Rhode Island, where he trained as a pharmacist. After seven years filling prescriptions, he found his way into software consulting and got rich before concluding that encroaching global consultancies would eventually swallow his business. At the time, Colorado was drafting the regulations governing the sale of recreational marijuana. ""I knew that this is a business of compliance before it's anything marijuana,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""I did not have a problem following the rules and regulations in pharmacy, so this would not be that difficult."" State and often local requirements govern every aspect of Colorado's marijuana trade to ensure safety and that no plant is grown or sold outside the licensed system, where it could evade taxation or end up in the hands of people not allowed to have it. Behzadzadeh led me to Avicenna's extraction room, where butane, under high pressure, is used to separate the psychoactive chemicals of cannabis from its leaves; Behzadzadeh, per Denver Fire Department regulations and at great expense, made the room blastproof. Next we stopped at the safe where he's obliged to store the drugs and any cash on hand at day's end. A few feet away, a young woman named Angel wielded a tool resembling a dental pick to pack small plastic vials with a sticky extract called wax, using a state-inspected scale, and a young man applied state-designed product labels onto state-mandated opaque plastic bottles. Other young men — apart from Angel, they were all men — supervised extracts baking in specialized ovens. In Behzadzadeh's office, we could watch all the activity in the building, including ourselves, watching all the activity, from 16 recorded camera feeds on a 50-inch monitor behind his desk. Another monitor over the couch displayed his dispensary 10 miles away in Federal Heights from four perspectives. But for all the regulatory rigor, the flux of cash requires adjustments on the fly that no business with a checkbook, let alone a line of credit, would have to face. That week, for example, Behzadzadeh hoped to parcel out his $22,000 payroll on Thursday. But the satchel was a little light. He had given a contractor $17,000 as a down payment on a new roof for his grow, which he was in the process of expanding. And a concentrates customer found itself short on cash, so Behzadzadeh agreed to split the product with the client and forgo a $7,000 payment. There was money in the safe at the dispensary, but nobody had time to go pick it up. So it was not until Friday morning that Elsberg walked into the office and pulled four thick envelopes from his jacket pocket containing $18,299.13: four days' worth of sales at the dispensary. Each envelope bore the day's total — the money had already been counted at the store, twice — but now Elsberg sat down at Behzadzadeh's big leather chair and pulled the cash out of an envelope. At one point, a loose note fluttered to the floor, blown by the ceiling fan. When Behzadzadeh finally sat down to disburse the payroll, it was after 5 p.m. He lugged a large vase full of change (the ""genie bottle"") over to the couch, retrieved from the satchel 22 thousand-dollar bundles, plus a big stack of small-denomination bills that he'd been collecting all week, and then laid it all on a cushion beside him. The first pay stub showed $932.81. Behzadzadeh took a thousand-dollar stack, peeled off a $100, which went into a new pile, and collected $32 from the small-bill stack. Then he reached into the genie bottle to retrieve the change, folded the stub and put it in an envelope with the cash. Walking out into the Friday twilight, very few of Behzadzadeh's employees probably gave much thought to the wad of cash in their pockets. But everyone in the business can recall one or another infamous crime — clerks forced to open a safe at gunpoint in a dispensary on East Colfax; the murder of a security guard in Aurora — and some spectacular heists have gone largely unreported, as when thieves broke through the roof of one grow and then cut open its safe. For these businesses, robbery poses an existential threat. The money is often gone — insurance to reimburse the loss is, naturally, expensive — replaced, potentially, by new costs for tighter security or tougher regulations or, in the case of a store, by damage to its veneer of safety. All of Behzadzadeh's cameras at Avicenna couldn't have protected his satchel from intruders with guns. ""It would only take one really effective rip-off gang,"" Walsh, the former U.S. attorney, says, ""to terrorize that industry."" Applying for a Safe Harbor checking account is an invasive procedure. The credit union first tries to learn as much as it can about the company and its owners, beginning with an hourlong interview, followed by the document collection that Behzadzadeh found so aggravating: lists of owners, investors, vendors and customers; financial statements and tax forms; the business's organizing documents; state licenses; leases, handbooks and more. The documents can multiply quickly, because marijuana businesses are often a web of affiliated companies with overlapping ownership. Each often gets its own bank account. Once the accounts are opened, Safe Harbor's bankers inspect the business and its premises as frequently as every three months, to confirm that it hews to all of Colorado's rules. Treasury's guidance implies that a bank can't properly make sure that a client stays on the right side of the Cole memo without a rigorous state licensing and regulatory plan in place, according to McVay, the Seattle lawyer. This, he says, explains why California's large medical-marijuana sector mostly lacks access to banking services: Local governments oversee the business, and with a very light touch. The state won't implement comprehensive regulations until later this year at the earliest. Safe Harbor bankers spend most of their time monitoring client transactions, tying every dollar the bank takes in to a legitimate sale and making sure that no dollar withdrawn disappears into the illicit economy. Each month, they reconcile the account activity to a company's ledger and the sales it reports, as well as to all the other information they've gleaned about a client, such as which companies it normally trades with. The credit union has compiled reams of data about how money moves around the marijuana industry, and bankers regularly compare notes about the transactions they see. When an unusual deposit arrives — larger than typical, say, or from a new source — the banker holds the money until the client can account for it. Seefried recalls how a banker noticed that one dispensary seemed to have customers with unusually deep pockets: its sales averaged $300 to $400 each, while medical-marijuana patients generally spend less than $100 at dispensaries. The banker interrogated the client and, from the parking lot, even staked out the dispensary and studied its customers. In the end, still mystified by how the dispensary made its money, Safe Harbor closed the account. ""You cannot bank what you don't understand,"" Seefried says. Safe Harbor has closed three other accounts after members broke various credit-union rules, indicating that they weren't willing to be fully transparent with their bankers. Late last summer, Seefried ejected three more members after bankers, working with money-laundering experts, detected suspicious activity. And another three closed their accounts rather than comply with her increasingly strict requirements, including one that customers deposit 90 percent of their receipts. The rule, she acknowledges, was mainly intended to weed out less-committed clients: Only a business trying to hide its transactions would be put off by it. Last June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado's federal regulator, conducted its annual examination of the credit union's books and practices, and for the third year in a row, had no complaints about Safe Harbor. Today the program consists of 13 people, including five responsible solely for compliance. Most are women. (Women manage more than half of all credit unions.) When Seefried hires bankers for Partner Colorado, she gravitates toward sociable people. For Safe Harbor, she says she prefers introverts or, at the very least, people who evince precision and curiosity. This sort of meticulous banking isn't cheap. For each $100,000 deposited at Safe Harbor, a client pays $450 in fees in the first year and $300 thereafter. (Client companies that serve the marijuana industry but don't actually sell the drugs, like laboratories, require much less vetting and so pay much lower fees.) Seefried says the Safe Harbor program made a modest profit in its first year — less than $200,000. It became much more lucrative for the credit union in 2016, but Seefried won't reveal specifics. According to federal data, most of the institution's sources of income have stayed relatively steady since 2014, but fee income has grown to a projected $5 million in 2017 from nearly $3 million. Seefried says that about three-quarters of Safe Harbor's marijuana-selling clients pay less than $1,000 a month per account, considerably less than they would pay at banks, where monthly account fees are said to start at $1,500. Many observers assume that the opportunity to assess lucrative fees is what entices small banks to take on these risky accounts. Federal data show that at Champion Bank, in suburban Denver, which began explicitly working with marijuana businesses in 2014, annual fee revenue on deposit accounts increased by a factor of 68 from 2013 to 2016, to $752,000 from $11,000, even as its main line of business, providing loans, shrank. At Colorado Bank and Trust in La Junta, fees grew elevenfold to $2.9 million. For marijuana businesses, engaging with the financial mainstream has kept them mostly free from legal trouble. Safe Harbor has received subpoenas for the bank records of only four of the just over 200 clients it has had. None has yet been indicted. John Walsh can recall prosecuting one case against regulated dispensaries and none against a business serving the industry. But working without a checking account makes even an otherwise law-abiding business look evasive, says Lewis Koski, who served as the first director of the state's Marijuana Enforcement Division, which collects marijuana taxes and regulates the industry, before he joined Andrew Freedman in a consulting venture. A cash-management technique like personal deposits structured to evade notice can legally amount to money laundering. ""Banking,"" Koski says, ""just provides a really clear picture of where money is coming in and where money is going out."" On the last Wednesday of last March, Kim Oliver, Partner Colorado's executive vice president, pulled her old, mud-streaked silver Jetta into Avicenna's parking lot. She had come from her ranch, east of Denver. She was dressed formally and seemed intently focused on the business at hand. Seefried had reviewed all of Behzadzadeh's paperwork; now only an inspection stood between him and a bank account. Behzadzadeh gave Oliver a warm welcome, and Elsberg took her ID, signed her in and gave her a visitor badge. Oliver made a mental note: the first small compliance test, passed. Oliver, who is 59, has worked in credit unions all her adult life. Earlier she had confided to me a lifelong hostility to marijuana and rage when she discovered that her son-in-law, a veteran suffering from PTSD and living in her house, was cultivating a small crop in her basement. But working on Safe Harbor had forced her to reconsider her views on medical marijuana. ""I found out that he wasn't blowing smoke,"" she told me. (I couldn't tell if she intended the pun.) ""That was my whole thing: You're just trying to have an excuse to smoke dope."" She now supplies her arthritic mother with topical creams that contain cannabidiol, a chemical compound in the marijuana flower that doesn't produce a high but that medical-marijuana advocates believe reduces inflammation. Oliver sat down with Behzadzadeh and Elsberg at a gray marble table in the kitchenette just inside the employee entrance. She began the formal inspection by going through a checklist: six pages long, scores of questions. The first series delved into Behzadzadeh's financial practices and the second into business procedures. These were meant to assess Behzadzadeh's compliance with state regulations. Then she read five or six questions about each of the eight Cole memo priorities. After a response, Oliver made a check — almost always ""yes"" — and sometimes wrote a little note beside it. ""If you had an employee, and they cut a bud off,"" she asked at one point, ""how would you catch who did that?"" ""Cut a bud off"" — the phrase in Oliver's Great Plains twang was disorienting. One of the incongruities in Colorado's marijuana business is how professionals new to the trade adopt the Mendocino idiom without either irony or any particular reverence, the way their clothes absorb the plant's scent after a few hours on site. The industry's brand-builders prefer more sanitized language when talking to the public: ""adult use"" for ""recreational"" and ""cannabis"" for ""marijuana."" Elsberg replied, ""That's the beauty of it — we have cameras on everything."" The questions, and especially the answers, occasionally delved into minutiae, as when Behzadzadeh noted that he had hired a man to drive the perimeter of his two buildings hourly every night. Oliver raised an eyebrow. ""He's legal,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""I checked his sosh"" — Social Security number. ""I checked his driver's license."" He deadpanned, ""I sent a copy to Jeff Sessions, too."" Next, Oliver went about documenting compliance, snapping photos of the cameras, the safes, the locks on cabinets and other equipment, the bars blocking the windows and even the eyewash station. She walked over to a bakery-bun rack and photographed the RFID tag lying next to a brittle sheet of an extract known as shatter. Then she had an employee type the tag number into the state record system to call up that batch's history. She visited the grow next door (""I'm surprised they have as many cameras that they do,"" she remarked approvingly afterward) and then followed Behzadzadeh and Elsberg up to the dispensary in Federal Heights. The dispensary inspection got off to a rocky start when Oliver noticed the A.T.M. near the entrance. Cash-machine companies often rent them to dispensaries and stores, because so few can accept credit cards, but Behzadzadeh owned his and each week filled it with $2,000 in cash taken from the register. ""That's got to change,"" Oliver said matter-of-factly. ""The biggest way of laundering money is through the A.T.M."" Behzadzadeh's machine was tied to a personal bank account; every time a customer withdrew cash, that account received a credit. But the register money was unaccounted for; it could come from anywhere. Now, Oliver told him, he would have to withdraw money from Safe Harbor and hire an armored car to deliver the cash and fill the A.T.M.; he couldn't even touch it himself. A look of incredulity crossed Behzadzadeh's face. ""Wait — I'm not going to give my business to somebody else!"" he said. As a start-up entrepreneur, Behzadzadeh nursed a swelling grudge against the contractors and vendors who nickeled and dimed him, he thought, at every turn — maybe even Safe Harbor. The cost of banking was one thing, but the prospect of trading the satchel for an armored car from a company like Blue Line, another niche player that charged a premium in a niche industry, especially galled him. ""I have no problem doing business with you guys, and I appreciate the banking, but I'm not going to pay Blue Line to take my money,"" he said, his voice rising. ""There's no way."" Oliver kept pressing. ""All they're doing is loading the machine for you,"" she said. ""If I wanted to be on the black market, I would come in here and fill this machine all the time to clean the money."" ""Ah,"" Behzadzadeh said. Now he understood. He thought out loud: He would bring cash from Avicenna to the dispensary and give it to a courier, who would put different cash, which he had brought with him, into the A.T.M. ""While you're doing that"" — Behzadzadeh addressed the imaginary courier — ""I'll make you coffee."" Behzadzadeh's dogs were barking ferociously when he and his wife returned home from dinner late one night in September. They didn't think anything of it, but several hours later, the couple heard noises in their house. Behzadzadeh gathered his wife and children in a bedroom and raced downstairs with a laser-sighted pistol. But the intruders were gone, along with his cellphone — and the satchel. The robbery could have been a financial disaster. A month earlier, the Denver Fire Department had determined that the extraction room at Avicenna was not sufficiently blastproof, shutting down the factory for two months. ""If they had taken $30,000 or $40,000,"" Behzadzadeh said, ""it would have literally broken my back."" But the satchel held no money that night. Behzadzadeh had opened his bank accounts the morning after the inspection. It had taken him a few months to fully embrace them — Seefried had predicted as much — but now around two-thirds of his trading partners also accept or write checks. What cash remains in Behzadzadeh's business waits in safes, secured to the floor, for the armored truck. Yet despite Safe Harbor's efforts and those of its competitors, bank accounts remain out of reach for many Colorado marijuana companies. The high fees put off smaller businesses at the same time as banks seem to be pulling back. Seefried didn't want Safe Harbor deposits to swamp the credit union, so last January she reduced the number of new monthly clients from five to three and then closed the door altogether in August after deposits ballooned over the summer. As the state Marijuana Enforcement Division granted licenses to about 220 additional companies last year through November, Safe Harbor's waiting list swelled to 96 businesses, or two-and-a-half-years' worth of new clients, before the credit union stopped adding names to it. The five banks have become very stingy about granting new accounts, according to three C.P.A.s who have marijuana-industry clients. The parent company of one of those institutions, Colorado National Bank, declared bankruptcy in November, putting its future as a marijuana banker in doubt. Marijuana banking has always depended entirely on forbearance from Washington, and the Trump administration seems decidedly less tolerant than its predecessor. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions declared before a gathering of law-enforcement officials that marijuana is ""only slightly less awful"" than heroin. ""I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store,"" he said. A task force assembled in February by the Justice Department to combat violent crime didn't recommend any changes to the Cole memo when it delivered its initial findings last summer, but the agency is very likely revising it. (The Justice Department wouldn't comment on its deliberations.) [Update: After this article went to press, the Justice Department rescinded the Cole memo, giving U.S. attorneys more latitude to enforce federal marijuana laws in their districts.] Seefried had hoped to begin making loans to and processing credit-card transactions for Safe Harbor's existing clients, but for the foreseeable future, she has put those plans on hold. Until federal law catches up to public sentiment, marijuana banking is unlikely to keep pace with the industry — the vetting is too expensive. Just last month, after a client was caught up in a police investigation, Safe Harbor had to review the account to make sure bankers hadn't missed any suspicious activity. ""It cost me $30,000: $20,000 to bring in investigators for three days and $10,000 for legal fees,"" Seefried told me. ""That's one client, with one problem."" She plans to raise fees in the next couple months. Yet she still hopes to position Safe Harbor as a model for banking the marijuana industry elsewhere. In November, Safe Harbor began licensing its name and protocols to financial institutions nationwide. Six banks and credit unions in six states will begin taking on customers this month, including a credit union in Colorado to serve the customers that Safe Harbor no longer can. Three more will join each quarter. Safe Harbor is also testing a mobile-phone app for buying marijuana in Hawaii's handful of state-licensed dispensaries. In June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado's regulator, advised Seefried that it would begin examining the institution quarterly rather than yearly, which she attributes to the national expansion. She has hired two full-time employees just to manage the increased compliance. ""We are bringing more credit unions to the table, and they don't want us teaching them incorrectly,"" she says. One industry investment facilitator, the Arcview Group, estimates that legal marijuana sales in the United States will more than double to roughly $21 billion by 2021 from nearly $9 billion last year. Walsh, the former prosecutor, has concluded that the tension between the federal government and liberalizing states is unsustainable. ""I came in as U.S. attorney in 2010 assuming that it was my job to enforce the federal marijuana laws regardless of what state legalization efforts would look like,"" he says. ""The longer I worked on the issue, and we struggled with it, the more I realized that a simple shut-it-down approach was not practical. The notion that you can put this genie back in the bottle today is not realistic."""
Interactive Feature,2018-01-04,"How the field is changing, and how it could help address a problem for men: The fastest-growing jobs are mostly done by women.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/04/upshot/male-nurses.html,0," The small burgundy satchel bore the hallmarks of rugged craftsmanship: top-grain leather, double stitching on the straps. It was wider at the bottom, sort of like an inverted funnel, and two buckles secured the flap. Babak Behzadzadeh knew exactly how he might use the bag when he saw it hanging in a shop in Playa del Carmen, Mexico: It could be his bank. Behzadzadeh owns two businesses in Denver. Avicenna Products makes potent marijuana concentrates. Next door, Green Sativa grows marijuana, which it sells directly through its own medical dispensary and store. By last spring, after just 18 months in operation, they were generating $250,000 to $350,000 in monthly sales, all of it in cash. During the workday, the satchel sat on a file cabinet in Behzadzadeh's small office at Avicenna, stuffed with tens of thousands of dollars that funded the two operations. One weekday afternoon last March, Avicenna's manager, Alex Elsberg, a bearish, bearded man with blue-tinted sunglasses perched on his crown, was prepared to drive a 100-mile circuit around Denver's north suburbs, where he would deliver concentrate to one dispensary, collect a payment from another and then, on his way back, visit a grower in Boulder to buy about 11 pounds of trim, the larger leaves that are stripped off the plants' flowers and are the raw material for concentrates. Behzadzadeh had agreed to pay $5,850 for the trim, and while Elsberg would collect at least that much in cash at his first two stops, he liked to separate the money coming in from the money going out. Elsberg walked into Behzadzadeh's office and over to the satchel, which is about the size of a small purse — Elsberg, who is 37, likes to call it Behzadzadeh's ""murse,"" for man purse — and removed six bundles of bills. He sat at the ornate wooden desk and on its inlaid-leather top began counting the bills in each thousand-dollar stack. Behzadzadeh, 50, was dressed in his customary uniform of brown leather vest and gray shirt, and he wore a silver Bluetooth headset like a necklace. As the men talked and laughed, a stack fell to the floor. ""One day, I brought in $6,000 from the safe from my store,"" Behzadzadeh reminisced. ""I put the money in the bag. The next day I was short a thousand dollars."" When the dispensary manager turned up nothing, Behzadzadeh grew alarmed. ""So Alex comes by to throw something in the garbage can, and there's a thousand dollars!"" They laughed heartily. ""If we had bank accounts,"" Behzadzadeh said, turning serious, ""it'd be much easier."" Growing and selling marijuana are, like using it, legal under Colorado law. But banks tend to take their cues from the federal government. Not only does selling marijuana violate federal law; handling the proceeds of any marijuana transaction is considered to be money laundering. Very few banks are willing to bear that risk. By the time Behzadzadeh took his Mexican beach vacation, he had already opened checking accounts for his businesses at Wells Fargo and Chase — and then saw them closed when the banks discovered what they were for. In most of the 22 states that, along with Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have legal marijuana markets, cash is not simply king; it is all-consuming. It is counted and recounted and stuffed into bulging envelopes, slid into back pockets and ferried around town in beaters and fully loaded S.U.V.s. Customers exchange it for marijuana at the counter; businesses use it to buy weed from wholesalers and for gardening supplies, plastic bottles and lab equipment. They use it for money orders at grocery stores. It pays employees and the rent and electric bills and taxes. It is fed into owners' personal bank accounts at A.T.M.s. On Jan. 1, California, which has permitted medical marijuana for decades, began allowing legal sales of recreational marijuana, creating a potential market many times the size of Colorado's, with the potential for many more banking headaches. But for Behzadzadeh, a solution lay in sight. In the fall of 2016, Elsberg and another employee, both veterans in the marijuana industry, put him in touch with Sundie Seefried, the chief executive of Partner Colorado, a credit union in Arvada, a Denver suburb. A division of the credit union, Safe Harbor Private Banking, provides checking accounts expressly for the marijuana industry, in clear violation of federal law. Partner Colorado was originally chartered in 1931 to serve postal workers; with about $350 million in assets, it still amounts to little more than a rounding error in the state's financial-services market. But in three years it has established itself, entirely through word of mouth, as the marijuana industry's biggest banker. These clients deposited $931 million in 2017. No other United States bank or credit union has probably taken as much, says Robert McVay, a Seattle-based lawyer who advises institutions on banking marijuana business. Most of those deposits are cash, taken off the streets and thereby reducing the latent, associated threat of robbery — a threat not just to those working in the industry but also to the ordinary people around them. As one banker put it to me, ""I don't want to stand in line next to a backpack filled with $30,000"" while someone fills out money orders. To manage these accounts, Seefried — working largely alone, in order to shield her colleagues from possible prosecution — created a sophisticated process to match deposits and withdrawals to marijuana transactions that are legal in the state. Seefried's bankers delve deeply into nearly every aspect of their clients' finances and operations. ""I said it in every interview in the beginning,"" Seefried told me. "" 'You have to understand: We're going to be the nosiest banker you ever had.' "" Five other small banks in the state also offer checking accounts to the industry and many more make occasional exceptions for companies owned by longtime customers, according to people who study and work in Colorado's marijuana industry. (They don't lend them money, though, because the federal authorities could seize whatever collateral backs a loan.) But it's difficult to say how many of these businesses have bank accounts in their own name, because most banks refuse to publicly discuss this line of business, and they require clients to sign agreements promising not to discuss the relationship. A similar situation exists in Washington State, where voters legalized buying and using recreational marijuana in 2012, when Colorado did. Seefried, by contrast, is happy to talk about it. ""Her openness to partner with me to teach stakeholders has been second to none,"" says Chris Myklebust, who oversaw Safe Harbor and every other financial institution chartered in Colorado as the state's banking-and-financial-services commissioner until he left the job in November. Seefried often accompanied Myklebust around the country to explain to state officials and bankers how marijuana banking works in Colorado. ""She understands the burden of being a financial institution serving the legal marijuana industry,"" he said. (She has also written a book, ""Navigating Safe Harbor,"" about it.) Seefried has managed to build a large and expanding portfolio of accounts that so far has withstood federal scrutiny. She hasn't been indicted, and she hasn't been told to stop. Seefried has concluded that, for the moment at least, her chances of facing prosecution are small — ""less than 20 percent,"" she says. Last spring, Behzadzadeh was gathering up dozens of business and financial records to send to her, and it was taking weeks. ""Sundie,"" he moaned one day after taking a call from his compliance officer, who was helping compile the paperwork. ""She wants my firstborn"" — and, he added, his left testicle. In the meantime, cash kept moving through the business. After returning from his rounds, Elsberg laid a pair of invoices on the table. Then he handed Behzadzadeh a No.10 envelope bulging with bills. Elsberg had already counted the money when he received it; now Behzadzadeh began counting it for himself, separating it into thousand-dollar stacks, before depositing them into the satchel. Then, having double-checked the totals, he entered each payment into his QuickBooks ledger and then into a Google spreadsheet that served as a cash log. The invoices are filed in case an inspector from the state's Marijuana Enforcement Division comes calling. Every dollar that comes into Behzadzadeh's companies is counted by Behzadzadeh or one of his employees at least three times before it goes out again. ""I've gotten to the routine where I need to put my own elastic bands around them,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""That way, I know I counted them."" Seefried imagined that these would be her golden years, time spent at her vacation house in Santa Fe painting desert flowers in the style of Georgia O'Keeffe. Seefried is just 56, but she was a credit-union veteran when she joined Partner Colorado in 1995; as its chief executive, she kept it profitable through the 2007 recession. In a stodgy industry, Seefried stands out, tall and even a little glamorous. In 2014, as her husband prepared to retire from another credit union, in Colorado Springs, she made plans to wind down her own career. Then one summer evening, while out for drinks, a group of lawyer friends confronted her with a question: Why couldn't their marijuana-industry clients get bank accounts? Seefried had in fact wondered about marijuana banking before. But, she said, ""nobody wanted to talk about it."" Now, buttonholed by her friends, she promised to investigate. She discovered that the conflict over marijuana — permitted by the state, prohibited by the United States — in Colorado and elsewhere has created a strange and uncertain legal landscape. ""It prevents either state law or federal law on marijuana from being effectively implemented,"" says John Walsh, who served as the United States attorney in Colorado from 2010 to 2016. Even Colorado officials who opposed legalizing marijuana — among them Gov. John Hickenlooper — support banking the proceeds, and not only because it reduces the prospect of robbery and violence. State laws carefully control, and heavily tax, marijuana distribution; regulators and law-enforcement officers investigating violators rely on the paper trails bank accounts leave behind. Banking, says Andrew Freedman, who for more than two years was the governor's director of marijuana coordination, ""is a really great redundant measure to make sure people are playing clean."" But that's not a view broadly shared by federal officials. Seefried says she was astonished last year when a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, speaking at a forum at the state Capitol, made the same slippery-slope argument against banking marijuana that is often made against smoking it: It would lead to banking cocaine, heroin and so on. Since Colorado's first medical-marijuana dispensaries opened their doors in 2009, the Department of Justice has seesawed between tolerating and prosecuting the nascent industry. National institutions like Wells Fargo, which had fished for clients at marijuana-industry conferences, were the first to abandon the field. Local banks followed, though a handful continued to serve some marijuana businesses discreetly. A game of cat and mouse ensued: Businesses would open an account under an innocuous-sounding name; after a few months of large cash deposits, the bank would investigate and close the account. When bankers noticed that currency from marijuana business reeked, enterprising owners began spraying it with Febreeze. In 2013, the Justice Department decided to focus on what it called ""the most-significant threats"" in marijuana trafficking. A memo from the deputy attorney general, James Cole, established eight priorities for federal law enforcement to investigate, such as a legal business as a front for other criminal activity, diverting marijuana to states where it remains illegal and selling marijuana to children. Yet around the same time, D.E.A. agents began showing up at bank offices in Colorado to remind executives that as far as the federal government was concerned, the whole industry remained illegal. The state bankers' association formally urged its members to avoid marijuana businesses. But to Seefried's great surprise, none of her state regulators did likewise. ""Everybody knew this money needed to be banked,"" she told me. ""They knew it."" In 2014, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network published guidance intending to clarify ""how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses."" To prevent money laundering, the Treasury Department, which protects the financial system from infiltration by illicit money, advised banks to know their customers. In this case, the government said, they had to satisfy themselves that clients weren't engaged in any of the prohibited activities in the Cole memo. And to comply with federal money-laundering law, they had to alert the department whenever money moved in and out of a marijuana business's account. The agency, in turn, makes those reports available to law enforcement. Most bankers did not take much comfort from the guidance, which could be retracted as easily as it was put forward, because read narrowly, it only explained how to report marijuana transactions to the government. It gave no assurance that banks would not face prosecution for money laundering. And not just money laundering: Partner Colorado's lawyer warned Seefried that the government could also charge her and the credit union's volunteer board with racketeering, a charge of criminal conspiracy that stiffens any penalties. ""All he kept saying to me during my research was, 'Sundie, there's no safe harbor.' "" The credit union's accountant advised her to read Piper Kerman's prison memoir, ""Orange Is the New Black."" Seefried, though, saw a way forward. Working off-hours at home with the blessing of Partner Colorado's board, she outlined the steps the credit union could take to demonstrate convincingly that marijuana-business clients were complying with the Cole memo. She named her vetting program Safe Harbor Private Banking. Forget the hippie colonies up in the mountains. The epicenter of Colorado marijuana production lies in Denver's north-side industrial district straddling I-70, where railroad spurs weave between warehouses, distribution centers and factories. Sharp-eyed visitors will quickly notice the signs of a cannabis facility: cameras over every entrance, hazmat signs and enormous HVAC systems. Avicenna and Green Sativa share a block with another licensed cultivation facility — a ""grow,"" in the crunchy slang that lingers from the underground days — and, according to Behzadzadeh's employees, possibly an unlicensed one, too. Avicenna is named for the Persian scholar who wrote ""The Canon of Medicine"" a thousand years ago. Behzadzadeh grew up in Iran, in a resolutely secular family; even as a boy, he couldn't stomach the fundamentalist clerics brought to power by the Iranian revolution. In 1983, when he was just 15, he left Iran by himself to join an older brother in the United States, arriving with almost no money. Behzadzadeh settled in Rhode Island, where he trained as a pharmacist. After seven years filling prescriptions, he found his way into software consulting and got rich before concluding that encroaching global consultancies would eventually swallow his business. At the time, Colorado was drafting the regulations governing the sale of recreational marijuana. ""I knew that this is a business of compliance before it's anything marijuana,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""I did not have a problem following the rules and regulations in pharmacy, so this would not be that difficult."" State and often local requirements govern every aspect of Colorado's marijuana trade to ensure safety and that no plant is grown or sold outside the licensed system, where it could evade taxation or end up in the hands of people not allowed to have it. Behzadzadeh led me to Avicenna's extraction room, where butane, under high pressure, is used to separate the psychoactive chemicals of cannabis from its leaves; Behzadzadeh, per Denver Fire Department regulations and at great expense, made the room blastproof. Next we stopped at the safe where he's obliged to store the drugs and any cash on hand at day's end. A few feet away, a young woman named Angel wielded a tool resembling a dental pick to pack small plastic vials with a sticky extract called wax, using a state-inspected scale, and a young man applied state-designed product labels onto state-mandated opaque plastic bottles. Other young men — apart from Angel, they were all men — supervised extracts baking in specialized ovens. In Behzadzadeh's office, we could watch all the activity in the building, including ourselves, watching all the activity, from 16 recorded camera feeds on a 50-inch monitor behind his desk. Another monitor over the couch displayed his dispensary 10 miles away in Federal Heights from four perspectives. But for all the regulatory rigor, the flux of cash requires adjustments on the fly that no business with a checkbook, let alone a line of credit, would have to face. That week, for example, Behzadzadeh hoped to parcel out his $22,000 payroll on Thursday. But the satchel was a little light. He had given a contractor $17,000 as a down payment on a new roof for his grow, which he was in the process of expanding. And a concentrates customer found itself short on cash, so Behzadzadeh agreed to split the product with the client and forgo a $7,000 payment. There was money in the safe at the dispensary, but nobody had time to go pick it up. So it was not until Friday morning that Elsberg walked into the office and pulled four thick envelopes from his jacket pocket containing $18,299.13: four days' worth of sales at the dispensary. Each envelope bore the day's total — the money had already been counted at the store, twice — but now Elsberg sat down at Behzadzadeh's big leather chair and pulled the cash out of an envelope. At one point, a loose note fluttered to the floor, blown by the ceiling fan. When Behzadzadeh finally sat down to disburse the payroll, it was after 5 p.m. He lugged a large vase full of change (the ""genie bottle"") over to the couch, retrieved from the satchel 22 thousand-dollar bundles, plus a big stack of small-denomination bills that he'd been collecting all week, and then laid it all on a cushion beside him. The first pay stub showed $932.81. Behzadzadeh took a thousand-dollar stack, peeled off a $100, which went into a new pile, and collected $32 from the small-bill stack. Then he reached into the genie bottle to retrieve the change, folded the stub and put it in an envelope with the cash. Walking out into the Friday twilight, very few of Behzadzadeh's employees probably gave much thought to the wad of cash in their pockets. But everyone in the business can recall one or another infamous crime — clerks forced to open a safe at gunpoint in a dispensary on East Colfax; the murder of a security guard in Aurora — and some spectacular heists have gone largely unreported, as when thieves broke through the roof of one grow and then cut open its safe. For these businesses, robbery poses an existential threat. The money is often gone — insurance to reimburse the loss is, naturally, expensive — replaced, potentially, by new costs for tighter security or tougher regulations or, in the case of a store, by damage to its veneer of safety. All of Behzadzadeh's cameras at Avicenna couldn't have protected his satchel from intruders with guns. ""It would only take one really effective rip-off gang,"" Walsh, the former U.S. attorney, says, ""to terrorize that industry."" Applying for a Safe Harbor checking account is an invasive procedure. The credit union first tries to learn as much as it can about the company and its owners, beginning with an hourlong interview, followed by the document collection that Behzadzadeh found so aggravating: lists of owners, investors, vendors and customers; financial statements and tax forms; the business's organizing documents; state licenses; leases, handbooks and more. The documents can multiply quickly, because marijuana businesses are often a web of affiliated companies with overlapping ownership. Each often gets its own bank account. Once the accounts are opened, Safe Harbor's bankers inspect the business and its premises as frequently as every three months, to confirm that it hews to all of Colorado's rules. Treasury's guidance implies that a bank can't properly make sure that a client stays on the right side of the Cole memo without a rigorous state licensing and regulatory plan in place, according to McVay, the Seattle lawyer. This, he says, explains why California's large medical-marijuana sector mostly lacks access to banking services: Local governments oversee the business, and with a very light touch. The state won't implement comprehensive regulations until later this year at the earliest. Safe Harbor bankers spend most of their time monitoring client transactions, tying every dollar the bank takes in to a legitimate sale and making sure that no dollar withdrawn disappears into the illicit economy. Each month, they reconcile the account activity to a company's ledger and the sales it reports, as well as to all the other information they've gleaned about a client, such as which companies it normally trades with. The credit union has compiled reams of data about how money moves around the marijuana industry, and bankers regularly compare notes about the transactions they see. When an unusual deposit arrives — larger than typical, say, or from a new source — the banker holds the money until the client can account for it. Seefried recalls how a banker noticed that one dispensary seemed to have customers with unusually deep pockets: its sales averaged $300 to $400 each, while medical-marijuana patients generally spend less than $100 at dispensaries. The banker interrogated the client and, from the parking lot, even staked out the dispensary and studied its customers. In the end, still mystified by how the dispensary made its money, Safe Harbor closed the account. ""You cannot bank what you don't understand,"" Seefried says. Safe Harbor has closed three other accounts after members broke various credit-union rules, indicating that they weren't willing to be fully transparent with their bankers. Late last summer, Seefried ejected three more members after bankers, working with money-laundering experts, detected suspicious activity. And another three closed their accounts rather than comply with her increasingly strict requirements, including one that customers deposit 90 percent of their receipts. The rule, she acknowledges, was mainly intended to weed out less-committed clients: Only a business trying to hide its transactions would be put off by it. Last June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado's federal regulator, conducted its annual examination of the credit union's books and practices, and for the third year in a row, had no complaints about Safe Harbor. Today the program consists of 13 people, including five responsible solely for compliance. Most are women. (Women manage more than half of all credit unions.) When Seefried hires bankers for Partner Colorado, she gravitates toward sociable people. For Safe Harbor, she says she prefers introverts or, at the very least, people who evince precision and curiosity. This sort of meticulous banking isn't cheap. For each $100,000 deposited at Safe Harbor, a client pays $450 in fees in the first year and $300 thereafter. (Client companies that serve the marijuana industry but don't actually sell the drugs, like laboratories, require much less vetting and so pay much lower fees.) Seefried says the Safe Harbor program made a modest profit in its first year — less than $200,000. It became much more lucrative for the credit union in 2016, but Seefried won't reveal specifics. According to federal data, most of the institution's sources of income have stayed relatively steady since 2014, but fee income has grown to a projected $5 million in 2017 from nearly $3 million. Seefried says that about three-quarters of Safe Harbor's marijuana-selling clients pay less than $1,000 a month per account, considerably less than they would pay at banks, where monthly account fees are said to start at $1,500. Many observers assume that the opportunity to assess lucrative fees is what entices small banks to take on these risky accounts. Federal data show that at Champion Bank, in suburban Denver, which began explicitly working with marijuana businesses in 2014, annual fee revenue on deposit accounts increased by a factor of 68 from 2013 to 2016, to $752,000 from $11,000, even as its main line of business, providing loans, shrank. At Colorado Bank and Trust in La Junta, fees grew elevenfold to $2.9 million. For marijuana businesses, engaging with the financial mainstream has kept them mostly free from legal trouble. Safe Harbor has received subpoenas for the bank records of only four of the just over 200 clients it has had. None has yet been indicted. John Walsh can recall prosecuting one case against regulated dispensaries and none against a business serving the industry. But working without a checking account makes even an otherwise law-abiding business look evasive, says Lewis Koski, who served as the first director of the state's Marijuana Enforcement Division, which collects marijuana taxes and regulates the industry, before he joined Andrew Freedman in a consulting venture. A cash-management technique like personal deposits structured to evade notice can legally amount to money laundering. ""Banking,"" Koski says, ""just provides a really clear picture of where money is coming in and where money is going out."" On the last Wednesday of last March, Kim Oliver, Partner Colorado's executive vice president, pulled her old, mud-streaked silver Jetta into Avicenna's parking lot. She had come from her ranch, east of Denver. She was dressed formally and seemed intently focused on the business at hand. Seefried had reviewed all of Behzadzadeh's paperwork; now only an inspection stood between him and a bank account. Behzadzadeh gave Oliver a warm welcome, and Elsberg took her ID, signed her in and gave her a visitor badge. Oliver made a mental note: the first small compliance test, passed. Oliver, who is 59, has worked in credit unions all her adult life. Earlier she had confided to me a lifelong hostility to marijuana and rage when she discovered that her son-in-law, a veteran suffering from PTSD and living in her house, was cultivating a small crop in her basement. But working on Safe Harbor had forced her to reconsider her views on medical marijuana. ""I found out that he wasn't blowing smoke,"" she told me. (I couldn't tell if she intended the pun.) ""That was my whole thing: You're just trying to have an excuse to smoke dope."" She now supplies her arthritic mother with topical creams that contain cannabidiol, a chemical compound in the marijuana flower that doesn't produce a high but that medical-marijuana advocates believe reduces inflammation. Oliver sat down with Behzadzadeh and Elsberg at a gray marble table in the kitchenette just inside the employee entrance. She began the formal inspection by going through a checklist: six pages long, scores of questions. The first series delved into Behzadzadeh's financial practices and the second into business procedures. These were meant to assess Behzadzadeh's compliance with state regulations. Then she read five or six questions about each of the eight Cole memo priorities. After a response, Oliver made a check — almost always ""yes"" — and sometimes wrote a little note beside it. ""If you had an employee, and they cut a bud off,"" she asked at one point, ""how would you catch who did that?"" ""Cut a bud off"" — the phrase in Oliver's Great Plains twang was disorienting. One of the incongruities in Colorado's marijuana business is how professionals new to the trade adopt the Mendocino idiom without either irony or any particular reverence, the way their clothes absorb the plant's scent after a few hours on site. The industry's brand-builders prefer more sanitized language when talking to the public: ""adult use"" for ""recreational"" and ""cannabis"" for ""marijuana."" Elsberg replied, ""That's the beauty of it — we have cameras on everything."" The questions, and especially the answers, occasionally delved into minutiae, as when Behzadzadeh noted that he had hired a man to drive the perimeter of his two buildings hourly every night. Oliver raised an eyebrow. ""He's legal,"" Behzadzadeh said. ""I checked his sosh"" — Social Security number. ""I checked his driver's license."" He deadpanned, ""I sent a copy to Jeff Sessions, too."" Next, Oliver went about documenting compliance, snapping photos of the cameras, the safes, the locks on cabinets and other equipment, the bars blocking the windows and even the eyewash station. She walked over to a bakery-bun rack and photographed the RFID tag lying next to a brittle sheet of an extract known as shatter. Then she had an employee type the tag number into the state record system to call up that batch's history. She visited the grow next door (""I'm surprised they have as many cameras that they do,"" she remarked approvingly afterward) and then followed Behzadzadeh and Elsberg up to the dispensary in Federal Heights. The dispensary inspection got off to a rocky start when Oliver noticed the A.T.M. near the entrance. Cash-machine companies often rent them to dispensaries and stores, because so few can accept credit cards, but Behzadzadeh owned his and each week filled it with $2,000 in cash taken from the register. ""That's got to change,"" Oliver said matter-of-factly. ""The biggest way of laundering money is through the A.T.M."" Behzadzadeh's machine was tied to a personal bank account; every time a customer withdrew cash, that account received a credit. But the register money was unaccounted for; it could come from anywhere. Now, Oliver told him, he would have to withdraw money from Safe Harbor and hire an armored car to deliver the cash and fill the A.T.M.; he couldn't even touch it himself. A look of incredulity crossed Behzadzadeh's face. ""Wait — I'm not going to give my business to somebody else!"" he said. As a start-up entrepreneur, Behzadzadeh nursed a swelling grudge against the contractors and vendors who nickeled and dimed him, he thought, at every turn — maybe even Safe Harbor. The cost of banking was one thing, but the prospect of trading the satchel for an armored car from a company like Blue Line, another niche player that charged a premium in a niche industry, especially galled him. ""I have no problem doing business with you guys, and I appreciate the banking, but I'm not going to pay Blue Line to take my money,"" he said, his voice rising. ""There's no way."" Oliver kept pressing. ""All they're doing is loading the machine for you,"" she said. ""If I wanted to be on the black market, I would come in here and fill this machine all the time to clean the money."" ""Ah,"" Behzadzadeh said. Now he understood. He thought out loud: He would bring cash from Avicenna to the dispensary and give it to a courier, who would put different cash, which he had brought with him, into the A.T.M. ""While you're doing that"" — Behzadzadeh addressed the imaginary courier — ""I'll make you coffee."" Behzadzadeh's dogs were barking ferociously when he and his wife returned home from dinner late one night in September. They didn't think anything of it, but several hours later, the couple heard noises in their house. Behzadzadeh gathered his wife and children in a bedroom and raced downstairs with a laser-sighted pistol. But the intruders were gone, along with his cellphone — and the satchel. The robbery could have been a financial disaster. A month earlier, the Denver Fire Department had determined that the extraction room at Avicenna was not sufficiently blastproof, shutting down the factory for two months. ""If they had taken $30,000 or $40,000,"" Behzadzadeh said, ""it would have literally broken my back."" But the satchel held no money that night. Behzadzadeh had opened his bank accounts the morning after the inspection. It had taken him a few months to fully embrace them — Seefried had predicted as much — but now around two-thirds of his trading partners also accept or write checks. What cash remains in Behzadzadeh's business waits in safes, secured to the floor, for the armored truck. Yet despite Safe Harbor's efforts and those of its competitors, bank accounts remain out of reach for many Colorado marijuana companies. The high fees put off smaller businesses at the same time as banks seem to be pulling back. Seefried didn't want Safe Harbor deposits to swamp the credit union, so last January she reduced the number of new monthly clients from five to three and then closed the door altogether in August after deposits ballooned over the summer. As the state Marijuana Enforcement Division granted licenses to about 220 additional companies last year through November, Safe Harbor's waiting list swelled to 96 businesses, or two-and-a-half-years' worth of new clients, before the credit union stopped adding names to it. The five banks have become very stingy about granting new accounts, according to three C.P.A.s who have marijuana-industry clients. The parent company of one of those institutions, Colorado National Bank, declared bankruptcy in November, putting its future as a marijuana banker in doubt. Marijuana banking has always depended entirely on forbearance from Washington, and the Trump administration seems decidedly less tolerant than its predecessor. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions declared before a gathering of law-enforcement officials that marijuana is ""only slightly less awful"" than heroin. ""I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store,"" he said. A task force assembled in February by the Justice Department to combat violent crime didn't recommend any changes to the Cole memo when it delivered its initial findings last summer, but the agency is very likely revising it. (The Justice Department wouldn't comment on its deliberations.) [Update: After this article went to press, the Justice Department rescinded the Cole memo, giving U.S. attorneys more latitude to enforce federal marijuana laws in their districts.] Seefried had hoped to begin making loans to and processing credit-card transactions for Safe Harbor's existing clients, but for the foreseeable future, she has put those plans on hold. Until federal law catches up to public sentiment, marijuana banking is unlikely to keep pace with the industry — the vetting is too expensive. Just last month, after a client was caught up in a police investigation, Safe Harbor had to review the account to make sure bankers hadn't missed any suspicious activity. ""It cost me $30,000: $20,000 to bring in investigators for three days and $10,000 for legal fees,"" Seefried told me. ""That's one client, with one problem."" She plans to raise fees in the next couple months. Yet she still hopes to position Safe Harbor as a model for banking the marijuana industry elsewhere. In November, Safe Harbor began licensing its name and protocols to financial institutions nationwide. Six banks and credit unions in six states will begin taking on customers this month, including a credit union in Colorado to serve the customers that Safe Harbor no longer can. Three more will join each quarter. Safe Harbor is also testing a mobile-phone app for buying marijuana in Hawaii's handful of state-licensed dispensaries. In June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado's regulator, advised Seefried that it would begin examining the institution quarterly rather than yearly, which she attributes to the national expansion. She has hired two full-time employees just to manage the increased compliance. ""We are bringing more credit unions to the table, and they don't want us teaching them incorrectly,"" she says. One industry investment facilitator, the Arcview Group, estimates that legal marijuana sales in the United States will more than double to roughly $21 billion by 2021 from nearly $9 billion last year. Walsh, the former prosecutor, has concluded that the tension between the federal government and liberalizing states is unsustainable. ""I came in as U.S. attorney in 2010 assuming that it was my job to enforce the federal marijuana laws regardless of what state legalization efforts would look like,"" he says. ""The longer I worked on the issue, and we struggled with it, the more I realized that a simple shut-it-down approach was not practical. The notion that you can put this genie back in the bottle today is not realistic."""
Op-Ed,2018-01-04,"As so many rock ’n’ roll stories do, the CBC Band’s began with the purchase of a guitar behind the back of a disapproving father.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/opinion/beatles-of-vietnam.html,1584," As so many rock 'n' roll stories do, the CBC Band's began with the purchase of a guitar behind the back of a disapproving father. When he was a young child in Vietnam, Tung Linh wanted a guitar, so his mother bought one for him. His father, Phan Van Pho, was a cook for French officials in Hanoi, and he wanted his children to become doctors or engineers, not musicians. When he found the guitar, he smashed it. But his wife, Hoang Thi Nga, nurtured Tung Linh's interest in American music, which he shared with two of his seven siblings: Bich Loan, a singer, and Tung Van on drums. When their father died in the late 1950s, Ms. Hoang went to work as a custodian on a Republic of Vietnam naval base. The family was poor, and those years were hard, but she wanted her children to be happy, so she nurtured their desire to perform American music. Ngoc Lan, an older brother who also played drums in South Vietnam's Navy band, noticed the talent of three of his younger siblings, and in 1963 he created a Vietnamese ""Partridge Family,"" before the American version existed. They were called the CBC Band, which stood for Con Ba Cu, ""Mother's Children."" It was a way to honor their mother for her unwavering support, Bich Loan said in a recent telephone interview. The children were so small when they started the band that no one could see the youngest, Tung Van, behind his drum set, even if he was standing. They had started with covers like ""You Are My Sunshine"" and Ray Charles's ""What I Say,"" just for fun. None of the children spoke English, so Ngoc Lan wrote the lyrics down phonetically in Vietnamese. From 1963 to 1965, the CBC Band performed in talent shows around Saigon. Then American troops began arriving in Vietnam in earnest, and their presence turned a hobby into a career. If the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival made stars of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Otis Redding, the escalation of America's troop presence in Vietnam did the same for the CBC Band. Ngoc Lan recognized a business opportunity in entertaining the large number of troops, and he reached out to local Vietnamese music promoters who contracted with the Army's Special Services Agency to book acts for officers' and enlisted men's clubs. A sister had performed with another band in Vung Tau, where music acts were in high demand because of the coastal city's status as an R & R spot for American servicemen. The CBC Band joined her there for several gigs, and she ended up joining the family band in 1969. By the early 1970s, the band was on the Army's approved entertainment list and made $325 a gig. The CBC Band traveled all over South Vietnam, wherever American troops were stationed. As the group played more gigs, they got tied in to the local rock and folk scene that included more established musicians like Khanh Ly, Trinh Cong Son and Elvis Phuong. Every Sunday, they would jam together, playing music inspired by American rock 'n' roll, ballads and folk songs. Word of the band spread through G.I. networks, and soon the demand for CBC Band shows grew so high that sometimes the band performed seven nights a week. Soldiers sought out Ngoc Lan and gave him tapes of rock 'n' roll songs they wanted the band to learn. Ray Charles and the Beatles were among the more popular requests that Bich Loan remembers. ""We would listen and copy them exactly like the record,"" said Bich Loan, who was in her early teens when the band began touring military bases. They played their own music, too, carefully crafted to sound like American rock, like ""Tien Yeu Tuyet Voi,"" or ""The Greatest Love."" Troops ate up those songs too. ""American soldiers loved us,"" Bich Loan said. ""They couldn't believe such young children could sing American music."" Troops showed their gratitude with money. The band members walked away from most gigs with more money in tips than what the clubs paid them. They gave all their earnings to their mother and, eventually, the CBC Band made enough to allow her to quit her job on the naval base. ""She had worked hard enough for us,"" Bich Loan said. It was war that brought the CBC Band success and financial security, but Bich Loan remembers that she and her brothers were too young to understand the complexities of the conflict. They wondered why Vietnamese were fighting each other, and why Americans had joined in, but that was the extent of their thoughts about it, she said. Everyone seemed to come together and enjoy the show when the CBC Band played, so why did they go off and fight afterward? Couldn't rock 'n' roll music stop a war? Perhaps not, but it could raise money for Vietnamese soldiers and war widows. In 1970, the CBC Band helped form Vietnam's first rock 'n' roll festival to raise money for military families. The Saigon government sanctioned the event, and Jo Marcel, a Vietnamese singer turned local nightclub owner and music producer whose given name was Vu Ngoc Tong, promoted it. In the end, the band was a casualty of war, too. Tung Linh received his draft notice in 1973, and he entered boot camp for six months of training. But his mother did what she could to help her son play music, which was what made him happy. She paid a handsome bribe to a high-ranking officer to secure her son's release from the army, arguing that she was old and needed him at home, and in any case, two older sons had already served in the navy. Yet normalcy proved elusive, as Tung Linh worried that he was constantly under police surveillance. When he drove his Honda to the market or around town and had to pass through security checkpoints, the guards always asked him why, given his young age, he wasn't in the army. Military officers began harassing Hoang Thi Nga because they suspected she had bought his release. Worried that the army might call for him again, his mother enlisted the help of some American and Canadian concert tour managers to organize a CBC Band world tour to get the band out of Vietnam. The promoters planned an 18-month tour, and the siblings figured they'd return home after it ended. Hoang Thi Nga cried when she said goodbye to her children. While the band was on the road, Saigon fell on April 30, 1975. Bich Loan and the other band members were asleep in Tibet when it happened; when they woke up and heard the news, they cried. They took refuge in a monastery and tried to figure out what to do. Their mother was still in Saigon. ""We thought we'd just be on a world tour for a year or so,"" Bich Loan said. ""We didn't think we'd never go back."" They were afraid to go back. There was a picture of the band members in downtown Saigon wearing American clothing and T-shirts with the American flag emblazoned on them. The new government branded the band members criminals and placed them on a most-wanted list because they had worked with Americans. The Phan siblings would later learn that their mother burned all their tapes and pictures of them with American troops, fearing retribution by the new government. They had been rock stars, but now they were refugees. In October 1975, the CBC Band entered the United States, thanks in part to a Vietnam veteran named Frank Ford, who worked in refugee resettlement after the fall of Saigon. Two or three years passed before band members could reach family in Vietnam. In the meantime, the band had hooked up with American and Canadian concert promoters and booked some shows. After a concert in Montreal, a friend helped them call Vietnam. Over the next two decades, band members became American citizens; sponsored relatives, including their mother, to relocate to the United States; and returned to Vietnam to perform. They still do, giving charity shows after which they donate all concert earnings to orphanages, nursing homes and other places that serve the poor. Young Vietnamese, for whom 1975 is a foreign world, are interested in the CBC Band and other singers and musicians from the era, Bich Loan said. It reflects a broader curiosity among the young about the history of South Vietnam, especially the people and the stories that the government has erased from official histories. The CBC Band has a following in the United States, too. Bich Loan and the other members who remained in America live in Houston, and the band performs for the city's large Vietnamese-American community. Ngoc Lan, who founded the band back in 1963, has moved back to Vietnam permanently. When Bich Loan reflects on the band's history, she feels grateful for Americans — for American music, for the American troops who supported the band and for Frank Ford the American vet who helped the band resettle in the United States. Yet the band members also lamented the war's destruction of Vietnamese life and land — a contradiction, like so much about the war was. Destroying a village in order to save it. Fighting while negotiating. Promises of liberation and freedom uttered by oppressive governments. Some Vietnamese kids brought joy to American G.I.s by performing rock concerts in the middle of a war that killed young people on all sides."
News,2018-01-04,Good Thursday. (We hope that all U.S.-based readers are staying warm.) Here’s what we’re watching:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/business/dealbook/trump-bannon-wolff-book.html,2945," Good Thursday. (We hope that all U.S.-based readers are staying warm.) Here's what we're watching: • Trump moves to open nearly all offshore waters to drilling. • Topic A in Washington is the lurid picture of the White House in Michael Wolff's new book. • A Justice Department decision on marijuana has whacked shares in one well-known publicly traded company. • Toshiba has found a buyer for its bankrupt nuclear power business. Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. The energy industry is likely cheering the Trump administration's decision to allow new offshore oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States waters. Many others aren't. From The New York Times: The plan would give the energy industry broad access to drilling rights in most parts of the outer continental shelf, including Pacific waters near California, Atlantic waters near Maine and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The proposal lifts a ban on drilling, imposed by President Barack Obama in his final days in office, that protected more than 100 million offshore acres along the Arctic and Eastern Seaboard. Such a reversal deals a serious blow to Mr. Obama's environmental legacy and signals that the Trump administration is nowhere near done unraveling the environmental restrictions of its predecessor in an effort to promote domestic energy production. The drilling plan comes on the heels of a separate proposal to repeal offshore drilling safety regulations that were put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster, as well as a decision by Congress to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. In a statement, National Ocean Industries Association president Randall Luthi said: ""NOIA welcomes the bold and broad offshore leasing proposal released today by the Department of the Interior."" The new plan will not immediately green-light drilling. Finalizing the plan could take as long as 18 months, the NYT reports, and in the meantime, a number of states are expected to challenge the proposal in an effort to protect their coastlines. This summer Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey sent a letter to the Interior Department, saying the state ""strongly opposes any waters off our coastline being considered for inclusion in this leasing program."" In 2016, New Jersey generated $44 billion from tourism, supporting more than 321,000 jobs, the letter said. Mr. Christie isn't the only governor to oppose the proposal. The Washington Post reports that ""the Democratic governors of North Carolina and Delaware are also opposed. Gov. Rick Scott (R) of Florida, where beach tourism on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts generates nearly $50 billion and a half-million jobs annually, according to a Florida Atlantic University report, said Thursday that he adamantly opposes drilling off the state's coast."" The WSJ reports that the studio could go for less than $500 million and shareholders may lose all their equity. According to the WSJ, ""the bidders include a group led by businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet; production company Killer Content working with philanthropist Abigail Disney; studio Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.; and investment firms Vine Alternative Investments and Shamrock Capital Investments."" Obviously, it's ""Fire and Fury,"" Michael Wolff's book on the White House. Why? Here's a sample of what Steve Bannon apparently told him, courtesy of the Guardian: Bannon, speaking to author Michael Wolff, warned that the investigation into alleged collusion with the Kremlin will focus on money laundering and predicted: ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" And here's an excerpt from CNBC, from what Mr. Wolff says was an email that circulated around the White House in April, purportedly representing the views of Gary Cohn: It's worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns. Trump won't read anything — not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers; nothing. He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored. And his staff is no better. How did Mr. Trump respond? In a statement yesterday, the president said that Mr. Bannon had ""lost his mind."" Lawyers for the president later sent his former adviser a cease-and-desist letter. Caveat: Some of Mr. Wolff's interviewees have accused him of misrepresenting them, in ""Fire and Fury"" and in the past. But Axios says he has tapes this time. The political flyaround • Paul Manafort sued Robert Mueller to limit the scope of the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in last year's presidential election. DealBook's White Collar Crime Prof doesn't rate his chances. (NYT) • Will 2018 be the year that Mr. Trump follows through on his hard-line trade stance and starts imposing tariffs? (NYT) • Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that New York State would challenge the new tax plan in court, and asked the state legislature to add a statewide payroll tax. (NYT) • Mr. Trump shut down a White House commission on voter fraud. (CNN) • The administration must decide on two policy choices this year that could batter the American solar industry. (WaPo) • Would Twitter ever suspend Mr. Trump's account? (NYT) The Dow Jones industrial average broke past 25,000 points for the first time Thursday. Yes, 1,000 point moves aren't what they used to be, but the pace of the rally is still notable. If the blue-chip index closes above 25,000, it will have taken the Dow just 23 trading sessions to go from 24,000 to 25,000. That would be the fastest move from one millennial marker to the next on record, writes the WSJ's Amrith Ramkumar. ""Of course, each 1,000-point milestone gets easier as the index marches higher. The climb from 24000 to 25000 was a 4.2% gain, compared to a 7.1% climb when the Dow hit 15000 in 2013."" A strong rally in technology shares has powered stocks in the new year. The Nasdaq Composite surpassed 7,000 on Tuesday, and both it and the Standard & Poor's 500 index are at record highs. In fact, this might be the best start to a year for the S.&P. 500, writes Instinet's Frank Cappelleri. ""The SPX has logged consecutive gains of least 50 basis points while notching 52-week new highs. That may not sound too outlandish, but according to SentimenTrader, this combination has never happened before. Thus, it equates to the BEST start ever…"" So can the bull market keep going? David Tepper of Appaloosa Management thinks so. Mr. Tepper said on CNBC: ""Explain to me where this market is rich? It's not rich with the tax thing that just changed earnings projections. With earnings forecasts going up and interest rates where they are, how is this market expensive? I don't see the overvaluation. World growth is higher."" We're believers that correlation does not necessarily prove cause causation, but ... maybe it has something to do with this, via the AP: Attorney General Jeff Sessions is rescinding the Obama-era policy that had paved the way for legalized marijuana to flourish in states across the country, two people with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press. Sessions will instead let federal prosecutors where pot is legal decide how aggressively to enforce federal marijuana law, the people said. As the AP notes, the move will make it more difficult for people to figure out whether it is legal to grow or consume marijuana. As for Scotts: The company has become a publicly traded proxy for the business of marijuana growing, with its C.E.O. having openly courted the pot industry. Political backlash: It's coming from Republicans as well. Take Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado: — Michael J. de la Merced A number of cannabis stocks tumbled on the news that Mr. Sessions is rescinding the Obama-era policy, reports MarketWatch's Ciara Linnane. Nevada-based Cannabis Sativa and Colorado-based cannabis farmer GrowGeneration are both down more than 20 percent. Even cannabis companies based in Canada, which is preparing to legalize marijuana later this year, are taking a hit. Toronto-based medical marijuana distributor Supreme Cannabis Co. and its Ontario-based rival Canopy Growth are both off more than 12 percent. Vancouver-based medical marijuana company Aurora Cannabis is down nearly 11 percent. The context: Shares of cannabis companies had rallied this week on the start of recreational marijuana sales in California. Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF, the largest marijuana-focused exchange-traded fund, ended Wednesday up 23 percent this year, after surging 74 percent in 2017. It's down nearly 9 percent Thursday. Toshiba agreed today to sell its Westinghouse Electric unit to Brookfield Business Partners for $4.6 billion, finally separating itself from its troubled nuclear division. The terms: Brookfield's offer comprises approximately $1 billion in equity, $3 billion in debt financing and the rest by assuming obligations like pensions and environmental charges. The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30, pending approval by the Delaware federal bankruptcy court. The context: Westinghouse's troubles — including delays and cost overruns at two U.S. nuclear plant projects — led to the business filing for bankruptcy last year. That has been one of the biggest drags on Toshiba, saddling the Japanese company with $6 billion in write-offs and the sale of its prized chip business to help keep the conglomerate afloat. Tara Lachapelle of Gadfly adds this as well: — Michael J. de la Merced As the music streaming giant moves toward a public market listing — it confidentially filed paperwork last month — Wall Street and Silicon Valley are waiting to see if other privately held tech giants also eschew the traditional I.P.O. process and just flip their shares onto a stock market. From Ben Sisario and Michael in the NYT: Deal makers and analysts have said a direct listing is available to Spotify because of its already wide name recognition among potential investors, which makes the standard I.P.O. meet-and-greets largely unnecessary. Uber, Airbnb and a few other giant start-ups also have readily recognizable brands and little need for the money raised in a standard I.P.O. process. If they follow suit, investment banks might stand to lose out on big fees — though it's worth noting that Spotify has retained several firms as advisers. Depends who you ask. Security experts say that both Meltdown (which affects virtually every Intel processor) and Spectre (which afflicts most other processors) have big costs. From Cade Metz and Nicole Perlroth of the NYT: The two problems could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of a computer. There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent — an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services. Companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft have started working on updates. And chip makers may have to eventually swap out all affected hardware. Investors have already shown concern about the effects: • Shares in Intel fell 3.4 percent yesterday. (The chip giant played down the problem.) • Shares in AMD jumped 5.2 percent. • Shares in Nvidia leapt 6.6 percent. Intel's chief executive, Brian Krzanich, sold off a large chunk of his stake in the company after the chip maker had been made aware of the security flaws. An Intel spokeswoman told MarketWatch the sale was unrelated to Meltdown and Spectre. The tech flyaround • Expect smarter cars and digital assistants this year, Brian Chen writes in his C.E.S. preview. (NYT) • Technology means 2018 will be more chaotic, as our interconnected world amplifies butterfly effects, Farhad Manjoo predicts. (NYT) The new law does away with corporate tax deductions for performance-based pay — like the huge stock-based packages C.E.O.s have enjoyed since the 1990s. Here's what Sarah Anderson of the social justice think tank Institute for Policy Studies told Renae Merle of the WaPo: ""We would like to think this would result for an overall decline in compensation that it could inject some rationality."" The dissenting view Skeptics think that the law will simply prompt companies to increase executives' base salaries. Let's use Ted Sarandos of Netflix as an example: 2017: $1 million salary, $9 million bonus target 2018: $12 million salary The tax flyaround • Bank of America Merrill Lynch thinks the new tax code will boost corporate profits this year, but create headwinds later. (NYT) • The overhaul includes help for craft breweries, but critics say that the biggest alcohol companies will enjoy the biggest benefit. (WaPo) Countries like Russia and Venezuela are drawn to the lack of central authority — particularly U.S. authority — inherent in Bitcoin and other digital money systems. But their own currency experiments may not work out quite as they hope, according to Nathaniel Popper, Oleg Matsnev and Ana Vanessa Herrero of the NYT: That's because Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are decentralized systems with no one in charge, while the Russian and Venezuelan plans would give the leaders of both countries a measure of control over the new currencies. That runs counter to some of the most basic concepts of virtual currency. Where Bitcoin is still a no-go zone: Merrill Lynch, which has blocked clients and financial advisers from investing in the currency or in related financial instruments. What people are missing about Bitcoin: Glenn Hutchins, the co-founder of Silver Lake, told the FT that while he has invested about $5 million from his family office on companies working with virtual currency, he has yet to buy a Bitcoin. ""Bitcoin could turn out to be the winner; it also could turn out to be Betamax,"" he said. Its shares fell 2 percent in after-hours trading yesterday. Here's why: In July, Elon Musk predicted that Tesla could build 20,000 Model 3s by December. In September, analysts projected that Tesla would deliver 15,900 Model 3s in the fourth quarter. Yesterday, with the analysts in FactSet's compilation of estimates still expecting 4,100 Model 3s in the quarter, Tesla announced that it had delivered 1,550. What Tesla says: ""During Q4, we made major progress addressing Model 3 production bottlenecks, with our production rate increasing significantly towards the end of the quarter."" What a critic says: ""The premise of the stock's sky-high valuation has long been of Tesla eventually dominating the auto industry. That notion has hardly ever seemed more fanciful,"" writes Charley Grant of Heard on the Street. The Times's chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott, discussed the year in Hollywood and Mr. Scott had a suggestion: The movie business might start by designating a pool of money — maybe equivalent to the value of the Miramax and Weinstein Company libraries, and the budgets of every Brett Ratner film and some fraction of Pixar's worldwide revenues — to fund movies written and directed by women. And Meryl Streep responded to comments about her lack of comments on the Weinstein accusations in an interview with Cara Buckley of the NYT: ""I don't want to hear about the silence of me. I want to hear about the silence of Melania Trump. I want to hear from her. She has so much that's valuable to say. And so does Ivanka. I want her to speak now."" • The White House named Geoffrey Berman, Rudy Giuliani's law partner, as the interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

News,2018-01-04,"SHANGHAI — China’s biggest online payment company offers its hundreds of millions of users a breakdown on their spending each year, showing everything from their environmental impact to their ranking among shoppers in their area. Many spenders — not shy, and occasionally even a bit boastful about their personal finances — in turn share the details on social media.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/business/china-alibaba-privacy.html,1290," SHANGHAI — China's biggest online payment company offers its hundreds of millions of users a breakdown on their spending each year, showing everything from their environmental impact to their ranking among shoppers in their area. Many spenders — not shy, and occasionally even a bit boastful about their personal finances — in turn share the details on social media. This year, the marketing stunt has run into a problem: China's growing sense of personal privacy. Ant Financial, an affiliate of the e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, apologized to users on Thursday after prompting an outcry by automatically enrolling in its social credit program those who wanted to see the breakdown. The program, called Sesame Credit, tracks personal relationships and behavior patterns to help determine lending decisions. That Sesame Credit program is part of a broader push in China to track how people go about their day, one that could feed into the Chinese government's ambitious — and, some people would say, Orwellian — effort to use technology to keep a closer watch on its citizens. The episode was a rare, public rebuttal of a prevailing trend in China. The country's largest internet companies, and the government itself, have gathered ever more data on internet users. While Chinese culture does not emphasize personal privacy and Chinese internet users have grown accustomed to surveillance and censorship, the anger represents a nascent, but growing, demand for increased privacy and data protections online. Fueled in part by widespread internet fraud and personal information theft, the call for privacy, if it continues, could become a major challenge to China's internet titans, and eventually to the cyber-authoritarian aspirations of the Chinese government itself. China has long had high levels of surveillance, from ubiquitous closed-circuit cameras in its big cities to the monitoring of much of its citizens' online communications. But such efforts have proliferated as new technologies like facial recognition have begun to be rolled out and artificial intelligence has made crunching vast amounts of data much easier. For now, it is far from clear that this rising discomfort will give way to policy changes. Many Chinese people, even as they express concerns about how companies use their data online, offer little criticism of Beijing's desire to use that data to help compile a broad social tracking system that rewards what it regards as good citizens and punishes others. Still, recent signs indicate Chinese consumers are beginning to express some of the same privacy concerns long found in the United States and elsewhere. This week, one of China's most visible business leaders bemoaned what he said was a lack of privacy in China in general, and specifically on the country's most widely used mobile chat service, WeChat. ""There's no privacy and information security these days,"" Li Shufu, the chairman of Geely Holding Group and Volvo Cars, said at a New Year's forum. ""When you walk on the road, there are surveillance cameras everywhere."" ""Pony Ma must be reading our WeChat messages every single day,"" he added, referring to the founder of Tencent, the Chinese internet giant that runs the social media and chat app, which has almost one billion users. In a statement, Tencent said that the company did not store the chat history of users and that it would never use chat history for big data analytics. The comments were met with widespread disbelief: WeChat users have been arrested over what they've said on the app, conversations have turned up as evidence in court proceedings, and activists have reported being followed based on WeChat conversations. ""It has become a default setting for me now to assume that we have no privacy in the face of Alibaba and Tencent,"" said Li Luyao, a college student in Beijing. Mr. Li said he did not believe Tencent's assurances that it was not storing chat logs, and he expressed anger at Ant Financial for resorting to what he called ""old tricks."" In its end-of-year feature, Ant Financial had customers click through a screen with a line in small font saying the user agreed to the terms of service, which were hidden. A toggle was on by default to indicate that the user agreed, and enrolled them in the Sesame Credit program. Ant Financial said in the terms of service that it reserved the right to share the data it collected with third parties — including government agencies assembling a state-sanctioned social credit system — and could not be held responsible for what happened after it shared the information. In its statement, Ant Financial said users should have had to actively change the toggle to indicate they agreed, and added that it would remove all of those who had been inadvertently added to the credit system. User complaints went beyond the narrow concern over how they joined, to broader questions regarding what they were asked to join. ""The tone of the agreement makes me feel so uncomfortable because every sentence literally goes, 'If this happens, we are not responsible, if that happens, we are not responsible,'"" said Zhou Yang, a 25-year old investment professional in Shanghai. ""They sound like sneaky unscrupulous merchants who will sell your data and don't want to be responsible for anything, and you have to agree to all of it."" Ms. Zhou's fears about data sales underscore more widespread worries about controlling personal information. China's official media have reported an increasing number of cases of internet fraud, and personal data is widely available for sale through online marketplaces. A 2017 survey by China's state-run Beijing Youth Daily found that leaking personal data was the No. 1 concern among consumers. The issue has filtered to the top of the Chinese leadership. Even as Beijing continues to assemble one of the most sophisticated and wide-scale surveillance systems in the world, politicians have called for better privacy protections. Laws have been beefed up to better protect consumer data. And it has had an impact overseas, too: Ant Financial's deal to buy MoneyGram, the money-transfer company, collapsed amid concerns in the United States over a Chinese company having access to a large amount of financial data. In part, the Sesame Credit moves by Ant Financial might have been trying to get around newer, stricter laws that would prevent them from sharing user data unless they had explicit permission, said Zhai Zhenyi, a lawyer at Yingke, a China-based law firm. ""Problems like telecom fraud and malicious marketing have severely vexed the general public, so people's consciousness about their rights is awakening,"" he said. ""This is a very good thing to see."" That consciousness may not extend to government collection of data, even though China's biggest internet companies often provide user information to Beijing. Ant Financial's credit system resembles one the government itself plans to soon implement. Beijing has said it will introduce in 2020 its own social credit system that is expected to give and take away privileges based on spending habits, online and real-world behavior, and social relationships. Foreign travel, speedy internet, school access, and social benefits could all be granted or denied based on a person's score. The government system will most likely be at least partly dependent on data collected by companies like Alibaba and Tencent. It is unclear how many Chinese are truly against such programs. Mr. Li, the Beijing college student, said that many of his friends still shared the shopping breakdowns — which now include a number indicating a user's Sesame Credit score. Such is the power and ubiquity of Alibaba and Tencent in China, he added, that customers would find voting with their feet and quitting the services difficult. ""Being angry doesn't do us any good,"" he said. ""Maybe you can stop using Alipay if you are angry, but there's no way you could stop using WeChat."""
News,2018-01-04,"WASHINGTON — The viability of the multibillion-dollar marijuana legalization movement was thrown into new doubt on Thursday when the Trump administration freed prosecutors to more aggressively enforce federal laws against the drug in states that have decriminalized its production and sale, most recently California.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/marijuana-legalization-justice-department-prosecutions.html,1505," WASHINGTON — The viability of the multibillion-dollar marijuana legalization movement was thrown into new doubt on Thursday when the Trump administration freed prosecutors to more aggressively enforce federal laws against the drug in states that have decriminalized its production and sale, most recently California. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, long a vocal opponent of the legalization of marijuana, rescinded an Obama-era policy that discouraged federal prosecutors in most cases from bringing charges wherever the drug is legal under state laws. ""It is the mission of the Department of Justice to enforce the laws of the United States, and the previous issuance of guidance undermines the rule of law,"" he said in a statement. In his memo to United States attorneys, he called the earlier policy ""unnecessary"" and pointed to federal laws that ""reflect Congress's determination that marijuana is a dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime."" Democrats and some Republicans condemned the move. Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, threatened to retaliate by holding up Justice Department appointments that required Senate approval. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor of California, vowed to encourage cooperation among states that have legalized marijuana. ""This brings states together around issues of freedom, individual liberty, states' rights,"" he said in an interview, ""all of the principles that transcend red and blue."" California began allowing the sale of recreational marijuana on Monday, joining Alaska, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Massachusetts and possibly Maine are expected to begin sales this year. In all, 29 states and the District of Columbia have at least partly legalized the substance — including for medicinal use — though it remains illegal under federal law. The move seemed certain to increase the confusion surrounding whether it is legal to sell, buy or possess marijuana in those parts of the United States where state and federal law conflict. Federal law has long prohibited those activities. In 2013, after voters in Colorado and Washington State voted to decriminalize marijuana for recreational use, the Justice Department deliberated about how to handle the resulting disconnect between state and federal law. Ultimately, federal prosecutors were instructed to deprioritize most marijuana-related prosecutions in those states. Justice Department officials would not say whether they intended to carry out a crackdown and begin prosecuting commercial growers, distributors and shopkeepers, or were instead merely trying to sow doubt and slow growth in the semilegal industry. The dissonance between federal laws that outlaw marijuana and a growing number of state laws that allow and regulate it make uncertainty a fact of life for marijuana businesses and consumers. They say they live constantly with shifting legal terrain, losing their bank accounts and lines of credit and never knowing how vulnerable they may be to losing their business or being federally prosecuted. ""It's a really scary time for us,"" said Jaime Lewis, whose Denver-based company, Mountain Medicine, sells marijuana-infused honey sticks, chocolates and cookie bites across Colorado. Ms. Lewis said that she emailed her 15 employees on Thursday to tell them that things were ""business as usual,"" and added that she still had access to her credit union and had no plans to close her business. Mr. Gardner accused Mr. Sessions of violating promises he had made not to interfere. ""With no prior notice to Congress, the Justice Department has trampled on the will of the voters in CO and other states,"" Mr. Gardner wrote on Twitter, adding: ""I am prepared to take all steps necessary, including holding DOJ nominees, until the Attorney General lives up to the commitment he made to me prior to his confirmation."" The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, maintained that President Trump was not going back on a campaign promise to refrain from using federal authority to shut down sales of recreational marijuana in states where they were legal. The Justice Department move, she said, ""simply gives prosecutors the tools to take on large-scale distributors and enforce federal law. The president's position hasn't changed, but he does strongly believe that we have to enforce federal law."" Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, a Democrat, said in an interview that she was still exploring her options, but that the net effect of Mr. Sessions's move was to ""rip the framework from underneath us."" Marijuana has become an important industry in Oregon, she said, with 19,000 new jobs, many in rural areas, and $100 million in state tax revenue over the past year and a half put toward schools, law enforcement and other programs. Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Democrat, said he doubted that the move would have much immediate effect on his state's legalized marijuana industry. He expressed skepticism that United States attorneys would want to siphon resources from other prosecutions so they could close a marijuana dispensary operating under state regulations. ""What are you going to cut back on: heroin enforcement or sex trafficking, to shut down a little marijuana shop?"" he asked in an interview. He said he hoped Congress would pass legislation giving individual states some federal latitude to write their own marijuana regulations, taxes and other programs when their voters did approve legalization. But during a conference call with reporters, Patrick J. Kennedy, a former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island who serves as an adviser to Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group against the legalization of the substance, praised the move as a boon to public health. Marijuana users should receive treatment, not go to jail, Mr. Kennedy said, adding that the country should not allow a new profit-driven commercial push for drug consumption akin to the liquor and tobacco industries. Mr. Sessions has put the industry on notice, said the group's president, Kevin Sabet, a prominent critic of legalized marijuana and former drug-control policy official in the Obama administration. Mr. Sabet referred to marijuana sellers as the ""new tobacco industry,"" and said the drug posed more harm to brain function and public health — particularly for younger users — than legalization advocates cared to discuss. ""All these people are going to wake up today with a bit of a heartache because they thought were scot-free, when in reality, they're not,"" he said. The federal government's hands-off approach under the Obama administration allowed a new industry to flourish. In Colorado, one of the first states to broadly legalize the drug for adult use, marijuana sales now top $1 billion each year and thousands of people work in the industry, in jobs like ""bud trimmers"" and marijuana tour guides for out-of-state visitors. Huge grow warehouses developed inside old industrial neighborhoods, and companies that produce marijuana-laced candies, infusions and drinks have large-scale production facilities — all of which may now have a bull's-eye on their backs. ""I do expect to see the larger investors and businesses targeted,"" said Mr. Sabet, who praised the step. ""I'm not sure whether local mom-and-pop marijuana shops will be affected."" Ramsey Hamide, an owner of Main Street Marijuana, one of Washington State's largest cannabis retailers, agreed that the move could have important financial implications. ""The immediate concern is how it is going to impact banking — that's a significant issue for the industry,"" he said. ""If the banks are feeling like they're not protected and that they have to pull our access to banking, it is going to really make things difficult with regards to payroll and how we transact with our vendors and our tax obligations monthly to the state for the excise taxes."" California's marijuana industry, by far the largest in the country, is still celebrating the debut on Monday of recreational marijuana sales. More than 100 dispensaries began selling marijuana across the state, and many more are expected to open in the coming weeks as San Francisco and Los Angeles begin issuing licenses. Henry G. Wykowski, a leading cannabis lawyer in San Francisco, said he had been inundated with questions from his clients on how they should defend themselves. ""We as an industry will aggressively defend our rights to engage in an activity that is authorized by state laws,"" he said. ""They have challenged us before,"" he said of federal authorities, ""and we stood up for our rights and we ultimately prevailed."" California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana more than two decades ago, and the industry is now entrenched. The state produces far more marijuana than it consumes; the surplus is sold illegally across state lines. Those interstate sales have been the prime target of law enforcement officials but have proved difficult to control. Nationwide, the marijuana market in states that authorize medical or recreational marijuana is estimated at around $6 billion and projected to grow to $9 billion by the end of the year, according to Marijuana Business Daily, a trade publication that conducts research. Chris Walsh, the editorial director of the publication, estimated that there were about 4,500 medical and recreational shops across the country. That number is projected to increase significantly this year as the rollout of licenses proceeds in California. ""They are not going to put this industry back in the bottle,"" Mr. Walsh said."
News,2018-01-04,"Each new year, about 100 freshly sworn-in New York State judges get robe fittings, courthouse assignments, chambers and staff members as they prepare to take the bench.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/nyregion/judges-new-york.html,1144," Each new year, about 100 freshly sworn-in New York State judges get robe fittings, courthouse assignments, chambers and staff members as they prepare to take the bench. But there is one thing these new jurists lack: judicial experience. So the state sends them to ""Judge School,"" a four-day judicial boot camp offered the first week in January to make judges out of lawyers accustomed to using their legal expertise to battle for clients. ""The transition is not something you can prepare for,"" said Christopher Robles, 44, one of 84 judges taking the program this week at the New York State Judicial Institute at Pace University's Law School in White Plains, N.Y. ""You go from advocating for one side, to becoming an impartial party who now has to apply the law equally,"" said Judge Robles, a former defense lawyer from Brooklyn newly assigned to Brooklyn Criminal Court. The goal is to equip the judges with the tools to quickly take control of their courtroom, said Judge Juanita Bing Newton, the dean of the judicial institute, a full-time training and education center for judges and other employees of the New York State Unified Court System. Still, as long as you ""never lose your humility,"" a judge can keep learning on the job, Chief Administrative Judge Lawrence Marks told attendees in opening remarks on Tuesday. ""Perfection is not the goal here — all judges make mistakes,"" he said. ""Judges get in trouble when they're arrogant."" The weeklong course has been offered for 30 years by the state court system, which employs 1,250 judges, and oversees another 2,400 town and village judges — who have their own training programs in Albany. The week in White Plains is packed with presentations mostly by senior state court judges. There are no robes or gavels, but all aspects are addressed in a broad curriculum that ranges from general ethics and courtroom conduct to narrow points of decision writing, search and seizure rules, domestic violence issues and orders of protection. Courses included ""The Black Robe,"" a general introductory class on Tuesday night, and a more detailed class called ""Facial Sufficiency of Accusatory Instruments,"" on Thursday morning. In his lecture on the ""Art of Judging,"" Michael V. Coccoma, a deputy chief administrative judge, welcomed the judges to ""this new life you have assumed."" Judge Coccoma warned against contracting ""black robe disease,"" in which the main symptom is delusions of loftiness. ""Oftentimes, judges get their black robes on and they think they walk on water,"" he said. ""They think they can do no wrong, and that everyone has to laugh at their jokes."" ""Remember,"" he said. ""No crown comes with that black robe."" What does come with it, he said, is courtrooms full of people standing up when the judge enters. It means their first names would largely be replaced by ""Judge,"" even outside the courtroom. Mostly it means always being under scrutiny. ""Largely, your reputation as a judge will be formed by your first year on the bench,"" Judge Coccoma said. His practical advice included getting to know the layout of courthouses and meeting its employees, from court officers to maintenance workers to administrators. Making an error in a ruling is to be expected, he said, and should be corrected quickly from the bench — ""Upon further consideration,"" was his recommended phrasing — to avoid reading about it in The New York Law Journal, or be reversed later on appeal. Judge Coccoma cautioned against conflicts of interest, accepting gifts or chatting casually — or even being seen — with lawyers arguing cases before them. With trial work comes emotional strain, he told them, but ""you got to wash it from your mind"" with healthy outlets like music, meditation, power naps, exercise — but not drugs or alcohol. A handful of the new state court judges had served as town or village court judges. David Alexander, 62, a former dairy farmer who became a lawyer, spent several years as a town justice in central New York before his recent swearing-in as a state judge in Cortland County. Mr. Alexander likened working as a lawyer to a competitive athlete playing for a team. As judges, he added, ""now we're the referees."" Another judge, Phaedra Perry, 51, will begin her judicial career by hearing arraignments in Bronx Criminal Court this month. Ms. Perry, an Air Force veteran who has worked as a lawyer, prosecutor and a court lawyer assisting a Queens civil court judge, called the training helpful because ""you have judges sitting and talking to you about their experiences."" During a lunchtime orientation on Tuesday, Judge Bing Newton said new judges should avoid holding people in contempt. ""Don't do it,"" she said. ""You are not in control of your courtroom if you have to hold people in contempt of court."" Judge Bing Newton went on to remind the new judges that making the transition to the bench required closing law practices, making financial disclosures, obtaining judicial parking permits (for officials use, not the theater) and hiring clerical staff, which ""doesn't mean that person is your slave."" To avoid making tabloid headlines, keep in mind, she said, that ""your behavior is more subject to criticism than your decisions."" ""Someone is always looking and you never know who it is,"" she said. An afternoon session began with a seminar on case management during which Deputy Chief Administrative Judge George J. Silver urged the judges to move their cases along quickly and to begin promptly each day at 9:30 a.m. If not, he said, ""The word will spread like wildfire that the judge is not on the bench till 10 because he or she is having a bagel and a schmear and a cup of coffee, so I don't have to worry about being there."" Any questions, he asked, adding with a laugh that, ""If you don't ask questions, we're going to reassign you."" Questions included how to work the computerized case-tracking system and even how to print out briefs to study over the weekend. In an another afternoon session, ""Evidence Essentials For Trial Judges,"" Michael J. Hutter, a professor at Albany Law School, gave the new judges an electronic quiz on whether certain types of evidence or testimony should be ruled admissible. Along with the questions, the judges' answers were displayed on a screen and there were often as many wrong answers as correct ones. And even Professor Hutter often offered the correct answer, appended by ""probably."" Clear-cut answers are not always available with nuanced points of law, he said, especially with little contextual information. Not to mention varying criteria for criminal, civil, family and other courts. This is where a judge's curiosity, wisdom and interpretive skills come in, he said. ""I now call as my next witness,"" he said to the class, moving on to the next quiz question for the new judges. ""What's your ruling?"""

His arsenic-laced prose was well known among powerful figures like Rupert Murdoch, whose life Mr. Wolff chronicled in a 2008 biography that left its subject displeased. But his nose for first-class gossip kept the machers circling. Now, the Wolff formula has been applied to a far bigger canvas: presidential politics. It is proving to be his most successful provocation to date. ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,"" his insider account of the year he spent reporting from the West Wing, has drawn denunciations from the White House lectern, threatened the career of the Breitbart News leader Stephen K. Bannon and turned Mr. Wolff, an overnight sensation at age 64, into one of the world's most famous journalists. On Thursday, Mr. Trump's lawyers threatened to sue Mr. Wolff's publisher, Henry Holt, if it did not halt the book's release and apologize for its contents — an extraordinary attempt by a sitting president to stifle critical coverage. Henry Holt responded by moving up the book's release by four days. Mr. Wolff may be looking at his first No. 1 best seller. Even for the brazenly confident Mr. Wolff, a status-mad needler with a habit of being ejected from expensive restaurants, this is a new level of notoriety. He is accustomed to angering the Manhattan power elite, not the leader of the free world. ""It's almost a natural evolution of Michael Wolff, that one day the president would be talking about him from the White House,"" said Janice Min, the former editor of The Hollywood Reporter, where Mr. Wolff is a columnist. His acidic portrayal of Mr. Trump as a president in over his head, disdained by aides who are astounded by his lack of fitness for the job, has dominated headlines and social media for days, along with his purportedly verbatim quotes from figures like Mr. Bannon and Mr. Murdoch dismissing Mr. Trump as a fool. But Mr. Wolff has picked up as many foes as fans during his years as a slashing columnist — perhaps more, even — and critics have raised questions about the veracity of his reporting, saying that he has a history of being casual with his facts. ""Historically, one of the problems with Wolff's omniscience is that while he may know all, he gets some of it wrong,"" David Carr, the late New York Times media columnist, wrote in 2008, reviewing a Wolff book that, he pointed out, contained errors. The excerpts from ""Fire and Fury"" that appeared this week have been raked over for mistakes. Mr. Wolff writes that CNN reported on Mr. Trump being accused of an exotic sexual practice with prostitutes in an intelligence dossier; in fact, BuzzFeed News reported those details. He also describes Mr. Trump as being unaware of the identity of John Boehner, the former Republican House speaker; in fact, the pair had golfed together long before Mr. Wolff began visiting the White House. Other details have been disputed. Thomas Barrack Jr., a close Trump friend, denied that he said the president was ""not only crazy, he's stupid,"" as Mr. Wolff reports. On Thursday, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the book contained ""mistake, after mistake, after mistake."" Mr. Wolff, who declined to be interviewed for this article, stands by his reporting. And his publisher is apparently undaunted by the president's threats. ""We see 'Fire and Fury' as an extraordinary contribution to our national discourse, and are proceeding with the publication of the book,"" Henry Holt said in a statement on Thursday. Mr. Bannon has not disputed his quotes in the book, even as the material has damaged him politically and perhaps professionally: Several Republican politicians have distanced themselves from him, and one of his key financial backers, the hedge fund heiress Rebekah Mercer, a funder of Breitbart, said on Thursday that she did not support his statements. Ms. Min wrote on Twitter that she attended a dinner party that Mr. Wolff describes in detail, including a verbatim conversation between Mr. Bannon and Roger Ailes, the now-deceased former chairman of Fox News. ""Every word I've seen from the book about it is absolutely accurate,"" Ms. Min wrote. In a telephone interview on Thursday, she added, ""People sometimes don't like what he says, but I think one of the things that's unnerving about Michael is he's loyal only to the story."" Of her own collaborations with Mr. Wolff, she added, ""nobody ever disputed the facts that were included on a piece."" Raised in the New Jersey suburbs, the son of an advertising executive (his father) and a newspaper reporter (his mother), Mr. Wolff entered journalism early, as a copy boy for The New York Times. (He would later skewer The Times, along with other mainstream news organizations, as stolid and biased.) He has been a columnist and a media executive, writing a memoir about his time running a failed internet start-up, and once trying to purchase New York magazine with partners including Harvey Weinstein. His friends say he relishes a scrap. Ms. Min recalled him grinning broadly after a party, telling her, ""Everywhere I turned was someone who hated me."" Sometimes, the spotlight has found Mr. Wolff, who became a running character on gossip websites and the city's tabloids. His personal life caused a minor scandal after a late-life divorce, amid a relationship with a writer about 30 years his junior. (He and the writer, Victoria Floethe, now have a 2-year-old daughter.) Mr. Wolff also became friendly with Mr. Trump, making a cameo in a pilot that never aired for a Trump-branded reality-TV project, ""Trump Town Girls,"" which involved beauty contestants selling real estate. After the election, he secured Mr. Trump's trust, in part, by relentlessly criticizing other reporters' coverage of the president-elect. Soon, Mr. Wolff was spending days at the Hay-Adams hotel in Washington, a block from the White House, where he was routinely spotted walking into the West Wing. He dined with Trump aides at the nearby Bombay Club. His book, he writes in an author's note, is based on about 200 interviews, including at least one conversation with the president. ""Many of the accounts of what has happened in the Trump White House are in conflict with one another; many, in Trumpian fashion, are baldly untrue,"" Mr. Wolff writes. ""Those conflicts, and that looseness with the truth, if not with reality itself, are an elemental thread of this book."" Graydon Carter, Mr. Wolff's former editor at Vanity Fair, wrote in an email that he was not surprised Mr. Wolff ""would write an entertaining book."" ""The mystery,"" Mr. Carter added, ""is why the White House allowed him in the door."""

Andrew M. Cuomo, the idea must seem like sweet payback for the pains inflicted on his state by the new federal tax plan: an elegant workaround whereby New York could replace its state income tax with a payroll tax and leave Washington, not Albany, on the hook for billions of dollars in lost revenue. But like so many white-paper plans, the proposal — while still in its larval stage — is already running headlong into a barrage of practical questions about how precisely such a switcheroo might work. ""The more you think about this,"" said E.J. McMahon, a conservative economist and founder of the Empire Center for Public Policy, ""the more it makes your head spin."" The basic premise of the governor's idea, suggested at Mr. Cuomo's annual State of the State address on Wednesday, is one also being mulled in other high-tax states bracing for the impact of the new tax plan's sharp curtailment in the deductibility of state, local and property taxes, which is expected to cost many residents in places like New York, New Jersey and California. One version of the plan would work like this: Eliminating the state income tax on wages would put more money in worker paychecks and mitigate the loss of full deductibility of such taxes on the federal level. That revenue would instead be raised by a statewide payroll tax, paid by employers, and still legally deductible on their federal taxes. The state would then make employers whole through a tax credit or some other mechanism. In theory, the only loser would be the federal treasury, which is already anticipated to take a colossal financial hit from the Republican-backed plan. Potential pitfalls were already filling up inboxes. Business groups wondered, for instance, if such a move might prompt the Republican-led Congress to return fire and eliminate payroll-tax deductibility. Economists said the complexity of the tax code made pushing through such a radical change quickly unrealistic. And tax experts puzzled at the possible real-world application of such a scheme, which might well involve asking millions of employees to accept cuts in their gross pay in order to offset gains in their net pay. Such questions were asked even before New York officials had divulged how their plan would work; the governor's office on Thursday reiterated that such an idea was being reviewed as part of a broader restructuring of the state's tax code, though a clearer picture would likely emerge when Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, unveiled his budget later this month. Gaining political support in Albany was hardly a sure thing: Democratic leaders in the Assembly were supportive of the payroll tax — ""It makes a lot of sense,"" said Carl E. Heastie, the Assembly speaker, on Wednesday — but Republicans in the Senate were more skeptical, even though some may warm to such ideas if constituents in their districts see their taxes increase under the new tax bill. Perhaps the biggest hurdle to Mr. Cuomo's proposal, some said, was the same reason it was attracting so much attention. ""It's never been done; it's never been tried,"" said Nicole Kaeding, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit think tank in Washington. ""It's an interesting thought experiment, but it's very different to put that into actual practice."" Ms. Kaeding said the idea of switching the state income tax for a payroll tax was one that until recently had lived only in academia — and even there, only for a few weeks, she said, as economists recently began discussing the implications of a switch and brainstorming responses. But even so, she said, the governor's proposal struck her as ""largely a political conversation."" ""It's very different to confront these actual policy questions and develop a workable solution,"" Ms. Kaeding said. Brian Galle, who teaches tax law at Georgetown University's law school, said that one knotty issue would be how to counterbalance the increased tax burden to employers. A state credit for employers could solve the problem, he said, but the federal government might seek to tax that credit, too. Another option would be to reduce the gross pay of employees, since they would no longer have to pay the state income tax, Mr. Galle said. Yet another alternative would be for the state to keep its income tax but also implement an additional payroll tax, the revenue from which would be funneled back to taxpayers as a credit or wage supplement. But those latter two options might run the risk of confusing New Yorkers seeing a short-term cut in their paychecks, even if they would eventually recoup the costs after filing their taxes, Mr. Galle said. ""They would see it as a pay cut,"" he said, adding that it could be a very difficult sell to taxpayers — and voters. Ms. Kaeding agreed: ""It would be very tough to explain to most individuals how this would actually work and why they would not be impacted,"" she said. Robert Mujica, the governor's budget director, disagreed. ""This would increase workers' take-home pay,"" he said. ""The current federal plan reduces their take-home pay by eliminating deductibility. Workers make more, not less."" One constituency whose reaction will be closely watched is the state's business community, which was cautious about the governor's proposal, citing the lack of details. ""At the moment, there's nothing to reject,"" said Kenneth J. Pokalsky, the vice president of Business Council, adding that his group was encouraged by the governor's general interest in restructuring the tax code. ""It's a necessary and important exercise to see how we match up state code with the reformed federal income tax,"" he said. ""And this may or may not be part of that evaluation."" Critics of Mr. Cuomo pounced on the proposal as a pipe dream for a governor who had fought the Republican tax plan. ""It's a desperate turn to a complex, untested policy,"" said Douglas Kellogg of Reclaim New York, a government advocacy group that has been backed by some prominent conservatives. But tax experts said swapping the income tax for payroll tax could actually face some of the stiffest opposition from traditionally left-leaning groups, a potential irony for Mr. Cuomo, who has characterized his opposition to the tax plan as a fight for progressive values in the face of a vengeful, conservative Washington. Negotiating lower gross salaries, for example, could be a difficult task in cities with long-term contracts for public sector workers and their unions, a potent and powerful political force in New York, particularly with Democrats like Mr. Cuomo. (Mr. Cuomo's promise on Wednesday to protect collective bargaining rights drew one of the loudest rounds of applause of his speech.) ""A pay cut would be a nonstarter in almost any conceivable universe,"" said Mr. McMahon. Eliminating the state income tax, Mr. Galle said, would also eliminate specific benefits written into the state income tax code. Gone would be the state income tax code's incentives for the renewable energy industry. Gone would be the incentives for charitable contributions, or for organ donations. And while Mr. Cuomo has railed against the impact of limits on state and property tax deductions on the middle-class, Ms. Kaeding said that eliminating the state income tax could favor high-income earners, as payroll taxes — such as the federal ones that pay for Social Security and Medicare — are generally flat rate. Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said the administration did not fear Congress yanking the payroll tax deduction if they proceeded with the idea, saying the federal tax plan showed them to be loyal to big-money companies. ""If they were willing to hurt the rich corporations, we wouldn't have the law we have that benefits them at the expense of the middle class,"" he said. Still, they conceded that many of the ideas for restructuring the tax code were still being worked out internally, including the renewable energy and other incentives mentioned by Mr. Galle."
News,2018-01-05,SAN FRANCISCO — The virtual currency boom has gotten so heated that it is throwing the list of the world’s richest people into disarray.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/technology/bitcoin-ripple.html,1295," SAN FRANCISCO — The virtual currency boom has gotten so heated that it is throwing the list of the world's richest people into disarray. Consider what has happened to the founders of an upstart virtual currency known as Ripple, which has seen its value skyrocket in recent weeks. At one point on Thursday, Chris Larsen, a Ripple co-founder who is also the largest holder of Ripple tokens, was worth more than $59 billion, according to figures from Forbes. That would have briefly vaulted Mr. Larsen ahead of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg into fifth place on the Forbes list of the world's richest people. Other top Ripple holders would have also zoomed up that list as the value of their tokens soared more than 100 percent during the last week — and more than 30,000 percent in the last year. The boom has turned Ripple into the second largest virtual currency, within striking distance of the original behemoth, Bitcoin. The explosion in Ripple's value over the past month is the starkest illustration yet of how the mania around Bitcoin has spilled over into a broader universe of virtual currencies. These coins — with names like Cardano, Stellar, and Iota — are generally new twists on the Bitcoin technology, which uses a decentralized network of volunteer computers to keep a record, known as a blockchain, of all transactions. While most of these currencies were worth nearly nothing a year ago, many are now responsible for creating billionaires — albeit with rapidly fluctuating fortunes. If this is a tulip fever, the fever has spread to chrysanthemums and poppies. Mr. Larsen's soaring wealth sparked a few congratulatory messages on Twitter on Thursday, even if the value of Ripple — and his Forbes ranking — dropped later in the day. But his net worth, and the ballooning value of Ripple tokens, mostly drew comments about the irrationality of the virtual currency markets, which appear to be largely driven these days by the fear of missing out, or FOMO. ""This is beyond insane,"" said Jeremy Gardner, an investor who previously worked at the virtual currency hedge fund Blockchain Capital, which invested in Ripple. ""There's absolutely nothing driving this rally except rampant FOMO, misinformation, and speculation."" Ripple, whose tokens are known as XRP, is far from the only virtual currency being fueled by the hysteria. In 2017, there were 29 tokens — including Einsteinium and Byteball — that rose more than Bitcoin's remarkable 1,600 percent jump, according to OnChainFx, a data provider. Nearly 40 virtual currencies are worth more than $1 billion — when all the outstanding tokens are counted at their current value — despite many of them not having been used in any sort of transaction other than speculative trading. Against this backdrop, Ripple could be considered a staid institution, though one with a colorful history. Ripple was invented in 2012 by Jed McCaleb, a programmer who had created Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange that later dissolved in disgrace. Mr. McCaleb designed Ripple as a faster and more efficient version of Bitcoin, without the mining process that Bitcoin uses to distribute new coins and secure the network. Mr. Larsen joined Mr. McCaleb early on to create a company, also known as Ripple. The company helped develop an open source Ripple software that makes it possible to move money between digital wallets. The Ripple token is one of the currencies that can be transferred with the software. Mr. McCaleb later left Ripple in an acrimonious divorce, though he retained a sizable number of Ripple tokens. His holdings were worth around $20 billion at Thursday's prices, putting him close to 40th on the Forbes list. (The actual list is only published once a year, and no big virtual currency holders have been officially added.) Mr. McCaleb has since created a competitor to Ripple, known as Stellar. Stellar has risen even faster than Ripple in recent weeks, with all outstanding Stellar tokens — known as Lumens — worth around $14 billion on Thursday, making it the seventh largest virtual currency. In contrast, all the outstanding Ripple tokens were worth $140 billion on Thursday, while all Bitcoin were worth $250 billion. Yet the fortunes of Mr. McCaleb and Mr. Larsen are not nearly as durable as those of other people on the Forbes list given that the value of virtual currencies fluctuates wildly. If Mr. Larsen wanted to access his wealth by selling Ripple tokens for dollars, it would likely drive down the value of Ripple tokens — and his riches. Mr. McCaleb and Mr. Larsen did not respond to questions about the recent price increases. Mr. Larsen was Ripple's chief executive from 2012 until he stepped down last year to become the company's executive chairman. During his tenure, Ripple focused on helping banks use its software to shift money between different foreign currencies, something that most banks currently do through a cumbersome process involving separate accounts in every country where they operate. Ripple has said it has signed up more than 100 banks to use the company's technology, including American Express and Banco Santander. But banks do not need to use Ripple tokens for Ripple's software to transfer dollars, euros and yen. That point appears to be lost on many small time investors who are buying Ripple tokens. Most of the buying and selling of Ripple tokens is happening in South Korea, according to data providers that track virtual currency exchanges, where ordinary investors have thrown money at a wide array of virtual currencies. Several virtual currency hedge fund investors said that they have talked to banks and heard about interest in Ripple's software, but not its tokens. ""I'm not aware of banks using or planning to use the XRP token at the scale of tens of billions of dollars necessary to support XRP's valuation,"" said Ari Paul, a co-founder of the hedge fund BlockTower Capital. Ripple has so far announced that one company, a Mexican money-transfer business, is planning to use the Ripple token. Brad Garlinghouse, who took over as Ripple's chief executive last year, said in an interview this week that other institutions are also using — or looking at using — XRP, but the company could not name them because of confidentiality agreements. Mr. Garlinghouse said he thought the rising value of Ripple tokens was justified, given the company's growth and the size of the foreign currency markets that Ripple wants to tackle. ""It's clear that people increasingly understand that we are solving a very large problem,"" he said. Ripple has attracted the ire of Bitcoin fans because Ripple has a greater degree of centralized authority in Mr. Garlinghouse's company, even though the Ripple software is open source. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies were designed to operate without companies or governments in charge. But the company Ripple, if not the XRP token, has won a following among top figures in government and finance who are interested in bringing the ideas introduced by Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. The company's board includes the former top financial regulator in New York state, Benjamin M. Lawsky, and Gene Sperling, who was the director of the National Economic Council under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Still, even virtual currency analysts who believe in Ripple's software have said there is a big difference between Ripple the company being successful, and Ripple the token gaining enough traction to justify current prices. ""An impossibly long list of things already needs to go right for XRP to become a reserve currency for banks,"" Ryan Selkis, a virtual currency analyst, wrote in a post on Thursday. But, Mr. Selkis added, that doesn't mean Ripple's price won't keep ascending. Why? ""Because this is crypto, and everyone in the industry is now slinging crack crypto cocaine to retail addicts,"" he wrote."

But given financial realities — a multimillion-dollar deficit that will not disappear by itself — the new policy, announced on Thursday, is as understandable as it is regrettable. For decades, the Met followed a pay-as-you-wish tradition, suggesting a $25 payment from every adult but not requiring it. If you wished to put up much less, so be it. In recent years, the share of museumgoers paying the full freight shrank as the suggested price rose to $25 from $12. In 2004, 63 percent of adults paid in full. In 2017, the figure shriveled to 17 percent. The system simply ""isn't successful anymore,"" said Daniel Weiss, the Met's president and chief executive. He said his institution is the only major museum anywhere that relies on voluntary fees and doesn't get most of its revenue from the government. So starting in March, non-New Yorkers will have to pay $25, though students and the elderly will be charged, respectively, $12 and $17. The only exceptions are students from Connecticut and New Jersey. Pay as you wish remains in place for them. The same goes for New Yorkers. In effect, they will be carded, forced to produce identification — a driver's license, a library card, a bank statement — that shows their address. The new system is in line with prices charged at some other institutions, like the Museum of Modern Art. It's not expected to produce torrents of new money for the Met, though. Mr. Weiss put the projected extra revenue from non-New Yorkers between $6 million and $11 million. New York City's government — which has given the new policy its blessing and contributes more than $27 million a year to help cover the museum's operating expenses — spends $6 million every 35 minutes or so. It's tempting to ask if the Met couldn't have found other sources without compelling some visitors to pry open their wallets. Indeed, some are already asking. Among those giving the change a thumbs-down are The Times's chief art critics, Holland Cotter and Roberta Smith. Still, one can sympathize with the museum, even if some of its financial woes are of its own creation across the years. Mr. Weiss calls the new revenue both ""meaningful"" and dependable. It's hard to imagine vast numbers of foreigners or out-of-staters, already paying sacks of cash to tour New York, refusing to set foot in the Met because $25 will now be demanded instead of requested. We're going to keep an eye out, though, for scam artists. Can't you just see enterprising souls hanging outside the Met and hawking fake New York IDs?"
News,2018-01-05,"LOS ANGELES — The reboot of the once-and-again Los Angeles Rams will get a huge lift on Saturday, when they host the Atlanta Falcons in the first round of the N.F.L. playoffs.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/sports/los-angeles-rams-playoffs-chargers.html,1640," LOS ANGELES — The reboot of the once-and-again Los Angeles Rams will get a huge lift on Saturday, when they host the Atlanta Falcons in the first round of the N.F.L. playoffs. Dave Stanley will be there, just as he was in 1986, the last time the Southern California version of this team hosted a home playoff game. ""I'm so ready for this,"" said Stanley, 57, a lifelong Angeleno who is part of a group of die-hard Rams fans who wear hollowed-out watermelons on their heads when they sit in a section at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum known as the Melon Patch. Melon-heads like Stanley experienced two decades of N.F.L. diaspora while their beloved Rams played in St. Louis from 1995-2015. The Rams returned to the Los Angeles region in 2016, then pulled off a stunning turnaround this season, winning 11 games, compared with four in 2016, a feat nearly matched by the newly rechristened Los Angeles Chargers, who relocated up the 405 from San Diego this season and almost made the playoffs. The teams' resurgences came at a critical time. Less than 10 miles from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Rams are building a $2.6 billion stadium and entertainment district in Inglewood that the Chargers will also call home. The stadium is now a vast construction site a few miles south of Los Angeles International Airport. The teams will soon begin asking their fans to spend thousands of dollars on personal seat licenses, the unpopular permits that are required before they can spend thousands of dollars more on season tickets. Convincing fans to spend hefty sums for seat licenses, season tickets, club seats, and nearly 300 luxury suites with price tags in the low-to-mid six figures, will be a far harder task than getting them to buy modestly priced tickets at the Coliseum or StubHub Center in Carson, where the Chargers play for now. With licenses for the best seats potentially costing more than $100,000, Stanley and thousands of other loyalists are nervous they won't be able to afford a seat in the new stadium. There are financial limits to his love for the Rams, fanatical as it may be. ""If they say, 10, 15 grand for a seat license, it'll be DirecTV, here I come,"" said Stanley, who works at hardwood specialty products company. The success of those sales campaigns will amount to a referendum not just on the Rams' and Chargers' popularity, but on the wisdom of the N.F.L.'s decision to let two teams move to Los Angeles. If the stadium is perceived as a pricey and exclusive luxury, the league's goal of reintegrating itself into the country's second largest market could sputter further. Attendance at Rams games fell 24 percent this year, as the novelty factor of their maiden 2016 season wore off. The number of households watching Rams games dipped six percent this season. The Chargers struggled to fill the 30,000-seat StubHub Center, a soccer stadium where Chargers fans were often outnumbered by fans of the visiting team. ""Everyone knows we're the new kids of the block,"" said Dean Spanos, the Chargers owner. ""We knew coming up here there wasn't going to be a red carpet rolled out for us. We have to earn our way in."" Still, on the field, things couldn't have gone much better the past few months. After the Rams' dismal first season back in Los Angeles, the precocious rookie head coach Sean McVay secured the Rams' first division title since 2003. Powered by quarterback Jared Goff and Todd Gurley II, an M.V.P.-caliber running back, the Rams became the first team in the Super Bowl era to have the highest scoring offense a year after having the lowest. The Chargers lost their first four games, then won nine of their last 12, fueled by the league's best passing game. If the team hadn't lost three games by a field goal or less, it might have squeezed into the playoffs. However the teams perform, N.F.L. officials say they are confident the city will embrace the league, even though the Rams and Raiders abandoned the region after the 1994 season. Many owners believe the market, with about 15 million residents, can support two teams. They say the N.F.L.'s flash and speed is a natural fit in the entertainment capital of the world. Kevin Demoff, the chief operating officer of the Rams, echoed this view and shrugged off the early hiccups. He blamed the decline of the team's television audience on competition. Certain games took place at the same time as Chargers games, or had to fight for eyeballs with the national game of the week. And while attendance fell, he said, the team is attracting a more devoted following, not just casual fans eager to say they attended a game. ""As you drive around the city, you see Rams car flags, and you know you've made it when you see car flags,"" Demoff said. He described reviving and building a new fan base as a long-term process. ""Like building the stadium, this is going to take years."" Winning helps. According to Fanatics, the largest online seller of N.F.L. gear, sales of Rams merchandise jumped 50 percent this season, the largest increase after the Eagles and Jaguars. Demoff insisted the new stadium, which won't open until 2020, will help define the team in Los Angeles, and befit a league that has grown into a $14 billion-a-year juggernaut. Its scale and scope suggest as much. The 300-acre city-within-a-city will be 3.5 times larger than Disneyland Park in Anaheim. During the 14 months since ground was broken on the site of the old Hollywood Park Racetrack, crews have moved more than six million cubic yards of dirt, enough to fill 600,000 dump trucks. More than 12,000 tons of steel have been erected, helping give shape to much of the lower bowl of the venue. Many of the columns that will support the roof that will cover the 70,000-seat stadium are now in place. The building is designed to create the buzz needed to attract attention in a city that craves it. The stadium will include 275 luxury suites and 16,000 club seats, and an oval two-sided video screen that will hang from the roof. The teams are banking on these and other attractions to create a must-see venue. ""People in this market want to go to see people and to be seen,"" said Amy Trask, who grew up in Los Angeles and worked for the Raiders for 29 years, including several years when they played here. ""If the Rams and Chargers can make their ticket a sexy ticket, it will insulate them in the down years."" Though the Rams and Chargers will share the stadium, and have their own locker rooms, the teams are, in many ways, not equals, Trask and others said. When they moved back from St. Louis, the Rams were greeted by fans like Stanley, who followed them during some of the 46 years they played in Southern California. The team also had the advantage of announcing their move first. Rams' owner, E. Stanley Kroenke, is financing the stadium. The Chargers, who will be Kroenke's tenant, arrived a year later, after they failed to persuade lawmakers in San Diego to help them build a new stadium there. The team has shallow roots in Los Angeles, having played here just one year as part of the old A.F.L. Spanos was encouraged by the team's strong finish, which helped lift merchandise sales and the team's following on social media. But many loyalists from San Diego have not followed the team north. One San Diego resident was so angry at the Chargers that he raised $22,000 online to help pay for a billboard near the StubHub Center to criticize the N.F.L. and team for abandoning San Diego. The fan, Joseph MacRae, has also rented planes that flew banners over the stadium on game day, something he plans to do again on Saturday before the Rams-Falcons game. ""The message I'm trying to get across is that the N.F.L. really messed this up,"" MacRae said. ""People in San Diego are never going to root for a team in Los Angeles. No fan deserves to lose their team."" For now, though, the focus is on the Rams. Though the team's offense was understandably lauded, the team's defense improved measurably under the new defensive coordinator, Wade Phillips, one of the great defensive minds of his generation. Phillips, who most recently created the Denver Broncos' buzz-saw defense that won the 2016 Super Bowl, is 70 years old, nearly four decades older than his 31-year-old boss McVay, who is known as an offensive whiz. Under Phillips, defensive tackle Aaron Donald has become a force of nature. Donald led the N.F.L. in forced fumbles, was tied for fourth in quarterback hits, and led all defensive tackles with 11 sacks. On offense, Gurley led the league with 2,093 yards from scrimmage and scored 19 total touchdowns. Goff also had a talented group of receivers to throw to, including rookie Cooper Kupp, but also Robert Woods and Sammy Watkins. The Rams had the best kick returner in Pharoh Cooper, the best punter in Johnny Hekker, and the best kicker, Greg Zuerlein, until he injured his back. And with one of the youngest rosters in the league, the Rams have the potential to succeed for years to come, something they will desperately need to win over a city with little appetite for the mediocre that is still getting to know the team. ""The opening of the new stadium will be a panacea for a while, and people will be focused on ribbon cutting and flyovers,"" said David Carter, the executive director of the Sports Business Institute at USC. ""But you better have the right high-octane product that captivates market. Around here, if you're not in, you're out."""

Unlike them, he already has a pedigree: he has shown his work alongside Mark Rothko, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell while they were still alive and in their prime. In 1958, a large Bertschmann canvas was featured in the Carnegie International exhibition in Pittsburgh, a rarefied achievement for any artist, let alone one in his mid-20s. Since then, Mr. Bertschmann has painted or drawn nearly every day of his adult life, producing a body of work that has been praised by some of the art world's foremost tastemakers. Yet he has remained virtually unknown. ""I had to make money,"" Mr. Bertschmann, 86, said one morning in late November as he sat at the dining table of his light-filled, art-filled apartment-studio near the South Street Seaport. And he did, working as a freelance graphic designer creating logos, packaging and advertising for brands like Pond's cold cream and Bufferin. His success at his day job ensured that he wasn't hungry, and while he has produced thousands (he has no idea how many thousands) of fine-art paintings, drawings and collages in wildly varied styles, he never persistently sought gallery representation. ""Harry's never been a salesman,"" said Mary Bertschmann, his wife of more than 50 years. ""He didn't get his art out there for them to see."" Nor did he carouse with his more exhibitionistic contemporaries at Cedar Tavern, participate in splashy happenings or attract art-world gossip. ""Also, we had started our own small press, and Harry was doing great designs for Harper & Row, like this wonderful thing,"" she said, pointing to a fetchingly illustrated poetry anthology published in the 1970s. "" We were so into our world, plus, of course, with a child."" Over the years there were some exhibitions and acquisitions, notably a 140-work retrospective in 1997 of both his commercial and fine art in Basel, Switzerland, where Mr. Bertschmann was born and raised. But these accomplishments never amounted to a self-sustaining fine art career. As he reached his 80s, humility and obscurity started getting old, and costly. Now the Bertschmanns find themselves in a tenuous financial position. Mr. Bertschmann no longer does much graphic design, and Mrs. Bertschmann recently retired as the executive director of the Huguenot Society of America. She said that they have been ""suffering financially."" Despite living in a lofty one-bedroom apartment near the South Street Seaport, they are retired renters who will not benefit from the gentrification of the neighborhood. On the bright side, she added, a man named Peter Hastings Falk had arranged for a couple of gallery owners to visit in December. Mr. Falk, an art historian, curator and appraiser who has spent much of his 40-year career promoting unknown, highly accomplished artists, considered Mr. Bertschmann an unrecognized master. ""There couldn't be a better example,"" he said. Mr. Bertschmann's work, he added, ""is at such a high level that it is as compelling or more so than his more famous peers', all of the members of the New York School of the '50s and '60s."" With one crucial difference. While a large Bertschmann painting might, by Mr. Falk's estimate, sell for about $25,000, for an excellent Rothko you could add three zeros to that figure. And then multiply by three. Mr. Bertschmann is an elfin man with comely features and a warm smile, Mrs. Bertschmann a strikingly beautiful woman of 85. Last month, both of them were neatly dressed in similar gray V-neck sweaters as they nervously prepared their apartment for the gallerists' visit. He rarely fails to apologize for what he calls the mess in the living room, where his artwork rests against walls and sits on and in numerous metal cabinets. But the space isn't remotely untidy. His wife explains his fastidiousness by pointing out, ""He's Swiss."" Long before the arrival of Art Basel, the international art fair, Mr. Bertschmann's hometown was an ideal city for a budding artist, with world-class museums, a great university and, most important, an express train that reached Paris in under three hours. ""We would hop on the train,"" Mr. Bertschmann recalled. ""I was 16 or 17. These trips to Paris were very enlightening for me."" Right after World War II, he said, ""everybody was poor, and along the Seine there were booths, and you saw such fabulous stuff."" He showed off four 18th-century Japanese prints and an African bronze that he'd bought back then for next to nothing. ""Imagine being that age,"" Mrs. Bertschmann said, ""and having a taste for those things."" From 1947 to 1951, Mr. Bertschmann attended the Basel School of Design. He studied under Armin Hofmann and apprenticed with Fritz Bühler, both giants of Swiss graphic design. After graduation he moved to the United States, eventually landing in Cleveland, where his artistic output became more inventive and prolific. His work appeared in several galleries, a painting was selected for the Carnegie International, and the Cleveland Museum of Art invited him to submit a painting for its annual group exhibition. It won first prize. Cleveland was also where Mr. Bertschmann met Mary, who at the time was married to an adman who was part of a prominent Cleveland Heights family. ""One day Harry said he wanted to do some sketches of me,"" Mrs. Bertschmann said. ""So I sat for Harry, and he did some sketches, and then he suddenly got up and came over and gave me a kiss. I was very proper, brought up in the Victorian way."" She continued, ""Something happened — I guess the coup de foudre, as they say in French — and we became lovers. Harry and I were lovers for 10 years before I finally got disentangled from my husband. Before I got the courage."" Her husband's agency transferred him to New York, she said, and he adapted quickly to Madison Avenue. ""He turned into a 'Mad man,'"" she recalled. ""Two martinis for lunch."" The couple rented a three-bedroom duplex with a deck in the West Village that had just been vacated by the actress Tammy Grimes, who had recently separated from Christopher Plummer. Before the move, Mrs. Bertschmann recalled, ""I said, Tom, we'll never be able to afford this apartment — it's $350!"" In 1962 she persuaded Mr. Bertschmann that as an artist, he, too, should come to New York. When her marriage finally ended, her husband moved out of the duplex, and in 1966 she married Mr. Bertschmann — ""my true love,"" she said. They stayed in the duplex for four decades, until about 15 years ago, when the landlord died and their rent (then $3,000 a month) was about to jump. Now they face a similar fate with their current apartment. The once-modest Seaport neighborhood is getting fancier. The Best Western a few doors down is transforming into a Cipriani boutique hotel. With both of them on fixed incomes and with no retirement plans to speak of, their high monthly rent, Mrs. Bertschmann said, has them ""hanging by a string."" Of course, at some point they should have bought an apartment, an option that Mrs. Bertschmann said they considered ""so many times."" But they were busy leading creative, exhilarating New York lives. They spent 40 years in an affordable duplex in the most cinematic part of the West Village, so why move? They raised a daughter (Isabelle Kellogg, now a luxury marketer with a grown daughter of her own) and had interesting friends and neighbors, like an editor who worked with Diana Vreeland at Vogue and later Graydon Carter, the longtime Vanity Fair editor, who bought the townhouse next door. Every summer they took a hiking vacation in the Swiss Alps and visited Mr. Bertschmann's family in Basel. But now their need to pay the bills is overshadowing even their desire for Mr. Bertschmann's work to get its due. He still draws every day, but he no longer paints. ""He doesn't have the money for art supplies,"" Mrs. Bertschmann said. So the couple are putting their hopes in the hands of Mr. Falk, promoter of the undiscovered. Mr. Bertschmann first met him back in 2013 after reading an article about a show of works by another overlooked painter, Arthur Pinajian, and deciding that he would like some recognition before he met the same fate. (Mr. Pinajian had been dead 14 years before he was discovered.) Mr. Falk had organized that show, and when Mr. Bertschmann approached him, he was skeptical at encountering yet another hopeful. ""I thought, Oh, no,"" Mr. Falk said. ""Because I can only take on one or two a year."" Still, he agreed to look at Mr. Bertschmann's work. The reaction was immediate. ""I was astounded,"" Mr. Falk recalled. The more he saw, the more he liked. ""Harry's special,"" he said. ""I knew it as soon as he was showing me digital images, and then I was absolutely convinced when I saw thousands of works over 60 years in his apartment."" Through his company, Artist Discovery Group, Mr. Falk brings together museum curators, gallery owners, critics and collectors — the art market's power centers — and works to catalyze interest in the artists. The main obstacle, as he sees it, is the ""pathological myopia of the art world."" In its narrow view, an artist, especially an older one, whose work hasn't already been certified by the market barely even exists. If Google and auction records scarcely know that Mr. Bertschmann is alive, it hardly matters that in 1986 Henry Geldzahler, the larger-than-life curator at the Metropolitan Museum, visited his studio and found his work stellar. Mr. Geldzahler put in a good word at several major galleries, the Bertschmanns said, but when Mr. Bertschmann pursued those leads nothing came of them. To help fill the data vacuum and provide scholarly legitimacy, Mr. Falk enlisted Robert C. Morgan, a member of his company's advisory board of scholars and curators, to write an essay characterizing and validating Mr. Bertschmann's work. He also found a small gallery on the western edge of SoHo called Studio Vendome to mount a show in 2014. But it was poorly attended, partly a result of a small marketing budget. Such are the challenges of promoting underrated talent. Since the Studio Vendome show, Mr. Bertschmann has had some qualified success — the Los Angeles County Museum of Art recently acquired one of his travel posters for its permanent collection — but more setbacks. He read about a gallery that specializes in older artists, submitted his materials in person, and was told that there was a waiting list of 250 artists ahead of him. Then in November, Mr. Falk told him about Christy and Chester Murray, lifelong collectors and neophyte gallerists. One night about five years ago, a friend and some wine persuaded the Murrays, who had recently retired, to buy a store in Quogue, on the East End of Long Island, and turn it into an art gallery. Mr. Falk thought their taste for New York School painters might draw them to Mr. Bertschmann's work. In 2015 Mr. Falk had helped the Murrays bring an exhibition of more than 20 Pinajian works on paper to the Quogue Gallery, and it sold out. (To date, total Pinajian sales from all venues have exceeded $3.5 million, according to Mr. Falk.) Hoping to repeat this success, he set up a meeting with the Murrays last month at the Bertschmanns' apartment. The Murrays spent more than two hours there, and left feeling transported. ""We walked in thinking that maybe Harry would be part of a group show,"" Christy Murray said, ""and left planning a solo show during some of the busiest weeks of the summer."" Less than a week later, they sent an email clarifying those plans, which center on a solo exhibition filling the Quogue Gallery for three weeks next summer. They also decided to double the size of their booth at Art Palm Beach, a fair that starts Jan. 17, to accommodate seven large Bertschmann canvases. And, as with their previous shows, they expect to buy one or more of Mr. Bertschmann's paintings for their private collection, which, in addition to emerging and overlooked artists, includes works by Picasso, Miró and Giacometti. The Bertschmanns were almost afraid to believe that their hoped-for lifeline had arrived, but they allowed themselves to celebrate with a bottle of wine. ""It was so wonderful to meet them and to have them be so interested in everything that Harry had done,"" Mrs. Bertschmann said. ""They just kept looking and looking."" She called the visit ""flabbergasting"" and ""magical."" Even Mr. Bertschmann, always affable but rarely effusive — again, he's Swiss — was visibly happy. Could it really be true that all his years of ""painting like a demon possessed,"" as Mr. Falk put it, could finally be rewarded? Mr. Falk called the Murrays' plans ""a good fresh start for Harry."" Small galleries, he noted, can be more adventurous, less in thrall to youth and trends, than large ones. ""Ultimately, what I'd like to see for Harry is a museum exhibition,"" he said, ideally at the Swiss Institute in New York, which should ""finally pay homage to one of their own, an artist who's really, really deserving."" Representatives of the Swiss Institute have met with Mr. Bertschmann and expressed an interest in working with him, but they plan their shows far in advance, probably too far to help the Bertschmanns out of their current financial plight. While Mr. Falk views the big picture, Mr. Bertschmann trains his eye on the sketch pad directly in front of him. Every day without fail, he continues to put pencil to paper with such single-minded focus that he doesn't see his own career arc, or plan for the future.

That picture was reinforced by a report on Friday from the Labor Department, which showed an increase of 148,000 jobs last month. The figure fell short of economists' expectations, but some of the most impressive job gains in the past year were in blue-collar and service industries that pay a decent salary. Over all, average hourly earnings were 2.5 percent higher in December compared with the year before, scarcely keeping up with inflation. But other data shows that wages have increased most for the least-educated workers and for people in many industries that are generally low-paying. ""Growth is strong, and the benefits of this growth have been widely shared,"" Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Indeed.com, a job-search site. ""This has been a year in which some of the gaps in the economy that had been growing narrowed a bit."" Manual-labor positions are the kinds of jobs that President Trump has promised to bring back in droves, so progress could be politically important. Hiring picked up fastest in construction and mining. Manufacturing, which lost jobs in 2016, expanded last year at a respectable clip, part of a global resurgence. Reflecting the economy's resilience, overall hiring in 2017 was only slightly lower than in 2016 — and it has risen for 87 consecutive months, a remarkable feat. The unemployment rate was steady at 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. The numbers point to an economy that still has some room to grow. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Mr. Trump cited the unemployment rate as evidence that the economy is ""only getting better!"" When he took office last January, the rate was 4.8 percent. Most economists say presidents do not generally determine the economy's course, and it is too early to measure the hiring effects of the tax cut signed into law last month. But Mr. Trump's agenda may be having an impact on the economy in other ways. His push to dismantle regulations on businesses seems to have emboldened corporations to start putting more money into machines and plants, the kind of spending that drives broad growth. A separate survey of manufacturers released on Wednesday suggested that American factories have picked up their orders, production and hiring over the past year. Democrats offered a less sanguine view of the labor market, asserting that most Americans were still enduring paltry raises and that the Republican tax plan was a boon only to the upper stratum of the country. Among the solutions advocated by Democrats is to increase the minimum wage, as 18 states did on Jan. 1. ""The American economy is unbalanced,"" Representative Joe Crowley of New York, the leader of the House Democratic Caucus, said in a statement. ""Workers struggle to find financial security while special interests, corporations, and the richest among us enjoy lavish tax breaks."" Wages have been one of the most intensely debated puzzles of the labor market, with incomes growing at a more sluggish rate than the hiring demand would suggest. There are signs beneath the surface, though, that more widespread wage growth may be around the corner. The security industry, for example, where pay is below average, showed a 7 percent increase in hourly earnings in November from a year earlier. Workers in clothing stores and food services — two huge, generally low-paying businesses — saw wages rise by around 4 percent in that period. In areas where unemployment has dipped below the national rate, pay has begun to accelerate. Cities where joblessness is 3.5 percent or lower have had an impressive 4 percent year-over-year increase in earnings, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics. In Indianapolis, where unemployment reached 3.1 percent in November, wages for jobs in the private sector rose by nearly 5 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. ""If the unemployment rate everywhere gets to 3.5 percent, then wage growth everywhere will get to 4 percent,"" Mr. Shepherdson said. That kind of tightening may nudge some employers who have resisted giving raises. ""The wage growth rate kicking in isn't an automatic thing that happens in the economy,"" said Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, a job-listing platform. ""It requires employers to feel that friction, that competition for talent, to change what they offer recruits."" E-commerce companies have begun to raise wages in hot warehouse markets, such as Memphis or the Inland Empire in Southern California, said Bill Ravenscroft, a senior vice president at Adecco Staffing USA. The agency employs around 60,000 workers, hiring more during the holiday season, and places many in distribution centers and warehouses often used by e-commerce giants. But employers are not taking that approach across the board. Many are vying for pickers, packers and shippers by offering new perks. Logistics companies have begun providing on-site child care, or reimbursing employees who need to put their children in day care while they work. Some companies are entering workers in raffles every week to win laptops, televisions and tablets, or are bringing food trucks to their warehouses and paying for employees' lunches. ""These types of benefits in the past, you associated them with Silicon Valley, start-up companies,"" Mr. Ravenscroft said. ""They weren't synonymous with your traditional employers."" Clients are hesitant to offer permanent wage increases, he said, but that could change if the jobless rate continues to dip. Bob Peterson, the chief executive of Melton Truck Lines, said he had been feeling the job market's heat all year, and that he now had no choice but to raise pay for his 1,600 drivers. ""With unemployment this low, anyone worth their salt has got a job and probably a darn good one,"" Mr. Peterson said. Melton operates in 48 states and has offices in five. The tight job market has been especially tough on Mr. Peterson, because he requires a drug test for everyone who comes through the door. Many fail, especially after several states legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use. ""There's guys and gals that like to smoke weed, but they can't drive a commercial vehicle because it's prohibited,"" Mr. Peterson said. ""Some people get here and we find out, oops, they have been smoking or injecting."" Mr. Peterson has not given raises in two years, he said, because when he had asked his clients to increase their rates, they threatened to hire another trucking company. He is planning to increase salaries by 10 percent in 2018. Part of the reason, he said, was that he was seeing hiring pick up in the construction business and in manufacturing, two sectors that he competed with for able bodies. ""No one is having an easy time hiring blue-collar workers today,"" Mr. Peterson said. Those pressures are bearing down on manufacturing, which added a solid 196,000 jobs last year, and construction, where payrolls increased by 210,000. Mining employers also posted solid gains, bucking a trend of job losses in recent years. The crash in oil prices in 2014 was particularly hard on jobs in the mining sector, which includes support services in oil fields, and had ripple effects on construction and manufacturing, partly because American companies make much of the world's mining equipment. Oil prices have begun to climb, and that may be one piece of the expansion in all three sectors, economists said. The rest of the world is also in the midst of a strong recovery, helping to drive an American uptick in productive blue-collar work. ""The manufacturing upturn story is a global story,"" Mr. Shepherdson said. ""It's happening everywhere. You can't take credit for the recovery in Europe and China."""
News,2018-01-05,WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and South Korean officials met in Washington on Friday to begin formally renegotiating a free-trade pact that has served as a source of conflict between the two allies. The meeting came at a moment of heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula and unease in the broader region.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/us/politics/us-korea-trade-talks.html,1100," WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and South Korean officials met in Washington on Friday to begin formally renegotiating a free-trade pact that has served as a source of conflict between the two allies. The meeting came at a moment of heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula and unease in the broader region. The countries focused on their main areas of interest, with the United States emphasizing trade in automobiles and what it considers various barriers to exports, American negotiators said. ""We have much work to do to reach an agreement that serves the economic interests of the American people,"" Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in a statement after the meeting. President Trump has called the six-year-old agreement a ""horrible deal"" for the United States and has pledged to rework it. Over a series of meetings in the coming months, American negotiators hope to further open Korean markets to American cars and to smooth irritants in the trading relationship. But clashes over trading terms could risk dividing the longstanding allies at a critical time, as North Korea seeks to drive a wedge between South Korea and the United States, analysts say. North Korea restored a cross-border telephone hotline with its southern neighbor on Wednesday, just one day after Mr. Trump said he had a ""much bigger"" nuclear button than the one North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, had boasted of having on his desk. ""The reality is, it's a fraught moment between the U.S. and South Korea in terms of their alliance,"" said Sue Mi Terry, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Renegotiating the deal at this juncture ""is going to widen the gap between Seoul and Washington,"" she said. The Trump administration's approach to trade has also caused consternation in the wider Pacific region at a time of geopolitical unease. The White House is emphasizing trade deals with specific countries rather than broader economic alliances. The approach counters efforts by the Obama administration, which sought to tie countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean together under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It also comes as China moves to piece together a sphere of influence through regional trade agreements and infrastructure projects. Since withdrawing its support for the T.P.P., the Trump administration has sought trade concessions from Japan. But Japan has focused on a version of the T.P.P. that does not include the United States and has expressed an unwillingness to settle for a narrower trade deal. With South Korea, the White House's overarching goal for renegotiating the trade pact is to reduce America's trade deficit, which was $17 billion in 2016. But analysts view such a goal with skepticism, saying that the tendency of the United States to import more than it exports is linked to larger economic factors like saving and spending rates, not the terms of trade agreements. Each side was likely to look to the other on Friday to articulate their goals for the renegotiation, said Wendy Cutler, the former chief United States negotiator for the deal. The United States will probably focus on areas of the agreement that it believes have not met its expectations, Ms. Cutler said, including trade in automobiles and, potentially, financial services and procedures related to importing goods. She noted that the Trump administration had not notified Congress of its intention to renegotiate the agreement, something that is required before substantial changes are made. That may suggest that the United States is not seeking to significantly alter the terms of the deal or that, although it is seeking changes from South Korea, it is not willing to make big concessions itself. The United States Korea Free Trade Agreement, America's largest trade pact after the North American Free Trade Agreement, was negotiated during the President George W. Bush's administration and signed by the two countries in 2007. It set off enormous protests from Koreans in 2008 over concerns about the safety of imported goods, such as beef. And it was not ratified by Congress until 2011, after President Barack Obama reworked the pact. The agreement took effect in March 2012, cutting almost all tariffs and many other trade barriers between the countries. The deal opened South Korea, now the United States' seventh-largest export market for goods, to imports of American agriculture, services and investment, and the American market to Korean cars and other manufactured goods like washing machines. Trade officials estimated in 2007 that the lower barriers to trade under the agreement would increase annual exports of American goods by up to $11 billion, a claim that Mr. Obama repeated. But, as the Trump administration has argued, that did not happen. ""Since KORUS went into effect, our trade deficit in goods with Korea has doubled from $13.2 billion to $27.6 billion, while U.S. goods exports have actually gone down,"" Mr. Lighthizer, said in a statement in July. ""This is quite different from what the previous administration sold to the American people when it urged approval of this agreement. We can and must do better."" Much of the American trade deficit in goods with Korea is generated by automobiles, a key reason cars will probably be a primary focus of the talks. Korean car brands like Hyundai and Kia are popular in the United States, but American carmakers have struggled to gain as much ground in South Korea as their European and Asian competitors. The trade picture looks more balanced when factoring in services. In 2016, the United States had a $27.7 billion trade deficit in goods with Korea, but a $10.7 billion surplus in services — about a third higher than before the agreement entered into force. Caroline Freund, a former senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that changes to the agreement could potentially reduce the bilateral trade deficit the United States runs with South Korea. However, any changes are unlikely to have any significant impact on the overall trade deficit that the United States runs with the rest of the world, she said. James W. Fatheree, the vice president of Asia for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said the trade deficit was a ""flawed metric"" for measuring the success of the deal and that many in the business community support the deal because it had been good for their industries. Mr. Fatheree said the Koreans had fallen short of putting into effect some areas of the agreement, but he pointed to high levels of American good exports to Korea in 2017, substantial gains for American agriculture and rising service exports. ""We want to make sure we keep the agreement intact,"" he said."
News,2018-01-05,"When Amuche Chukudebelu, a programmer at a finance company, became a landlord about a decade ago, he knew very little about how to set the rent for the two apartments he planned to rent out in his brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/realestate/small-landlord-calculate-rent.html,2026," When Amuche Chukudebelu, a programmer at a finance company, became a landlord about a decade ago, he knew very little about how to set the rent for the two apartments he planned to rent out in his brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. He didn't want to be a landlord who was constantly raising the rent on his tenants. But despite locking in relatively high rents initially, the market quickly rose around him, and by 2014, he had one tenant paying $1,450 a month when the market rate was closer to $2,000. ""I was like, 'Wait a second. I'm way below market,'"" said Mr. Chukudebelu, who has since become a real estate agent at Citi Habitats and found his dilemma at best uncomfortable. ""You want to be compassionate, but there are also expenses that are increasing. And the market is the market."" While the city's larger, institutional landlords may use algorithms to set rents, informing tenants of increases by letter, for many smaller landlords, the process is not so impersonal. They may rent just a few units, often in the building where they live, relying on the income to make their mortgage payments. Many see their tenants in the hall, know what kind of music they listen to and exchange neighborhood gossip on the stoop. And though most say that they follow general principles and guidelines when determining rents, not all of those are financial, and they are far from uniform. Squaring business interests with one's personal and political beliefs, of course, can be a messy business. Consider the brouhaha last year when Politico revealed that Mayor Bill de Blasio, a small landlord who has made affordable housing one of his signature issues, had raised the rent on one of the units in a two-family Park Slope house that he and his wife own. While the increase, from $2,400 in 2009 to $2,850 in 2016, broke down to a relatively modest 2 or 3 percent per year, Mr. de Blasio, who declined to be interviewed for this story, had spent the previous two years calling for — and getting — zero percent increases for the city's rent-stabilized units. While the Rent Guidelines Board sets increases for the city's million or so rent-regulated tenants, increases on market-rate units are entirely at the discretion of landlords, who weigh potential profits against the possibility of losing reliable tenants and the cost of vacancy. As for determining what the market rate is, small landlords say they do various things, from looking through nearby listings to asking neighbors and visiting open houses. And in New York, there are many more of those small landlords than you might think. The Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord advocacy group, says that 70 percent of its 25,000 members are small-property owners, who have one or two buildings with no more than 48 apartments in each. Christopher Athineos, who with his parents owns 150 apartments in 9 buildings, a mix of rent-regulated and market-rate units in Bay Ridge, Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights, said that while ""obviously this is our business, you get close to it"" — especially if you get to know your tenants well. His parents bought their first property in 1968 and still live in one of their buildings. Mr. Athineos grew up with some of his current tenants and goes to their children's baptisms and other events. He even agreed to help the niece of an older tenant scatter the ashes of that tenant when she passed away. ""I do cut people a break. I have a couple of senior citizens in Bay Ridge — one woman, her husband passed away a long time ago, she's in her 80s, on fixed income. I'm like, 'Sign the lease renewal, no increase,'"" Mr. Athineos said. ""Or I increase her $5, so she doesn't feel like a charity case."" For other tenants, he said he usually raises rent by 1 to 3 percent on the second renewal. ""No one likes an increase on their first year,"" Mr. Athineos said. ""But I've made the mistake in the past where I don't increase them for four years, then all of a sudden, you have to ask them for $75 or $100, and they're like, ""'Oh my god, you're killing me.'"" The key thing, landlords agree, is to hang onto good tenants — the ones who pay on time, take care of the apartment and call you when the radiator's leaking all over the floor, but not, as one landlord said, ""because the refrigerator makes too much noise."" Minimizing turnover is important, because empty apartments have to get cleaned, repainted and repaired. And there is often at least a one-month gap between tenants, with no rent coming in. Some landlords avoid raising the rent at all when they have a good tenant, preferring to catch up to the market the next time they list the apartment. ""I never raise it when they're there,"" said Jude Bernard, who started buying brownstones in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, in the late 1990s. ""I was lucky enough to buy my buildings when they were well, well below what they're worth today. My mortgage is very low. My unwritten rule is: You don't bother me, I don't bother you."" One tenant whom he had been renting to since 2006 ""was like a ghost,"" he said approvingly, so he was happy to keep her at the same rent that she paid when she moved into the three-bedroom duplex garden apartment, $2,500 a month. But last summer, the tenant got a new roommate who started calling him all the time about what he said were minor problems or nonissues. So at renewal time, he sent them a letter raising the rent to $4,500. ""She assured me her new roommate would not be calling me anymore, and we negotiated a new rent of $3,500,"" Mr. Bernard said. ""From what I gathered, the new roommate came from a Manhattan doorman building and was accustomed to 'Hey, a light in the apartment is out.' That's not brownstone living. We don't do concierge service."" Landlords who share houses with their tenants are often even more willing to go below market rate — sometimes substantially — for a friendly tenant. Mary and Larry Heintjes are artists who own a carriage house on the border of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, and rent out a studio apartment across the hall from their two-bedroom. The unit goes for well under market rate. As Ms. Heintjes explained, ""We wanted a certain kind of person, someone who is kind and communicative. We didn't want to lose that kind of person by charging a rent that would be for someone who is more corporate."" That view was shaped by their history in the house. The same day that they closed on the property in 1997, Mr. Heintjes's mother had a stroke. During the renovation, they decided that she should move in with them. She stayed for five years, until she needed round-the-clock care, which is when they turned her room into a studio apartment. With property taxes increasing and their two daughters nearing college age, they needed the extra income, but they wanted a renter who felt like family. Charging considerably below market rate has allowed them to get just that. Previous tenants, a couple who bought a house in Albany, stay with them regularly when they are in the city. But last spring, they needed to find a new tenant after nearly a decade with virtually no rent increases, so they consulted a friend, Craig Meachen, who is also a real estate broker. He helped them calculate a rent that was several hundred dollars higher than they had been charging, getting them closer to market rate. But even in the coziest relationships, money — and paying the mortgage — can be a big issue. After Bibi Calderaro, an artist and broker, and her husband, a photographer, bought a townhouse in Bed-Stuy six years ago, they rented out the garden apartment for $1,800 a month. The first few tenants were on yearlong fellowships, and another moved out because she wanted a dog. With every transition, they recalibrated the rent to the rising market. Last year, they listed the apartment for $2,300, or $100 more than the previous tenant had been paying, and got no takers. Then they lowered the price to what the last tenant had been paying, and still it didn't rent. Grudgingly, they lowered it again, to $2,175, in response to what the market was telling them. But that didn't make the rent decrease any easier to take. That monthly income is how ""I pay my mortgage,"" Ms. Calderaro said. ""We're not only trying to keep up with inflation, but the real estate taxes have gone up. Our economy is much more fragile than larger landlords'."" Still, if there is a common thread among most small landlords in the city, it is that they choose not to chase the highest rent they could get. When Marta Satwin-Ramberg, an architect, and her husband, a graphic designer, bought and renovated a three-unit rowhouse in Ridgewood, Queens, six years ago, they picked a midpoint between the going rate for unrenovated apartments in the area and what seemed like unreasonable asks in several nearby buildings that developers had redone. Last fall, they asked $2,000 for a railroad-style two-bedroom. ""I'm not going to be pushing the top boundaries of what I could get, ""Ms. Satwin-Ramberg said. ""I'd rather rent to friends of friends. I feel like the way I set those rents are what would be bearable for me."" Amit Kalra owns three properties in Queens and several more in Nashville, to which he applies very different rental philosophies. He bought his first building, in Woodside, seven years ago, after his father died. His mother took one of the six units, and for a time, his sister lived in another. He lived right around the corner and got to know the tenants well, inviting them to barbecues at his house. When taxes or heating costs go up, he sends them a letter explaining the increase and how it will affect their rent. And for the past three years, he has kept the rent flat for a tenant with a special-needs child. In Nashville, however, he uses a management company and, until new inventory started flooding the market last year, would regularly ask for 6 or 7 percent annual increases. He made his decisions based on recommendations from the management company and his own research on the market there. ""I don't see the Nashville properties every day, so I treat it more like a business,"" Mr. Kalra said. ""In Woodside, it's much more friendly. You can't help but be emotionally attached. You become conscious of the tenants' situations and that the biggest check they write every month is to you."" Being cognizant of those things can certainly make asking for more rent difficult, as Mr. Chukudebelu, the landlord in Bed-Stuy, discovered when he finally approached his $1,450-a-month tenant about an increase. At first, he asked for $100 more a month, which she agreed was reasonable. But the next year, when he tried to raise it another $100, she balked, and they negotiated a two-year lease with $75 and $50 increases, which would eventually bring the rent to $1,675. After that, he said, ""came the moment of truth."" He asked for another $75 increase, wanting to bring the rent to within a few hundred dollars of the $2,000 market rate. ""And I knew that was a stretch for her,"" he said. ""That definitely weighed on me. But then I was like, 'Do I take a loss so she doesn't?'"" Ultimately, the tenant got a roommate, and they now pay $1,800 a month, which puts the rent close enough to market rate that Mr. Chukudebelu can ask for much smaller increases at future renewals. In hindsight, he realized that his impulse to avoid raising the rent at all on a good tenant was well intentioned but a bit naïve, since it put him so far behind. ""I wanted to be compassionate,"" he said, ""but that was a little too much of a compassionate viewpoint."""

News,2018-01-06,"UNITED NATIONS — Efforts by the Trump administration to marshal a muscular international response to Iran’s crackdown on anti-government protesters appeared to backfire on Friday, as members of the United Nations Security Council instead used a special session called by the United States to lecture the American ambassador on the proper purpose of the body and to reaffirm support for the Iran nuclear agreement.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/world/middleeast/un-iran-protests-debate.html,861," UNITED NATIONS — Efforts by the Trump administration to marshal a muscular international response to Iran's crackdown on anti-government protesters appeared to backfire on Friday, as members of the United Nations Security Council instead used a special session called by the United States to lecture the American ambassador on the proper purpose of the body and to reaffirm support for the Iran nuclear agreement. It was an afternoon of high diplomatic theater that began with a passionate denunciation of Iran's ""oppressive government"" by the American ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, and ended with the Iranian ambassador delivering a lengthy history of popular revolt in the United States — from the violent demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention in 1968 to the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. In the interim, Council members did, one by one, condemn the Iranian government's response during more than a week of protests. As of Friday, more than 20 people had been killed and hundreds had been arrested. The authorities have blocked access to social media and have blamed foreign ""enemies"" for instigating the unrest, a common refrain at times of upheaval that in this case the government has provided no evidence to support. In her remarks, Ms. Haley said that the United States would remain steadfastly behind the Iranian protesters. ""Let there be no doubt whatsoever,"" she said, ""the United States stands unapologetically with those in Iran who seek freedom for themselves."" But there was evidence of a mini-revolt brewing within the Security Council chamber, not only among traditional adversaries like Russia and China, but also among close allies like France and Sweden. Many seemed to fear that the outspoken criticism by the Americans was simply a pretext to undermine the Iran nuclear deal, which President Trump has long desired to scrap. It is not precisely clear what Ms. Haley hoped to achieve by convening the session on Friday, which was not previously scheduled. Until the meeting began at 3 p.m., it was not even certain whether Ms. Haley would be able to secure the votes needed to call the session to order. But even before the session began, France's ambassador, François Delattre, warned against ""instrumentalization"" of the protests ""from the outside."" Speaking before the Council, he went further. ""We must be wary of any attempt to exploit this crisis for personal ends, which would have a diametrically opposed outcome to that which is wished,"" Mr. Delattre said. The Russian ambassador, Vasily A. Nebenzya, was more blunt. He asked rhetorically why the Security Council had not taken up the issue of Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson, Mo., which were at times also met with a violent police response. ""The real reason for convening today's meeting is not an attempt to protect human rights or promote the interests of the Iranian people, but rather as a veiled attempt to use the current moment to continue to undermine"" the Iranian deal, Mr. Nebenzya said. Mr. Trump has repeatedly excoriated the deal, which was a signature diplomatic achievement of his predecessor, Barack Obama. In October, he refused to recertify the deal, though he left it to Congress to legislate changes to it. (None of the other world powers that signed the deal believes that renegotiation is possible.) Later this month, Mr. Trump will again have to choose whether to continue to waive sanctions, as the deal requires, or chart a more confrontational approach that would further antagonize European allies. Mr. Trump himself conflated the protests with the Iran nuclear deal this week, arguing that financial benefits received by the Iranian authorities as part of the accord had fueled the corruption that the country's people were now protesting. At the Security Council on Friday, most members insisted that these two issues were separate. ""It needs to be crystal clear to the international community that the situation in Iran does not belong on the agenda of the Security Council,"" said Sacha Sergio Llorenty Solíz, the Bolivian ambassador. Sweden's representative, Irina Schoulgin Nyoni, concurred: ""We have our reservations on the format and timing of this session."" Such reluctance to support the American position is the latest evidence of growing international resistance to the Trump administration's foreign policy priorities, particularly at the United Nations. Last month, a large majority of United Nations members voted for a resolution denouncing the United States' decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the American Embassy there. Ms. Haley had to use her veto to block a similar resolution in the Security Council that was supported by every other member. On Wednesday, the United States Mission to the United Nations held a cocktail reception for the countries that did not support the resolution in the General Assembly. While 56 countries abstained from voting or did not show up, only nine countries voted against it. Aside from Israel and the United States, these included Guatemala, Honduras, Togo, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru and Palau. In a video message played at the reception, Mr. Trump thanked the attendees for ""standing with the United States."" He said that the vote would ""go down as a very important date,"" and that their support was ""noted and greatly appreciated."""
News,2018-01-06,"The brightly colored labels began appearing on bottles and cans of beer, wine and liquor in a government-owned store in Yukon Territory a month before Christmas.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/world/canada/yukon-liquor-alcohol-warnings.html,1067," The brightly colored labels began appearing on bottles and cans of beer, wine and liquor in a government-owned store in Yukon Territory a month before Christmas. The brainchild of a research project financed by the Canadian government on how to prevent excessive drinking, the labels warned of the health risks of alcohol consumption and were meant to be in place for eight months as an experiment. But within a month, the experiment was halted. The government stopped affixing the labels after several alcohol industry lobbying groups challenged both the research study and the legality of the government's participation. John Streicker, the member of the Yukon government's cabinet responsible for the territory's liquor stores, said he believed that the government faced litigation if it continued to use the researchers' labels. With a population of 36,000, the territory is not in a financial position to take on the global alcohol industry in court, he added. ""The costs that we could be facing are significant,"" Mr. Streicker said. ""We need to do the responsible thing, which is to judge whether that's the best use of our money for our citizens. The hard choice is whether to pay for lawyers or whether to pay for harm reduction."" Lobbying groups representing Canada's breweries, wineries and distilleries, Mr. Streicker said, suggested that the labels might harm their brands and asked about the territory's legal right to apply them. The industry also suggested that putting stickers on their bottles and cans infringed trademarks, he said. In interviews on Wednesday, the presidents of Beer Canada, the brewers' trade group, and of the Association of Canadian Distillers, said they had not threatened legal action. But Jan H. Westcott, the president and chief executive of the distillers' group, repeatedly criticized the validity of the information on the labels and the work of the researchers themselves. ""I don't think that the way that they've approached it is actually going to provide results that are useful or legitimate necessarily,"" Mr. Westcott said of the peer-reviewed study. Mr. Streicker said, ""If it was to go to court I think they would use all avenues open to them to try and challenge this study."" The label experiment was part of a four-year-old project led by Erin Hobin, a scientist at the province of Ontario's public health agency, in cooperation with the University of Victoria in British Columbia. The research is financed by Health Canada, a federal department. The sale of alcohol is controlled by provincial and territorial governments and, in most of Canada, largely sold through government-owned stores. Tim Stockwell, the director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research at the University of Victoria, who is also involved in the project, said Yukon's alcohol retailer was the only one in Canada willing to test the stickers. Yukon has the highest per capita sales of alcohol in the country, adding to the researchers' interest. Focus groups with drinkers were held over about two years within Whitehorse, the capital of the Yukon. Dr. Hobin said they showed strong support for health warnings on liquor bottles. ""There is just very low availability of information about health hazards around alcohol,"" said Dr. Hobin, whose research indicated that three-quarters of drinkers in the Yukon were not aware of the link between some cancers and alcohol. In November, the American Society of Clinical Oncology released a statement indicating that even light drinking could slightly increase a woman's risk of breast cancer and increased the chances of developing a common form of esophageal cancer. Alcohol was first linked to a variety of cancers by a branch of the World Health Organization in 1987. The plan was to stick labels on the bottles for eight months and then use sales data and follow-up interviews to assess their effect on drinking. Liquor stores and drinkers in the neighboring Northwest Territories would have been a control group. Yukon has been putting stickers about drinking during pregnancy on alcohol for nearly 30 years. The study's labels, however, were larger and more brightly colored than the previous ones used in Yukon liquor stores. One offered a slimmed-down version of Canada's alcohol drinking guidelines, which were developed with the alcohol industry's participation. The other warned that alcohol can cause cancer. Dr. Hobin said their designs were influenced by Canada's mandatory warnings for cigarette packages that featured grisly photos of smoking-related diseases. But in comparison, the alcohol labels are subdued. While the territory's stickers about drinking during pregnancy never attracted attention from the alcohol industry, Mr. Streicker, the Yukon government official, said he soon heard about the study's labels. Mr. Westcott, the president of the distillers' group, said, ""We think these are pretty complex issues and simply putting them on a label is not necessarily the best way to do that,"" adding that he did not think that Whitehorse was an appropriate place for the study because of its comparatively small population and remoteness. Luke Harford, the president of the brewers' lobbying group, said he was concerned that some shoppers might conclude that the label about the drinking guidelines — which recommends abstinence twice a week — could be misinterpreted as a safe amount of drinking before driving. As for the other label, Mr. Harford said, ""It's this very alarming statement that this is going to cause cancer."" Although both Mr. Harford and Mr. Westcott said they never suggested that their organizations or their members would sue if the labeling continued, they also acknowledged that they asked, as Mr. Westcott put it, ""what legal authority they had to put the labels on the products."" The government, he said, has not ""provided that information."" Dr. Stockwell of the research project said the federal government, the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia and his university also received complaints from the alcohol industry. Robert Solomon, a professor of law at the University of Western Ontario in London who has specialized in drug and alcohol policy for more than 40 years, said rulings by the Supreme Court of Canada about warnings on cigarette packages clearly gave the Yukon government the right to add its labels. He dismissed the idea of trademark or defamation lawsuits as ""without merit."" ""It's somewhat sad that the industry opposes making consumers aware of the harms related to alcohol,"" Professor Soloman said. ""The alcohol industry doesn't really want the public to look at alcohol as a drug. It's a drug that imposes health costs."""
News,2018-01-06,Humira is the best-selling prescription drug in the world. You may have seen the commercials.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/business/humira-drug-prices.html,1152," Humira is the best-selling prescription drug in the world. You may have seen the commercials. Because of Humira, a woman with rheumatoid arthritis can wash her puppy in the bathtub, another with colitis can stroll happily through a fair packed with food vendors, while a third suffering from psoriasis can go to the gym without hiding her neck. But they probably wouldn't all look so relieved if they saw the bill. The price of Humira, an anti-inflammatory drug dispensed in an injectable pen, has risen from about $19,000 a year in 2012, to more than $38,000 today, per patient, after rebates, according to SSR Health, a research firm. That's an increase of 100 percent. Pharma bosses probably miss Martin Shkreli, the reigning villain of the industry. If you'll recall, Mr. Shkreli, as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, acquired Daraprim, a drug used to fight infections in AIDS patients, and then raised the price overnight to $750 a pill from $13.50. He also trolled critics and spent $2 million on a one-of-a-kind Wu Tang Clan album, before his conviction on three securities fraud charges last year. For a time, Mr. Shkreli's antics, along with the soaring price of EpiPens, sold by Mylan, deflected attention from the rest of the industry. A more typical play for drug companies — the Humira play — is to start at a high price and keep raising it ever higher, but incrementally. ""What they have done with Humira is just as unfair, just as morally wrong, but they did it over five years,"" said Ben Wakana, a former Obama administration spokesman who became executive director of Patients for Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group, because his younger brother couldn't afford Humira without the financial support of their parents. ""People are skipping doses, people are rationing, people are going into bankruptcy because of this drug,"" he said in an interview, arguing that Humira is both more expensive per dose and has a far higher volume than Daraprim. AbbVie, which was spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013, declined to comment. How much you actually pay out of pocket, and whether you can afford Humira at all, depend on your insurance and eligibility for discounts. Anne Marie Garza, 51, an administrative assistant in Houston who suffers from colitis and Crohn's disease, said she had held off buying her latest dose because her insurer had changed. She was trying to see if she could avoid an out-of-pocket payment of more than $1,200, one of two she would have to make this year, on top of her rising expenses for vitamins and supplements to manage the disease. She has relatively good insurance, but the payments will strain her budget. ""During the holidays, I was contemplating what am I'm going to do,"" she said. ""I was thinking should I just go on a liquid diet, because I can't afford this."" It's a difficult choice. ""It does give you your life back,"" she said of the drug. ""I literally couldn't go away from the house or very far from a bathroom, 20, 25 times in the bathroom all day long, I can't imagine living like that,"" she said, adding, ""I was becoming a hermit because I was so sick."" Humira, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of AbbVie's $25.6 billion in revenue in 2016, was not simple to develop. It is among a new class of drugs known as biologics, which are made from living cells rather than synthetic chemicals. The industry has argued that high American prices are needed to fund drug development, but a 2016 study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association found ""no evidence of an association between research and development costs and prices; rather, prescription drugs are priced in the United States primarily on the basis of what the market will bear."" Competitive pressures have been muted. Copies of biologic drugs, known as biosimilars, are not as easy to produce as normal generic drugs, and AbbVie's aggressive patent strategy has allowed it to further push off rivals. While there are name brand competitors to Humira, they are not exactly alike, complicating efforts by doctors or insurers to switch a patient from one drug to another. Looking at the international picture tells its own story about drug costs. A prefilled carton with two syringes costs $2,669 in the United States, compared with $1,362 in Britain, $822 in Switzerland and $552 in South Africa, according to a 2015 report from the International Federation of Health Plans. ""You've got the largest market for pharmaceuticals, which has the highest prices,"" said Christopher Raymond, senior biotech analyst at Piper Jaffray. ""That doesn't make any sense."" But it is typical. Other countries have single-payer systems, like Britain's National Health Service, that negotiate with drug companies or governments that exert price controls. AbbVie has put some of its earnings to work lobbying against efforts at price controls in the United States, recently in California. The industry also successfully lobbied in 2006 to bar Medicare from negotiating over drug prices. While President Trump once talked about taking action on drug prices, his administration did not follow through in the health care debate last year. By contrast, Britain's National Health Service, while strained of late, has more formidable negotiating leverage. ""I do think we need something like that in the United States, not the N.H.S. broadly, but some means of dealing with the extreme pricing instances,"" said Richard Evans, founder of SSR Health. An analysis by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review found that Humira's list price would need to be discounted by at least 55 percent to be cost effective for rheumatoid arthritis, its originally approved use. Dr. Steven D. Pearson, the founder of the institute, which provides cost benefit data to health plans, said competing drugs were overpriced as well. ""Even in a space like this, where there is a lot of competition, we don't see the prices coming down,"" he said. ""That speaks to the fact that it doesn't often function like a free market usually would."" For now, Americans have to rely on the generosity of the drug industry, such as it is. I took a spin through AbbVie's corporate Code of Conduct, entitled ""Inspired by Integrity."" It's a lofty document. ""WE ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING PATIENTS' LIVES,"" it says, in all caps. It even makes a point of saying that AbbVie supports the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That declaration, if you read it, says, ""Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care."" AbbVie joined a few of its rivals in saying it would limit price increases to single digits this year, and so only raised Humira by another 9.7 percent this month, roughly four and a half times the inflation rate. For the drug industry, that counts as generosity."
News,2018-01-06,"Diane Butrus, a business executive from St. Louis, wandered the streets of Zurich, looking for a bank that would help her keep $1.5 million hidden from America tax collectors.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/business/stefan-buck-tax-evasion.html,2878," Diane Butrus, a business executive from St. Louis, wandered the streets of Zurich, looking for a bank that would help her keep $1.5 million hidden from America tax collectors. One bank after another turned her down on that afternoon in 2009. They were worried about a United States crackdown on tax evasion and were no longer willing to shelter American money. Finally, across the street from a city park, up a discreet elevator, seated in a luxurious conference room, Ms. Butrus found a banker ready to help. His name was Stefan Buck. Mr. Buck said that his employer, Bank Frey, would be happy to take Ms. Butrus's money, according to court documents and interviews with Mr. Buck and Ms. Butrus. He instructed her to wire the $1.5 million to Bank Frey. He told her that her name wouldn't be attached to the new account. It would be known internally as Cardinal, an alias she chose in a nod to her favorite baseball team. After that, Ms. Butrus contacted Mr. Buck via prepaid cellphones she picked up at a Walgreens drugstore. Every six months or so, she flew to Zurich to withdraw money directly from Mr. Buck. She would return to the United States secretly carrying just under $10,000 in cash — the cutoff for having to make a customs declaration. The setup allowed Ms. Butrus to avoid paying tens of thousands of dollars in income taxes. And it wouldn't have been possible without Mr. Buck and Bank Frey. As much as chocolate and watches, Switzerland is known for bank secrecy. That made the country a destination for money that the wealthy wanted to hide. Last decade, it also made Swiss banks targets for an assault by the United States government, which was tired of Americans escaping taxes on money in offshore accounts. Many banks came clean, divulging their clients to American authorities. Many Americans, including Ms. Butrus, searched for new places to park their money. Bank Frey was among the very few to defy the legal onslaught. And Mr. Buck, a clean-cut and self-confident 28-year-old at the time he met Ms. Butrus, was the bank's public face, responsible for landing and then managing American accounts. That put Mr. Buck in the government's cross hairs. In 2013, a federal grand jury indicted him for conspiring to help Americans avoid taxes. It seemed like another blow against Swiss bank secrecy. But things didn't go as prosecutors had planned — and the chain of events could have big consequences for America's fight to keep people from evading taxes using offshore bank accounts. Mr. Buck was raised in Germany. His parents had been championship ice dancers; his mother competed in figure skating for Switzerland in the 1972 Olympics in Japan. His father ran an insurance company, and Mr. Buck figured that one day he would take it over. But an acquaintance from business school offered him a job in early 2007 at Bank Frey. The bank was tiny, with about 20 employees. Mr. Buck shared an office with four people, including the bank's receptionist. ""We all got along well,"" he said. The business revolved around clients that the bank's founder, Markus Frey, had accumulated over the years, according to Mr. Buck and the court testimony of another former bank employee. At first, there wasn't a focus on Americans. Then, in 2008, a legal earthquake shook the foundations of Swiss banking. American prosecutors started filing criminal charges against bankers and executives who had set up accounts for Americans. In 2009, UBS, the huge Swiss bank, admitted helping Americans hide money from the Internal Revenue Service and agreed to provide authorities with the names of its tax-dodging clients. Soon Swiss banks were expelling American clients. Not Bank Frey. It didn't have offices in the United States, and executives didn't see it as their responsibility to police whether their clients were paying taxes. ""We decided there's no reason not to maintain business with American clients,"" Mr. Buck said in an interview. Executives consulted with legal experts to ensure they weren't crossing any lines. ""We really tried to make sure that how we did the business is correct."" Opening accounts for desperate Americans seemed like a golden opportunity. ""The positioning of Bank Frey as a solely Swiss private bank is now considered as a competitive advantage by the market,"" the bank's chief executive, Gregor Bienz, said at a board meeting in late 2008, according to records of the meeting. Mr. Bienz didn't respond to requests for comment. Over the next few years, hundreds of millions of dollars in American deposits flowed from Swiss banking stalwarts — institutions like Credit Suisse and Julius Baer — to Bank Frey. Its number of American clients roughly tripled, according to court records. By September 2012, nearly half of the bank's $2.1 billion in assets was held on behalf of American taxpayers. Ms. Butrus was one of them. C. Richard Lucy, a former Goldman Sachs and Bank of America executive in New York, was another. In late 2009, Mr. Lucy's contact at Julius Baer, where he'd had an account for many years, told him he had to move it elsewhere. Mr. Lucy traveled to Zurich and met with about 15 banks. None would take his money, according to his court testimony. There was one exception. ""A couple of times the name Bank Frey came up as a bank that was new and aggressively seeking out accounts,"" he testified. (He didn't respond to requests for comment.) Sure enough, when Mr. Lucy showed up at Bank Frey's offices, Mr. Buck said he would open him an account. Mr. Lucy was impressed by Mr. Buck's assurances that his bank had nothing to worry about in the American tax-evasion investigations. ""I had found what I was looking for,"" Mr. Lucy said. Mr. Lucy said that Mr. Buck arranged for him to get a Matterhorn-emblazoned debit card that didn't have Bank Frey's or Mr. Lucy's names on it. Mr. Lucy was told that, when he needed money, he should call Bank Frey and ask them to load money onto the debit card. He could use it at any ATM. Mr. Lucy wanted to bring some account documentation back to New York. He said Mr. Buck advised him not to take anything with Bank Frey's name on it. (Mr. Buck denies giving that advice.) Mr. Lucy took a pair of scissors and snipped Bank Frey's name and logo off the paperwork. Back in Manhattan, Mr. Lucy bought a prepaid phone card for his calls to Zurich. He made them from a pay phone outside his apartment building. When that phone was damaged, the only other functioning pay phone he could find nearby was inside the kitchen of a boutique hotel. Surrounded by the kitchen's hubbub, he chatted on the phone with his Swiss banker. By the turn of the decade, other Swiss banks were booting their American customers — and handing them glossy Bank Frey brochures on the way out the door. Mr. Buck, who eventually rose to be Bank Frey's head of private banking, said he felt he wasn't doing anything wrong. All the same, he warned one client, Christine Warsaw, against sending banking instructions through the United States Postal Service, she said in court. ""No USPS, use fax,"" she wrote in a note to herself. Mr. Buck said he didn't tell her not to send materials through the mail. By 2011, it was dangerous for Americans to keep their money in undeclared offshore accounts. More banks were handing over client lists to the Justice Department. If you showed up on a list, prosecutors might pursue you. A safer option was to turn yourself in to the I.R.S. through a voluntary self-disclosure program. It allowed taxpayers to pay back taxes, cooperate with investigators and move on with their lives. Ms. Butrus closed her Bank Frey account and eventually declared the money to the I.R.S. She paid her taxes and a stiff penalty and pledged to help the I.R.S. and prosecutors. Mr. Lucy did, too. On disclosure forms, both identified Mr. Buck as their relationship manager. Prosecutors were hunting for bankers to hold accountable. The theory was that bankers knew they were enabling Americans to break the law and therefore were part of a conspiracy to defraud the United States government. Prosecutors turned to people including Ms. Butrus and Mr. Lucy. By 2013, more than 20 employees of Swiss financial institutions had been criminally charged. At least a dozen pleaded guilty and received a fine, probation or both. Several hunkered down in Switzerland, which refused to extradite its citizens to the United States for actions that weren't illegal in Switzerland. None had actually gone on trial. At 5 o'clock one morning in April 2013, Mr. Buck was awakened by a phone call. Bank Frey's chief executive was on the line. ""Go look at Bloomberg,"" Mr. Buck recalls him saying, referring to the business-news service. ""I'm sleeping,"" Mr. Buck said he replied. ""Do it now,"" his boss ordered. Mr. Buck pulled out his cellphone. There it was: an article saying he had been indicted. Terrified, Mr. Buck skimmed the indictment. The indictment made clear that his former clients were assisting the government. ""It was surreal,"" Mr. Buck said. Mr. Buck, 32 years old at the time and single, went to work to hand in his I.D. card and cellphone. He was placed on paid leave; the bank would cover his legal expenses. Then Mr. Buck headed to his sister's house. It was her husband's birthday, and they were hosting a barbecue. His sister, Sylvia Muther, was nearly nine months pregnant. ""We were scared he'd go to jail,"" she said. ""We tried not to think about that."" ""I got hammered,"" Mr. Buck said. Mr. Buck spent months weighing his options. He could plead guilty and be done with it. He could spend the rest of his life in Switzerland, which wouldn't extradite him. Or he could fight the charges. That third road was perilous. If Mr. Buck won at trial, he would be free — and the Justice Department's fight against bankers who enable tax evasion would be dealt a serious blow. If he lost, he was looking at up to five years in prison. In October 2014, one of UBS's top executives, Raoul Weil, went on trial in Florida. Federal prosecutors accused him of helping clients hide billions. Mr. Weil's lawyers argued he had no knowledge of or responsibility for what had happened. The jury deliberated for barely an hour before acquitting him. The same week, a Los Angeles jury acquitted an Israeli banker who faced similar accusations. The Americans' pursuit of foreign bankers no longer looked invincible. A few months later, on a cloudy morning in January 2015, Mr. Buck was skiing with friends in the Swiss Alps. Above the tree line, they started their descent. A sign on the slope marked the boundary between France and Switzerland. Mr. Buck realized he was crossing an international border — and that meant he theoretically could be picked up on an American arrest warrant in France. ""I was scared,"" Mr. Buck said. He told his friends to continue without him. He snapped off his skis, trudged back up the slope and skied down the Swiss side of the mountain. Mr. Buck realized he couldn't spend the rest of his life fearful of crossing a border. ""There was no way I was just going to stay in Switzerland,"" he said. Mr. Buck told his lawyer, Marc A. Agnifilo, that he wanted his day in court. On Nov. 9, 2016, Mr. Buck boarded a flight to New York. He had spent the previous two nights too scared to sleep. Mr. Agnifilo had negotiated with Manhattan prosecutors to let Mr. Buck out on bail once he arrived. The catch was that he would have to stay in the United States, with his passport confiscated, until his trial. ""Do you have any idea when I'm going to come back?"" he asked Mr. Agnifilo. ""No,"" his lawyer responded. ""Hopefully you don't have a cat you need to feed."" An I.R.S. agent collected Mr. Buck as he exited the plane in New York. He was fingerprinted, photographed, shackled and driven to a prison next to the Brooklyn Bridge. He spent the night with a cellmate whose hedge fund had been raided that morning by agents with machine guns. The next day, Mr. Buck pleaded not guilty and was released on bail. He moved into an Upper East Side apartment, paid for by Bank Frey, which by then had ceased operations, its business model seemingly up in smoke. It would be months before his trial was scheduled. Mr. Buck made the most of the free time. He trained in Central Park for the New York City Marathon. He became a Yankees fan. For New Year's, he went to Miami with friends. Since he had no I.D., he couldn't fly; instead he spent 33 hours on a Greyhound. ""He sees it all as an adventure,"" Mr. Agnifilo said. He spent much of his time in Mr. Agnifilo's 26th-floor law offices, helping his lawyers translate German-language documents. The crux of the defense was that the responsibility to pay taxes and declare income did not rest with Mr. Buck. It was his clients who had decided not to pay taxes. He was under no obligation to tattle; in fact, he was prohibited from doing so by Swiss bank-secrecy laws. Trial preparations dragged on, partly because Mr. Agnifilo also was representing Martin Shkreli, the hedge fund manager who eventually would be convicted of fraud. Mr. Buck had heard of Mr. Shkreli. He hadn't realized they would be sharing a lawyer. Mr. Agnifilo and Mr. Buck both recall shouting matches over whether the lawyer was sufficiently devoted to his client's case. Mr. Buck's trial started in October. Prosecutors branded him as a crucial cog in an international tax-evasion scheme. Mr. Agnifilo decided that Mr. Buck shouldn't testify. While the defendant was confident of his innocence, the cross-examination promised to be brutal. And Mr. Buck's English was imperfect. Jurors heard from a parade of Mr. Buck's former clients, including Ms. Butrus and Mr. Lucy. They testified that Mr. Buck and Bank Frey had been instrumental in allowing them to dodge taxes. ""We didn't want anyone, specifically the I.R.S., to find out we had an account at the time,"" Ms. Butrus testified. Prosecutors said all the secrecy — the nameless debit cards, the scissored bank paperwork, the shadowy phone calls — showed Mr. Buck knew what he was doing was wrong. ""These are techniques used by a person who is trying to keep from getting caught, not by a person who thinks he's operating legally,"" said Sarah E. Paul, an assistant United States attorney, near the end of the trial. Then it was Mr. Agnifilo's turn. ""At the center of the crime scene, there is an American with a pen,"" he intoned. ""Stefan Buck has nothing whatsoever, nothing whatsoever, to do with the choice that an American taxpayer makes"" to not declare offshore assets. Mr. Agnifilo said the fact that Mr. Buck came to America, rather than staying in Switzerland, confirmed that he had nothing to hide. ""Let Mr. Buck go back to Switzerland,"" he finished. It was a moving performance. ""I'm close to crying the first time in 25 years,"" Mr. Buck wrote on a Post-it note he handed his lawyers. The judge, Jed S. Rakoff, also was impressed. ""I knew you were a powerful orator,"" he told Mr. Agnifilo after the jury left, ""but you have exceeded all bounds."" The jury deliberated for a little more than a day. On Nov. 21, Mr. Buck was sitting on a toilet in the courthouse bathroom when the verdict came in. He hustled to the courtroom. A pair of United States Marshals hovered at the back. ""Are they here for me?"" Mr. Buck recalled asking his lawyer. No, Mr. Agnifilo fibbed. He knew the marshals were there to take Mr. Buck into custody if he was found guilty. The jury filed in and delivered the verdict: not guilty. Afterward, Mr. Buck spoke to the jurors in the hallway — the first time they had heard his voice. ""Happy Thanksgiving,"" he told them. Mr. Buck's acquittal reverberated through the legal community. The Justice Department had now lost the three cases it had tried against foreign bankers who helped Americans avoid taxes. Dozens more cases are pending. Those who represent accused Swiss bankers say they expect Mr. Buck's verdict to embolden defendants and to cause prosecutors to think twice before bringing new charges. ""It should change their calculus,"" said Marc S. Harris, a lawyer at Scheper Kim & Harris, who successfully defended the Israeli banker in 2014. He said the cases represented a ""misguided effort"" by the Justice Department to respond to political pressure to prosecute bankers. In early December, Mr. Buck's family and friends greeted him at the Zurich airport with a giant welcome-home poster. His priority was to get to the Alps for peak ski season. ""The timing of my return is perfect,"" he said. He hopes to get back to work soon in the Swiss finance industry."
Op-Ed,2018-01-06,"If there was one thing that doomed the Republican proposals to remake health care last year, it was the great uncertainty about how they would cover patients with chronic illness and pre-existing conditions.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/opinion/sunday/diabetes-shouldnt-bankrupt-you.html,1230," If there was one thing that doomed the Republican proposals to remake health care last year, it was the great uncertainty about how they would cover patients with chronic illness and pre-existing conditions. Throngs of people with a wide range of ailments staged dramatic protests in and around the halls of Congress during the debate. Night after night, Jimmy Kimmel, whose infant son was born with a serious congenital heart defect, took up the cause on his talk show. Only one in five people approved of the last failed Republican bill, Graham-Cassidy. A big reason: 87 percent of respondents, including 79 percent of Republicans, said in one poll that insurers should be required to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The bill could have allowed insurers in certain states to charge more for such coverage. Who doesn't have a family member or friend with a long-term or potentially recurring medical condition, whose life is maintained by expensive treatments — patients with diseases like Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, heart failure, cystic fibrosis and cancer? They are grateful for medical innovations that allow them to lead long, productive lives but afraid of financial ruin or an inability to get good coverage. But there is one large group of patients whom the federal government long ago effectively immunized against these now-widespread fears. Through a quiet act of Congress in 1972, people on dialysis with end-stage kidney failure can gain automatic Medicare coverage. When the law passed, dialysis patients probably seemed pretty exceptional: They needed a lifesaving treatment, at a potentially bankrupting price, for the rest of their lives. But today people with many diseases fit that description. That's why, as the United States attempts to rein in its $3 trillion annual medical bill and revamp its health care system, any plan must involve a solution for people with serious chronic illness, like the one developed for kidney failure almost half a century ago. ""This is an increasingly important issue as we get better at treatments and the risk and costs of chronic illnesses get more predictable,"" said Mark McClellan, a former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration under President George W. Bush, who is now a professor of business, medicine and policy at Duke University. The high cost of treating chronic illnesses poses a problem for every country. In the United States, it once meant that commercial insurers rejected such patients or charged them sky-high rates. The Affordable Care Act made such practices illegal, but even now insured people with chronic illnesses often face unaffordable costs in an era of high deductibles and co-payments. With varying success, other countries have found their own solutions, though mostly starting from different places. ""If you have a chronic disease, you shouldn't be burdened by the cost,"" said York F. Zöllner, professor of health economics at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, explaining the German approach. ""It's not your fault."" He and others note that conventional insurance is meant to cover unpredictable costs. But the costs of chronic illnesses are predictably high. Germany offers people with chronic disease better-than-standard coverage. Every German is required to have insurance — and guaranteed access to it — typically through more than 100 public nonprofit insurers. People can pick which ""sickness fund"" to join, and the system is financed through a ""contribution"" equal to roughly 15 percent of their income — nearly half coming from their employer and the rest from their paycheck. The total payment is capped at about 650 euros per month for adults, which includes coverage for dependent relatives. While co-payments exist — for prescriptions and hospital stays, for example — they are capped at 2 percent of gross earnings, and people with chronic disease pay half of that, according to Dr. Zöllner, with their out-of-pocket spending on health cost capped at 1 percent of income. Since expensive prescription drugs are a big component of many treatments, Germany's state health insurers have been negotiating prices with drugmakers since 2011, and drug prices there are generally lower than in the United States. The patient contribution for any prescription is five to 10 euros. Kaitlyn West, an American with Type 1 diabetes who recently moved to Germany for graduate school, said that in the United States she had been paying on average $400 per month in out-of-pocket expenses — close to $5,000 each year. The amount fluctuated wildly depending on how her insurance policy at the moment covered her pumps and medicines. On German public insurance, the monthly contribution is about $105 and her yearly out-of-pocket spending is capped at about $140 for supplies and $45 for insulin. ""There are no fees for doctors' visits, no fees for my blood draws and no hassle getting things done,"" she said. ""This system allows me to live a normal, stress-free life."" The German health system is based on the principle of solidarity, not individuality, Dr. Zöllner said. But reframed to appeal to current American concerns, it might translate: ""There but for the grace of God go I,"" since at this point there are so many treatable chronic diseases. The congressional logic that led to the 1972 kidney-care exception could apply to any of those conditions. In the 1960s, outpatient dialysis clinics and kidney transplantation were relatively new and too expensive for most patients, leaving insurers and employers to make hard choices about whether to pay for treatment. Against that backdrop, kidney specialists and lobbyists, including from the National Kidney Foundation, pressed for funding of treatment. One protest featured a patient being connected to dialysis on the House floor. An amendment to a Social Security bill in 1972 allowed kidney patients to enroll in Medicare. ""It is one of the most interesting cases in health care because it's unique in how we treated a chronic condition,"" said Tonya Saffer, senior health policy director at the foundation. ""It's been lifesaving."" While protecting patients from death and financial ruin, the program has also come with lessons. Once people with kidney disease had Medicare coverage, outpatient dialysis centers popped up across the country to serve a new cohort of paying patients. As the business of medicine grew, treatment was progressively taken over by a small number of for-profit companies with which Medicare and commercial insurers have been locked in a perpetual tug-of-war over potentially exploitative billing. Dialysis centers, for example, were billing not just for the dialysis but also for expensive drugs that were sometimes overused. To prevent abuses, Medicare today reimburses dialysis by paying a set amount for each treatment session, with a typical limit of three per week, although advocates question whether that number is sufficient. This model, where providers get a ""bundled payment"" for each treatment session or a per-person payment for each month of care, could be used to cover all sorts of chronic diseases while controlling costs, whether through Medicare or not, Dr. McClellan said. In 1972, when Congress passed the amendment, many assumed that the kidney entitlement was a temporary measure, and that the United States would soon have some kind of national health system. But Richard Rettig, a historian of medicine, wrote that, in the end, it ""was added to Medicare because the moral cost of failing to provide lifesaving care was deemed to be greater than the financial cost of doing so."" Isn't that just as true now?"

In the fall, in meetings with potential clients in the San Francisco Bay Area, I became aware of a dangerous trend: Employers are turning to techniques that ""mask"" the gender of the candidates they interview — removing names from résumés and altering voices on phone calls, for example — with the hope that this will offer a quick fix to diversity failures. These gender-masking tools and the related trend of ""blind hiring"" have recently been chronicled in The New York Times and Wired, and discussed at tech conferences. One head of talent at a major financial services company told me she's getting up to five pitches a week for tools that can mask applicants' gender. My team is regularly told by potential clients in the Fortune 100 that they are already using tools to obscure gender in hiring. Yelp has tried using a voice disguiser on initial interview calls to hide applicants' gender. This is a misguided distraction from the hard work of evaluating and fixing the ways in which their cultures drive out the women who are actually hired. I understand the appeal of gender-masking for companies that are rightly concerned that bias could be eliminating qualified female candidates, especially in tech roles, where women are severely underrepresented. In 2016, a group of computer scientists compared acceptance rates for code written by women and men on the code repository GitHub. It found that developers accepted nearly 72 percent of code written by women when they did not know their gender. When it was revealed that women had written the code, acceptance rates fell to 62 percent. After reading this study, I suggested that using virtual reality — with candidates identifiable to interviewers only by avatar names — might be a promising way to keep sexism out of the hiring process. But it has become clear that masking is, at best, a partial solution. While it might allow more women to get through interview rounds, there is little evidence that it would get more women hired. In fact, the low-tech version of masking — removing names from résumés — has been tried, without much documented success. A Silicon Valley executive told me why this strategy failed at her company. First, the pool of female applicants was very small to start. Second, her team tended to discount a résumé with a gap that signaled it had been submitted by a woman who took time off for caregiving. A Stanford doctoral student, Sharon Jank, studied the gender-masking platform GapJumpers and came up with similar findings. Removing gender identifiers helped women through the first screening, but at traditional interviews, the positive effects were undone by hiring managers' biases. The biggest problem with gender is that it allows companies to ignore the challenges of making their environments more inclusive. And it sends a confusing message to candidates — after all, if an employer needs to use masking because hiring managers can't be trusted to be open to diversity, why would women believe they'll belong and be treated fairly even if they are ultimately hired? Gender-masking tools do nothing to address the culture of a company. One of the central reasons the number of women at tech companies remains so pitifully low is that these companies are not creating environments where women feel they can thrive. I often hear from women who won't even apply to certain companies because they believe they'll be rejected after revealing that they're mothers of young children or caregivers to relatives, or that they have no interest in spending late hours at company-sponsored Ping-Pong tournaments or gatherings at bars where lines of workplace propriety are often crossed. Sadly, they're not off base. Over the summer a hiring manager at a major media company my start-up works with discounted a strong senior software engineer candidate after she told him she'd work 10 to 12 hours a day but occasionally needed to work remotely so that she could pick up her child from day care. ""This isn't a nine-to-five organization,"" he responded. By not being masked, at least she learned that company would be a terrible fit for her. And what if her identity had been hidden? The hiring manager would have probably driven her from the job in a few months, wasting his time, her time and the company's resources. Well-meaning executives often ask me what female candidates want from prospective employers. The answer is, women want to feel that they can belong and thrive within an organization's culture. They don't want to pretend that they aren't moms or that they are comfortable with bonding activities built for and by men. Yes, half the battle is getting more women in the room, but the other half is assuring women they won't have to hide who they are when they show up."
News,2018-01-06,"SURAT, India — The immense popularity of Narendra Modi, India’s most dynamic prime minister in decades, has always rested on two legs: Hindu nationalism and his tantalizing promises to build on the country’s go-go economy.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/world/asia/india-modi-economy.html,1859," SURAT, India — The immense popularity of Narendra Modi, India's most dynamic prime minister in decades, has always rested on two legs: Hindu nationalism and his tantalizing promises to build on the country's go-go economy. That second leg is now looking a little shaky. In the last two years, India's consumer confidence has plummeted, construction has slowed, the fixed investment rate has fallen, many factories have shut down and unemployment has gone up. Fingers are pointing at Mr. Modi. Just about all economists agree that two of the prime minister's biggest policy gambles — abruptly voiding most of the nation's currency and then, less than a year later, imposing a sweeping new sales tax — have slowed India's meteoric growth. ""Things have been worsening, worsening, worsening,"" said Himanshu, an economics professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, who uses only one name. Still, the economy here is far from failing. The stock market continues to soar, major rail, road and port projects are unfolding across the country, and foreign investors poured $25.4 billion into India from April to September, up 17 percent from the period in 2016. The government on Friday predicted that the country's gross domestic product would grow by 6.5 percent in the 2017-18 financial year. While that is the lowest number the country has seen in four years, India's economy is one that most countries would love to have. But it does not feel that way to the huge number of Indians negatively affected by Mr. Modi's policies, and the grumbles are growing. So are social tensions, especially those that divide Hindus from Muslims, and upper caste from lower caste. The fear is that Mr. Modi is already beginning to lean more heavily on that first leg of his, Hindu nationalism, now that his economic strategy is losing some of its sheen. With 1.3 billion people, India is the world's most populous democracy. In 10 years, economic forecasters predict that India's economy will climb to third-largest in the world, behind only the United States and China. What happens here matters, and domestically, confidence is strained. How does the election work? Will Modi win? What are the main issues facing India and its 900 million voters? Even in Gujarat, the state considered the strongest of Mr. Modi's strongholds, where people have been cheering his rise for the past 20 years and line up in dusty fields by the thousands just to catch a glimpse of his saffron scarf and groomed white beard, many feel betrayed. The output from the textile industry, a huge employer here and once a healthy exporter, has been cut nearly in half, prompting layoffs and despair. In many of the industrial areas, the happiest merchants are the merchants of scrap, who make their rounds in lurching trucks, scooping up looms, steel spools and other underused machinery for pennies on the dollar. In December, in an election that the entire country was watching because it was seen as a referendum on Mr. Modi's governance, Gujarati voters elected a new State Assembly. Mr. Modi's party maintained its majority but lost 16 seats. The message was clear: Mr. Modi's party was still No. 1, but the man himself was no longer bulletproof. ""Modi hurt our business, and we want to show him that we can hurt him, too,"" said Manish Patel, whose once clackety cloth factory is now completely empty, another Gujarati business that has gone under. Mr. Patel complained that under Mr. Modi, ""It was like we were in first class and now we've been put in 10th class."" So for the first time in his life, Mr. Patel voted for the Indian National Congress, the leading opposition party, not for the Bharatiya Janata Party of Mr. Modi. Here in Surat, a Gujarati metropolis with hundreds of years of storied mercantile history, Mr. Modi's currency policy hit like a sledgehammer. It was November 2016, and when Mr. Modi abruptly announced that large denomination rupee notes were invalid and being replaced with new currency, panic erupted. Manish Patel and his older brother, Dilip, who run the family's cloth business, found themselves scurrying into line at the bank and waiting hours each day, trying to get money. It was never enough, and when the brothers could not pay their loom operators, many walked off. Hundreds of factories had the same problem. The Surat textile traders association said production in this area dropped to 25 million meters a day now from 40 million meters two years ago. It's hard to overstate how central cash is to Gujarat, and India in general. Most laborers, whether they operate looms, drive trucks, wash clothes or haul bricks, are paid in stacks of soft rupee notes, Mahatma Gandhi's face on each one. Even large real estate deals, say for a home that costs the equivalent of $500,000 or $600,000, will be done partly in blocks of rupees, to keep profits off the books. This was what motivated Mr. Modi, who has made fighting corruption a big plank in his platform. He said that by making people turn in old bank notes, he would capture billions of rupees of so-called black money. It has never been made clear how much black money he actually captured, and perhaps he thought he could get away with the enormous disruption because India's economy had been doing so well. It expanded at more than 8 percent annually between 2005 and 2009 and more than 7 percent between 2010 and 2014. But his timing seems to have been bad. Unlike many of the other big economies that turn on exports — such as China's, Japan's or Germany's — India is not nearly as industrialized. Mr. Modi has vowed to change this, launching a Make in India campaign to attract foreign investors. But analysts say that India's labor laws are still too restrictive, imposing all kinds of red tape on factories of more than 100 workers, which discourages businesses from thinking big. ""A manufacturing revolution is nowhere in sight,"" one commentator recently said. India's economy remains substantially influenced by domestic rural demand. And back-to-back droughts in 2014 and 2015 ruined millions of farmers, slowing down overall growth. Then in July 2017, before people had a chance to recover from the currency chaos — which had also hampered consumption, because many Indians simply didn't have any spare cash in their pockets — Mr. Modi moved ahead on another front: the new goods and services tax, or G.S.T. It was the most sweeping tax overhaul India had ever tried, and probably overdue. But many economists and business people questioned Mr. Modi's timing on this as well. Suddenly, with the economy softening, all but the smallest businesses had to file dozens of returns each year, online, paying taxes on everything from yarn to mixed nuts, often at confusing rates. Business owners like the Patels, who had run their factory off a calculator and a paper pad, said they had no idea how to file. ""You need a computer; you need to buy online time; you need to hire someone who knows how to do it,"" Manish Patel lamented. ""All this costs money."" Many small businesses began to suffer from something they did not understand. ""G.S.T., G.S.T., what is this G.S.T.?"" said Bharat Bhai Kavad, who works out of his house in Surat with his wife and daughter sewing lace on garments for a big textile company. ""I didn't know at first what this G.S.T. was, and now it's come from Delhi to Gujarat to Surat to my house."" Because the Kavad family's lace work is unregistered and informal — they get paid a few rupees for each lace they attach — they cannot produce the proper receipts bigger companies need to comply with new tax rules. The Kavads' earnings have been cut in half. This is one point that many people here make: The informal economy feeds the formal; the two are inextricably linked. ""The informal sector is a very important part of the economy, a bridge, a foundation of the economy,"" said Mr. Himanshu, the economics professor. ""And then you attack them?"" Politics are shaped by expectation, and many Indians said they expected more from Mr. Modi. About one million Indians enter the work force every month, and job creation is one of the country's most urgent political priorities. Mr. Modi has come nowhere near his promise of creating 10 million jobs a year. The unemployment rate was 5 percent, the worst in five years, in 2015-16. Some studies show that at best, a few hundred thousand jobs have been created each year under Mr. Modi in major industries such as textiles, transportation and information technology, though this excludes the informal sector, where millions of Indians traditionally work. India's economy still has a lot going for it: It is already huge, and still growing relatively fast. It has an educated work force; a young, working-age population; and a public that craves new technology. Facebook has 217 million monthly active users in India, second only to the United States. Economic growth is projected to be higher next year, and Mr. Modi's supporters say that as India's economy matures, some sort of slowdown was inevitable. And it is not as if his base has fragmented. For every Gujarati business owner who wants to send Mr. Modi an angry message, many others are still with him. This was the area where Mr. Modi built his commanding brand as the state's top politician for 13 years before becoming prime minister in 2014, and where he attracted heavy manufacturing and investment. But for many people here, politics and economics are not connected at the hip. Kailash Dhoot, a textile exporter, said that Mr. Modi's recent policies had wounded his business but that Mr. Modi's party was still his first choice. When asked why, Mr. Dhoot was quick, and curt, with an answer. ""Hindutva,"" he said. And he closed his mouth firmly, signaling the discussion was over. Hindutva is a philosophy adopted by Mr. Modi's party that emphasizes Hindu supremacy. Since Mr. Modi came to power, so-called cow vigilantes have brutalized or killed dozens of people, many Muslim, for slaughtering or trading cows, a venerated animal in the Hindu religion. The hate crimes seem to never end. Analysts fear that if the economy continues to come up short of expectations, Mr. Modi might turn more to what are termed ""communal issues,"" subjects that divide communities based on religion or caste. ""If economic maneuverability is limited,"" said Ashutosh Varshney, a political-science professor and India specialist at Brown University, ""then the communal card, the Hindu-Muslim card, is a massive political temptation."" ""That's what Mr. Modi did in Gujarat,'' Professor Varshney said. ""He twisted every available political possibility into a Hindu-Muslim question."" One example was Mr. Modi's accusations that opposition leaders were in cahoots with Pakistan, India's rival and a nation with a strong Islamic identity, after some opposition leaders met some Pakistani officials at a recent social event. Many people saw those claims as a low blow to stir up Gujarati Hindus, who make up the state's vast majority. ""It didn't used to be like this,"" said Hanif Belim, a taxi driver in Gujarat. But nowadays, he added, ""politicians divide the public and sit on the side and watch them fight."""

News,2018-01-07,"LIMA, Peru — In his first comments since being released from the hospital on a medical pardon that drew wide condemnation, former President Alberto Fujimori of Peru called on the country to set aside its “grudges” in order to unite.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/world/americas/alberto-fujimori-peru.html,779," LIMA, Peru — In his first comments since being released from the hospital on a medical pardon that drew wide condemnation, former President Alberto Fujimori of Peru called on the country to set aside its ""grudges"" in order to unite. Mr. Fujimori, 79, made the comments on Twitter on Saturday amid an unabating furor over President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's decision to free him. The former strongman had served 12 years of a 25-year prison sentence for graft and human rights crimes. On Twitter, he reflected on the new chapter in his life and urged Peruvians to come together to fight violence and crime. ""In the first hours of this new stage of my life, several dreams invade me constantly, and I would like to share them,"" Mr. Fujimori said in a tweet. ""I wish for a Peru without grudges, with all of us working toward a superior objective."" Then, in an apparent appeal to his right-wing political base, he added: ""We'll be a country in which security is regained and violence is eliminated. We can fulfill these goals by setting aside special interests and opportunism. UNITED WE CAN ACHIEVE THEM!"" It was unclear if Mr. Fujimori's remarks were a hint that he planned to play a more active role in Peruvian politics. But the message rippled across Peru, where Mr. Fujimori is a deeply divisive figure. Though respected by some, he has been vilified for leading an administration that led a violent crackdown in the 1990s on the Maoist Shining Path insurgency, which had all but brought normal life in Peru to a standstill with bombings and killings. In 2009, Mr. Fujimori was sentenced for his role in two massacres that killed dozens of Peruvians in its effort to quash the Shining Path. Peru, a country with an authoritarian past, returned to democracy only 17 years ago. And critics denounced Mr. Kuczynski's pardon as a blow to the fight against impunity and efforts to heal national wounds after Mr. Fujimori's presidency. The Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa and 238 other writers signed an open letter saying the decision covered the nation ""in infamy and shame."" The letter said the pardon was not an act of compassion, as the government insisted, but ""the most crude and cynical political calculus."" But Prime Minister Mercedes Aráoz wrote an op-ed article published in the Lima daily El Comercio on Sunday defending Mr. Kuczynski's decision to pardon Mr. Fujimori. ""Dear countrymen,"" she wrote, ""this pardon does not in any way mean impunity or oblivion; this is about starting to heal our wounds as a country."" Mr. Kuczynski, 79, a former Wall Street banker who took office in July 2016, has been hanging on to power, having narrowly survived a motion in Congress last month to impeach him. He had been accused of lying during an inquiry about possible ties to the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht, which was engulfed in a graft scandal. It was later revealed that a financial services company Mr. Kuczynski owned had received $782,000 from Odebrecht, a disclosure that set off the impeachment effort. Many had expected the vote to result in his removal, with the chamber dominated by the opposition Popular Force, a right-wing party founded by Mr. Fujimori's daughter, Keiko, who supported the effort to impeach Mr. Kuczynski. But at the last minute, a faction of the Popular Force led by Mr. Fujimori's younger son, Kenji, challenged his sister and swung the vote in Mr. Kuczynski's favor. Some lawmakers said that Mr. Fujimori had asked them to follow his son's lead, and the pardon was widely seen as a quid pro quo with Mr. Kuczynski, charges the administration has denied. In signs of a split in Popular Force, Kenji Fujimori has accused his sister of ""conspiring"" to keep his father imprisoned. He has asked that his father be named an aide to the family-run party. ""On the one hand, there's Keiko and her bloc that directly opposes the government,"" said Gilbert Violeta, a congressman who is president of Mr. Kuczynski's party, Peruvians for Change. ""On the other hand, there's Kenji and the bloc that supports Alberto Fujimori."" ""We will only know the real effects of that confrontation in the following days, when Congress is back in session,"" Mr. Violeta added. Lawyers say there is no legal obstacle preventing Mr. Fujimori from seeking public office now that he has regained his freedom. Before he was wheeled from the hospital, he asked for Peruvians' forgiveness ""with all my heart"" in a Facebook video. Since then, he has spent his days inside a rented house in a quiet suburb of the Peruvian capital, Lima, where his doctors say he is recovering from a heart condition."
News,2018-01-07,"Last May, Jared Kushner accompanied President Trump, his father-in-law, on the pair’s first diplomatic trip to Israel, part of Mr. Kushner’s White House assignment to achieve peace in the Middle East.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/business/jared-kushner-israel.html,1380," Last May, Jared Kushner accompanied President Trump, his father-in-law, on the pair's first diplomatic trip to Israel, part of Mr. Kushner's White House assignment to achieve peace in the Middle East. Shortly before, his family real estate company received a roughly $30 million investment from Menora Mivtachim, an insurer that is one of Israel's largest financial institutions, according to a Menora executive. The deal, which was not made public, pumped significant new equity into 10 Maryland apartment complexes controlled by Mr. Kushner's firm. While Mr. Kushner has sold parts of his business since taking a White House job last year, he still has stakes in most of the family empire — including the apartment buildings in and around Baltimore. The Menora transaction is the latest financial arrangement that has surfaced between Mr. Kushner's family business and Israeli partners, including one of the country's wealthiest families and a large Israeli bank that is the subject of a United States criminal investigation. The business dealings don't appear to violate federal ethics laws, which require Mr. Kushner to recuse himself only from narrow government decisions that would have a ""direct and predictable effect"" on his financial interests. And no evidence has emerged that Mr. Kushner was personally involved in brokering the deal. But the deal last spring illustrates how the Kushner Companies' extensive financial ties to Israel continue to deepen, even with his prominent diplomatic role in the Middle East. The arrangement could undermine the ability of the United States to be seen as an independent broker in the region. The Trump administration already inflamed tensions there when it said last month that it recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and would move the United States Embassy there from Tel Aviv. ""I think it's reasonable for people to ask whether his business interests are somehow affecting his judgment,"" said Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale in Washington who specializes in government ethics and was general counsel to Senator Rand Paul's presidential campaign. Raj Shah, a deputy White House press secretary, said the Trump administration has ""tremendous confidence in the job Jared is doing leading our peace efforts, and he takes the ethics rules very seriously and would never compromise himself or the administration."" Christine Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Kushner Companies, said the company has partners around the world. It ""does no business,"" she said, ""with foreign sovereigns or governments, and is not precluded from doing business with any foreign company simply because Jared is working in the government."" Menora, which is also Israel's largest manager of pension funds, has done numerous other real estate deals, including several in the United States, said the Menora executive, Ran Markman, who is the company's head of real estate. He said he had never met Mr. Kushner. In negotiating the deal with Kushner Companies, Mr. Markman said, he worked with Laurent Morali, the firm's president. The deal was ""not done because of the so-called connections of Jared Kushner or Donald Trump,"" Mr. Markman said. ""The connection to the president was not an issue. It didn't make us do the deal, it didn't make us not do the deal."" Mr. Kushner resigned as chief executive of Kushner Companies when he joined the White House last January. But he remains the beneficiary of a series of trusts that own stakes in Kushner properties and other investments. Those are worth as much as $761 million, according to government ethics filings, and most likely much more: The estimate nets out the significant debt accumulated by the firm, which has done about $7 billion of deals in the past decade. The Baltimore-area buildings in which Menora invested were the subject of an article by a ProPublica reporter in the The New York Times Magazine last year that documented the poor living conditions and aggressive tactics used by Kushner Companies, including garnishing the bank accounts of low-income tenants and turning off heat and hot water. The White House has said Mr. Kushner would work with his ethics advisers to ensure he recused himself from ""any particular matter involving specific parties in which he has a business relationship with a party to the matter."" But a White House official also said Mr. Kushner had sold stakes in properties that would present unique complexity. For example, he sold his stake in the company's headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which is seeking new investors around the world. It is unclear why Mr. Kushner hasn't applied that same principle to the buildings in Maryland that received an investment from Menora. Abbe D. Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Kushner, said in a statement: ""Jared Kushner has not been involved in, nor spoken about any Kushner Companies' activities or project, since shortly before the Inauguration. He has an ethics agreement, reviewed by lawyers, with which he is in full compliance. Connecting any of his well-publicized trips to the Middle East to anything to do with Kushner Companies or its businesses is nonsensical and is a stretch to write a story where none actually exists."" But Mr. Sanderson, the lawyer who specializes in government ethics, said, ""Their standard seems like some version of 'It's a conflict when I think it's a conflict, and I'll make that judgment myself.'"" One issue, said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a nonprofit government ethics group, is that ""the ethics laws were not crafted by people who had the foresight to imagine a Donald Trump or a Jared Kushner."" ""No one could ever imagine this scale of ongoing business interests, not in a local peanut farm or a hardware store but sprawling global businesses that give the president and his top adviser personal economic stakes in an astounding number of policy interests,"" Mr. Weissman added. The deal with Menora is one of many financial relationships that Kushner Companies has in Israel. In April, The Times reported that the Kushners had teamed up with at least one member of Israel's wealthy Steinmetz family to buy nearly $200 million of Manhattan apartment buildings, as well as to build a luxury rental tower in New Jersey. The family's best-known member, Beny Steinmetz, is the subject of a United States Justice Department bribery investigation. Mr. Steinmetz has denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Kushner's company has also taken out at least four loans from Israel's largest bank, Bank Hapoalim, which is the subject of a Justice Department investigation over allegations that it helped wealthy Americans evade taxes. The firm also bought several floors of the former New York Times headquarters building in Manhattan from Lev Leviev, an Israeli businessman and philanthropist. And the Kushner family's foundation continues to donate money to a settlement group in the West Bank. Mr. Kushner's close relationship with Israeli officials has even come up in the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Michael T. Flynn, the former Trump national security adviser, spoke with the Russian ambassador ahead of a United Nations Security Council vote to condemn Israel's building of settlements in late 2016, according to court documents filed by Mr. Mueller's office. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel had asked the Trump transition team to lobby other countries to help Israel, according to people briefed on the inquiry. A ""very senior member"" of the presidential transition team directed Mr. Flynn to discuss the resolution, the court documents said. Mr. Trump's lawyers believe that unnamed aide was Mr. Kushner, according to a lawyer briefed on the matter. ""A lot of people wonder whether the United States has ever been an honest broker in the Middle East, and given the positions of the Trump administration, it's probably even more vulnerable to those claims,"" said Richard W. Painter, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush and is a professor at the University of Minnesota law school. Now, the United States is ""sending over a special envoy who has already identified himself personally more with the hawkish views,"" Mr. Painter said, and ""he is getting money from wealthy citizens and businesses in one particular country."" Mr. Painter added: ""You've got a situation that is going to be abused by people who don't like the United States. He's going to make it that much worse."""
News,2018-01-07,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s supporters moved aggressively on Sunday to counter revelations in a new book that some of his closest aides believe he is unstable and ill equipped for office, an assault that prompted the source of some of the most damning accusations, Stephen K. Bannon, to issue a striking mea culpa.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/us/politics/stephen-miller-cnn-trump-bannon-apology.html,1676," WASHINGTON — President Trump's supporters moved aggressively on Sunday to counter revelations in a new book that some of his closest aides believe he is unstable and ill equipped for office, an assault that prompted the source of some of the most damning accusations, Stephen K. Bannon, to issue a striking mea culpa. The multipronged attack, punctuated by a heated appearance on a Sunday talk show by a top White House adviser who was once a close ally of Mr. Bannon, was a sign of how the White House has been reeling from the allegations. The adviser, Stephen Miller, who had been aligned with Mr. Bannon in pushing the president's nationalist agenda, derided him on Sunday as a fame-seeking blowhard and the book, ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,"" by Michael Wolff, as a work of fiction. Soon after came a rare and lengthy statement of repentance from Mr. Bannon, who over the last week found himself isolated from his political allies and cut off from his financial patrons. Speaking out five days after he was quoted harshly criticizing the president and his eldest son, a delay he said he regretted, Mr. Bannon tried to reverse his statements completely, calling Donald Trump Jr. ""both a patriot and a good man."" He is quoted in the book as calling the younger Mr. Trump's meeting with Russians in 2016 ""treasonous."" But in the statement on Sunday, first reported by Axios, he said his reference to ""treason"" had been aimed not at the president's son, but at another campaign official who attended the Trump Tower meeting, Paul Manafort. Calling Mr. Manafort ""a seasoned campaign professional with experience and knowledge of how the Russians operate,"" Mr. Bannon wrote that Mr. Manafort ""should have known they are duplicitous, cunning and not our friends."" Mr. Bannon is not known for second-guessing himself and views apologies as signs of weakness. Nowhere in his statement on Sunday did he actually say he was sorry. But the turn of events represented a stunning reversal of fortune for a man who once operated with such autonomy in the White House that, as chief strategist, he reported only to the president himself. And he reiterated his allegiance in his statement, saying, ""My support is also unwavering for the president and his agenda."" While the attack on Mr. Bannon may have prompted an unusual expression of contrition from him, the collective force of the attempts to defend the president also ensured that the questions about his mental fitness raised in the book will continue to command attention. This comes as Mr. Trump enters a critical period needing to pass legislation like a spending measure to keep the government open. The president returned to the White House on Sunday from Camp David, where he had held meetings with Republican leaders in Congress, cabinet officials and senior staff members to set priorities for the year. After an initial message on Twitter that focused on policy matters like border security, the opioid epidemic, infrastructure and the status of young undocumented immigrants, Mr. Trump joined the offensive against the book and the news media coverage of it. ""I've had to put up with the Fake News from the first day I announced that I would be running for President,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Now I have to put up with a Fake Book, written by a totally discredited author."" Mr. Bannon has been the target of derision by the president, who has labeled him ""Sloppy Steve"" and has said he played a far lesser role in Mr. Trump's political rise than he has been given credit for. Even out of favor, Mr. Bannon has said he remains a champion of the president's agenda. But Mr. Miller, the president's senior policy adviser, acidly criticized Mr. Bannon in an interview on CNN, calling his comments in the book ""out of touch with reality,"" ""vindictive"" and ""grotesque."" In a week that held one indignity after another for Mr. Bannon, who has fancied himself a revolutionary poised to tear down the Republican establishment, the words of Mr. Miller may have cut the deepest. Mr. Miller became a Bannon protégé of sorts during the time Mr. Miller worked for Attorney General Jeff Sessions when Mr. Sessions was in the Senate. He became one of the leading voices on the right calling for tighter controls on legal and illegal immigration. The two men shared not just a nationalist-tinged conservative view on policy but a desire for political provocation. Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump were delighted by and cheered on some of Mr. Miller's more infamous and combative episodes with the news media, like when he chastised a CNN reporter for displaying ""cosmopolitan bias"" in his understanding of the White House's immigration positions. Mr. Miller, however, bristled at the suggestion that he was a Bannon creation, a perception Mr. Bannon himself often encouraged. Mr. Bannon's allies understood the White House's moves this past week to be an act of ruthless political war much like Mr. Bannon himself might have waged during his time in the administration. They said they believed that the president and senior aides like Kellyanne Conway, who is close to Rebekah Mercer, the billionaire who issued a rare statement last week disavowing Mr. Bannon, were sending activists and donors a clear message: He is persona non grata in conservative politics. Ms. Mercer is a partial owner of Breitbart News, the hard-right website where Mr. Bannon is executive chairman but where his future is now in doubt. On Sunday, it was Mr. Miller who had the political leverage. He cast as false the perception that Mr. Bannon had ever played a Svengali-like role in the presidential campaign and the White House. He said Mr. Bannon's role had been ""greatly exaggerated,"" even as the CNN host Jake Tapper ticked off a long list of policies he said Mr. Bannon had played a key role in formulating. In ""Fire and Fury,"" Mr. Bannon said Mr. Trump had ""lost his stuff,"" and Mr. Miller also tried on Sunday to counter the concerns about the president's mental state. Echoing the president's own words from Saturday, he called Mr. Trump a ""political genius"" who could rattle off complete paragraphs on the fly in response to news events and then deliver them ""flawlessly"" to a campaign audience. The interview, on the program ""State of the Union,"" quickly grew heated as Mr. Tapper accused Mr. Miller of being ""obsequious"" and speaking to an ""audience of one."" Before it ended, Mr. Tapper told Mr. Miller that he was wasting his audience's time. Mr. Tapper then turned to the camera, even as Mr. Miller was still speaking, and cut to a commercial. A short time later, the president praised his aide on Twitter, saying that Mr. Miller had ""destroyed"" Mr. Tapper in the interview. In addition to assailing Mr. Bannon, Mr. Miller sharply criticized Mr. Wolff and his book, saying it ""is best understood as a work of very poorly written fiction."" Mr. Wolff, appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" stood by the accuracy of his book and contradicted the White House account of how often he had talked to the president. White House officials said their records showed that Mr. Wolff had last talked to the president in February, but Mr. Wolff said he had talked to the president several times after that. In all, Mr. Wolff said, he talked to the president for about three hours, which also included interviews during the campaign. He said that Mr. Trump had even initially flattered him about the project, and that he had told interview subjects that ""the president said he likes this idea"" of a book. Mr. Wolff also repeated an assertion in the book that many in the White House had talked about the possible invocation of the 25th Amendment, a constitutional provision that permits a president's powers to be transferred to the vice president when the vice president and a majority of the cabinet or a body created by Congress conclude that the president is incapable of performing his duties. ""This is alarming in every way,"" Mr. Wolff said, adding, ""This is worse than everybody thought."" Appearing on Sunday talk shows, others in Mr. Trump's inner circle dismissed any such worries. Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, said that he had no concerns about Mr. Trump's ability to receive and process the kind of intelligence typically presented to presidents, and that Mr. Wolff's descriptions of Mr. Trump's mental state were ""pure fantasy."" ""I'm with him almost every day,"" Mr. Pompeo said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""We talk about some of the most serious matters facing America and the world, complex issues. The president is engaged. He understands the complexity. He asks really difficult questions of our team at C.I.A."" Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who was briefly a rival to Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination and, until recently, had been a frequent critic of the president, joined his defenders on Sunday. ""I've enjoyed his company,"" he said on ""Meet the Press."" ""He beat me like a dog. I've said everything I know to say about him — I've used every adjective on the planet. I lost. He won."" ""I don't think he's crazy,"" Mr. Graham continued. ""I think he's had a very successful 2017. And I want to help him where I can. And we should all want him to be successful. He's got a lot on his plate."" With Republican control of the House and possibly the Senate at risk in 2018, Mr. Trump cannot afford another year dominated by news of West Wing dysfunction. ""The reality is people want the president to deliver, and this is a side show,"" said Sam Nunberg, a former aide to the Trump campaign who is now close with Mr. Bannon. Mr. Nunberg added that the president's disavowals of his former strategist would mean little to voters. ""The irony is the president is going to have a rude awakening when numerous candidates during the midterms respectfully decline his offer to campaign with them,"" he said."
News,2018-01-07,"STROUDSBURG, Pa. — For days, the pledges from Baruch College joining Pi Delta Psi had been ordered around by fraternity members and deprived of sleep.

And after they left New York City for a rental house in the Poconos in December 2013, they faced yet another test, a final gauntlet known as the ""glass ceiling,"" a ritual meant to represent their plight as Asian-American men. Other pledges had already crossed the frozen yard, blindfolded and wearing a backpack weighed down with sand, as fraternity members confronted them. But the last to go, Chun Hsien Deng, an 18-year-old freshman also known as Michael, had not been doing what he was told, and the other members responded aggressively. He was lifted up and dropped to the ground and tackled before he fell unconscious, prosecutors said. After he was taken to a hospital, doctors found he had sustained severe head trauma and his body was covered in bruises. Nearly two years after Mr. Deng's death, officials here in Monroe County announced dozens of criminal charges — assault, hindering apprehension, hazing. Five men were charged with third-degree murder. But prosecutors also took an unusual measure: they charged Pi Delta Psi itself with criminal counts that included third-degree murder, aggravated assault and conspiracy. The fraternity has argued that members were acting on their own, defying the organization's rules forbidding hazing. But prosecutors contended that the rituals were actually intrinsic to the fraternity's culture, a series of tests meant to humiliate prospective members as well as inculcate them with an understanding of their heritage as Asian-Americans and the adversity faced by their ancestors. It was a process, as prosecutors claimed in court records, that had been ""followed and repeated semester after semester for every colony or chapter."" The case, in which 37 people were charged, has been cited as evidence of prosecutors across the country becoming more aggressive in pursuing criminal charges when college students are killed from hazing. But by charging the fraternity, prosecutors here took what legal experts described as a rare step, one that has had limited success but stands to bring about more stringent and far-reaching consequences. Episodes involving students dying from hazing rituals have drawn increasing attention, driving universities and student organizations to respond by instituting educational programs and tightening rules surrounding the practice. But as students continue to die or get injured, anti-hazing advocates say more drastic action is vital and argue that criminal prosecutions, especially against the fraternities, could have a meaningful influence. ""This may actually send a message to the fraternities that they need to do more,"" said David W. Bianchi, a lawyer in Miami who, for two decades, has represented parents in lawsuits after their children were killed. In Mr. Deng's case, prosecutors have had some success: In November, a jury acquitted Pi Delta Psi of third-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter, but did find it guilty of other charges, including aggravated assault, involuntary manslaughter and hindering apprehension. The sentencing for the fraternity, as well as several of the men charged, is scheduled for Monday; the fraternity faces fines ranging from $2,000 to $25,000 for each charge, prosecutors said. (Baruch has permanently barred Pi Delta Psi). ""The fraternity has been held responsible for the senseless and completely avoidable death of a strong, smart, promising college freshman,"" Kimberly A. Metzger, the assistant district attorney who led the prosecution, said in a statement following the verdict. ""There is nothing that will ever lift the burden of Michael's tragic death from the hearts of his mother and father and their entire family,"" she added. ""But in speaking with Michael's mother following the verdict, she reiterated for us what she has consistently wished from this case — that another young person isn't subjected to such perverse conduct merely for wanting to belong."" One of the earliest and highest-profile cases of prosecutors charging a fraternity came after the death, in 1997, of Scott Krueger, an 18-year-old freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was pledging to join the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. He fell into a coma after binge drinking, his blood-alcohol level reaching 0.40, five times the legal limit to drive, prosecutors said. The fraternity was indicted on homicide and hazing charges, while no individual members were charged. The case fell apart after the fraternity dissolved its chapter at M.I.T. Another fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, was found guilty in 2012 of hazing and other charges after George Desdunes, a Cornell University sophomore from Brooklyn, died after drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. However, in that case, the fraternity did not present a defense; three students who were charged were acquitted. Prosecutors routinely pursue criminal cases against institutions, often for white-collar crimes involving allegations of corporate malfeasance. Charges alleging violent offenses are less common. Legal experts said the situation with fraternities is analogous to workplace cases, such as in mines or on construction sites, where prosecutors believe an employer's negligence or wrongdoing contributed to a worker's injury or death. In such cases, prosecutors have to show that the death was ""much more than pure possibility,"" said David LaBahn, the president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. ""This was a death that was preventable."" In the Baruch case, Pi Delta Psi has contended that the initiation rituals were unsanctioned. During the trial, the fraternity claimed that prosecutors had unfairly conflated the students' actions with organization's in a way that was ""misleading and directly prejudices the national fraternity."" ""A corporation can only act through a person,"" the fraternity argued in court documents, adding that there was ""no evidence presented"" showing that the national fraternity had representatives at the retreat, was involved in its planning or ""exhibited an intent to cause the tragic result."" That weekend in 2013, fraternity members from Baruch, a commuter school in Manhattan whose Pi Delta Psi colony was only about three years old, gathered in a large rental house in Tunkhannock Township, Pa. Early on a frigid morning, Mr. Deng followed the other pledges in putting on a blindfold and backpack. According to a grand jury report released in 2015, other fraternity members pushed him around; one of them ran into him from 15 feet away, with his head lowered, the report said. Mr. Deng was carried inside, unconscious, his body feeling like ""dead weight,"" the report said. Instead of immediately seeking medical aid, the authorities said, the other members changed his clothes and used their phones to search phrases like ""concussion can't wake up."" After about an hour, he was driven by fraternity members to a hospital, where he died the next day. Four of the men who initially faced murder charges pleaded guilty in May to voluntary manslaughter and hindering apprehension. In a statement, Mr. Deng's family has called for a ""punishment severe enough to forever remind them of the pain and grief we will carry for the rest of our lives as a result of their misconduct."" Mr. Bianchi said the significance of the jury's decision was the broader implications it could have, including alerting fraternities to the potential of being prosecuted. ""There has to be a consequence for this conviction,"" Mr. Bianchi said, noting the possibility of fines and other penalties. ""You can't put the institution in jail."""
News,2018-01-07,"When Desiree Santana’s 14-year-old daughter went missing in September, she felt frantic.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/nyregion/seeing-more-than-just-another-missing-teenager-from-the-bronx.html,925," When Desiree Santana's 14-year-old daughter went missing in September, she felt frantic. Ms. Santana filed a police report, but two days later she was still awaiting news. She called the local detective assigned to the case up to seven times a day, but her calls were not returned, she said. The precinct promised to send her daughter's picture to the press, but Ms. Santana never saw it on the local news. ""To them, she was just another missing teenager from the Bronx,"" Ms. Santana, 42, said during a recent interview at her childhood home in the western part of the borough. ""She seemed like just another kid who was disobedient and ran away."" But Ms. Santana, a single mother of six, refused to give up the search for her daughter, Sarah. Ms. Santana emailed her daughter's photograph to a local television reporter. Within minutes, she saw the picture on TV. She waited for answers, but none came. Three days after Sarah disappeared, Ms. Santana and her oldest daughter tracked her down through social media. Sarah had gone missing before, typically for a few hours. In the last two years, she has disappeared as frequently as once or twice a month, her mother said. Ms. Santana has called the police so often that when she walks down the block, officers ask about her daughter by name. ""They all know us,"" she said. Acknowledging the large number of missing persons cases churning through the system, Ms. Santana assumes that her many calls over the years have made her requests seem less urgent. Indeed, teenagers are the most common demographic among missing people in New York, according to the city's Police Department. Of the 225 cases of missing children 16 and younger open as of Friday, nearly two-thirds came from Brooklyn and the Bronx. Sarah's frequent disappearances have taken a toll on the family. ""I'm just like, when am I going to get to the bottom of what's going on with her?"" Ms. Santana asked. She said she focused on Sarah's needs at the expense of her other children, four of whom remain at home and range in age from 5 to 20. In the last two years, Sarah has been hospitalized every two months in two-week increments — the longest period covered by Ms. Santana's private insurance. Those hospitalizations, and the disappearances, have put a dent in Ms. Santana's finances. Ms. Santana, who makes $47,000 a year as a precertification counselor at Mount Sinai Hospital in the financial district in Manhattan, has had to take days off to search for and care for Sarah, exhausting her paid leave for three years running. In November 2015, she was granted unpaid leave through the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, allowing her to take time off without losing her job. The family's financial situation endured further strain in February, when Ms. Santana's oldest brother died of a heart attack. Paying for the funeral, which cost $5,000, fell to Ms. Santana, who receives $704 a month in food stamps and $494 a month in Social Security Disability Insurance for Sarah. By May, Ms. Santana was seven months behind on her rent and faced eviction from her apartment, just two floors below the apartment where her mother lives and where she had grown up. She went to housing court to request debt forgiveness but was denied. Ms. Santana reached out to Catholic Charities Community Services, a division of Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which took her case back to court and helped her reapply for emergency assistance. In June, the debt, which had grown beyond $10,000, was reduced by funds from several other organizations and the remainder forgiven through the Human Resources Administration's One Shot Deal. By October, Ms. Santana had again fallen behind on the rent, accruing almost $1,652 in arrears and late fees. Another month's rent loomed. Catholic Charities provided about $1,491 toward her balance, including $313 from the Neediest Cases Fund. With negotiations, the landlord agreed to forgive $700 in late fees. ""Now I'm back on my feet,"" Ms. Santana said. Now Sarah's situation is also looking up, Ms. Santana said. She had conducted online research, taken Sarah to therapists, and contacted the state's Health Department and the Bronx borough president for guidance about available services, but nothing seemed to work. Then, after Sarah disappeared again in October, Ms. Santana called and emailed the governor's office, explaining her family's situation and her frustration with a lack of resources for her daughter. She received a response within 24 hours, promising assistance. Three weeks later, with help from the state's Office of Mental Health, Sarah was moved from home to a rehabilitation center in Westchester County, where she now attends classes and is supervised to ensure that she does not run away. Her mother said she had hope that with the proper treatment, Sarah could excel. ""Now, she's excited when she comes from school,"" Ms. Santana said. ""She'll call and say, 'Mom, I got an A.' She's more focused now."" Ms. Santana has considered writing a book, she said on a recent fall day. ""But who would believe it?"" she said with a laugh. ""We could pour some wine and talk all day, and you'd either think, 'That can't possibly be true' or 'Let me get away from her — she's bad luck.'"" Ms. Santana's vision of a better future is wrapped up in the success of her children. ""I live for them,"" she said."
briefing,2018-01-07,Good morning. ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/briefing/north-korea-jerusalem-golden-globes.html,1226," Good morning. Here's what you need to know: • President Trump started 2018 with such a furious wave of Twitter posts — threatening North Korea and urging protesters to overthrow the Iranian government, to name just a few — that some worry that America's credibility is at risk. Two things stand out, our chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe writes: How far the tweets deviate from the way past presidents expressed themselves. And how rarely Mr. Trump has followed through on his words. Mr. Trump over the weekend dismissed questions about his mental fitness that were raised in a new book, calling himself a ""very stable genius."" _____ • North and South Korea start high-level talks on Tuesday aimed at easing tensions and allowing North Korean athletes to participate in the Winter Olympics next month. The talks could lead to a thaw in the tensions over the North's nuclear program, but President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has vowed to take a tough line in negotiations. And for decades, U.S. intelligence officials warned that the North was making progress on a missile that could reach the United States. But the last breakthroughs happened much faster than they had expected. _____ • In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity is eroding as the once-roaring economy cools down. Economists agree that two of Mr. Modi's biggest policy gambles — abruptly voiding most of the nation's currency and imposing a sweeping new sales tax — have slowed India's meteoric growth. Now that his economic strategy is losing its sheen, Mr. Modi may lean even more heavily on Hindu nationalism, a risky gambit as social tensions simmer, especially between Hindus and Muslims and among castes. _____ • President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital is seen by many as the death knell for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And even the Palestine Liberation Organization is asking if that might not be such a bad idea. But Israeli and Palestinian visions of what that single state would look like are mutually exclusive. Separately, the financial ties between Israel and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, continue to deepen, even with Mr. Kushner's diplomatic role in the Middle East. _____ • At almost twice the length of the U.S.-Mexico border, Australia's dingo fence is the longest in the world. The idea is simple: to keep feral dogs and dingoes from getting to sheep farms on the other side of the wire. But new research has raised questions about the fence's environmental impact, and new technology threatens to upend its traditional means of maintenance. Meanwhile, Sydney recorded its highest temperatures since 1939, with western areas hitting 117 degrees Fahrenheit, or 47 Celsius. _____ • The Golden Globes are Sunday night, the first major Hollywood gathering since the explosive revelations last year of sexual assault and harassment. Women attending have been asked to wear black on the red carpet, in solidarity with the #MeToo movement. Above, the actress Andrea Riseborough. In a series of essays, our reporters discuss whether the red carpet will ever be the same after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. The show starts at 8 p.m. Eastern, with Seth Meyers hosting. We'll have live coverage. _____ • Ripple is now the second-largest virtual currency behind Bitcoin. One of its founders even briefly overtook Mark Zuckerberg on the world's richest list with a worth of more than $59 billion. • ""So we're kicking off 2018 with a nightmare."" That was our tech reporter on the emergence of Meltdown and Spectre, two of the worst computer security flaws yet. • Several of Uber's early shareholders, including Travis Kalanick, its former chief executive, were said to be selling large chunks of stock to a consortium led by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate. • Here's a snapshot of global markets. • China and South Korea were searching for 32 sailors, including 30 Iranians, after their oil tanker collided with a freighter off China's east coast late Saturday.

Could computers be trained to predict death? • And an insatiable starfish species appears to be decimating the Great Barrier Reef. The culprit, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has an extrudable stomach that wraps around the coral to ingest it. When unrest erupted in Iran this month, President Trump used Twitter to directly reach out to anti-government protesters in dozens of towns. Such public outreach is a lot easier than it used to be. A hundred years ago today, President Woodrow Wilson, above, outlined his terms for an end to World War I in a speech meant to appeal to the war-weary people of America's European foes. American newspapers like The New York Times printed the 14-point speech in full, but that did not mean the average German would get the message. A few days later, a report in The Times documented efforts to spread the speech behind enemy lines, after Berlin threatened to execute pilots of planes distributing copies. ""What is now wanted is some kind of flying craft which will travel fifty to a hundred miles or more, dropping propaganda on the way,"" The Daily Chronicle, a British paper, reported. ""Here is a chance for ingenious inventors to improve on the existing facilities for invading the enemy countries with moral munitions and scattering broadcast pamphlets, tracts and pictures.""

News,2018-01-08,"Iholt Francis had been planning a trip from Jamaica to New York to visit his twin brother to celebrate their 28th birthday. Instead, he arrived last week to take his brother off life support.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/nyregion/funerals-begin-for-victims-of-bronx-fire-that-killed-13.html,711," Iholt Francis had been planning a trip from Jamaica to New York to visit his twin brother to celebrate their 28th birthday. Instead, he arrived last week to take his brother off life support. Mr. Francis's twin, Holt Francis, died a week after a fire on Dec. 28 ripped through his apartment building in the Bronx, killing four members of his family and eight other people. The fire was the deadliest in New York City in 27 years. It was started by a 3-year-old boy who was playing with a stove and was fueled by gusty winds. Funeral services will be held Monday, at the R.G. Ortiz Funeral Home in Manhattan, for Holt Francis; his wife, Karen Stewart-Francis, 37; their daughters, Kylie, 2, and Kelesha, 7; and their cousin, Shawntay Young, 19. Their bodies will be sent to Saint Catherine Parish in Jamaica for burial on Jan. 21. Several other funerals will be held over the next few weeks. Services were held on Sunday for the youngest victim, 7-month-old Amora Batiz, and her grandmother, Maria Batiz, 65. Ms. Stewart-Francis, a hotel housekeeper, belonged to a close-knit family from southeast Jamaica. Some relatives had lived in the building, on Prospect Avenue in the Belmont neighborhood, for nearly a decade. Her family occupied five apartments there, and relatives doubled as babysitters, cooks and hairdressers. Her sister Andrene Paul said the family was still raising money to cover the cost of transporting their bodies to Jamaica for burial. Ms. Paul said it had always been her sister's wish to be buried there alongside their father. Ms. Stewart-Francis was the youngest of their parents' 13 children, and ""she and our father were joined at the hip,"" Ms. Paul said. Mr. Francis joined her in the United States in 2016, and the two married that May. They had lived in the apartment building for about a year, Ms. Paul said. ""We always try to stick together because kids are involved,"" said Ms. Paul, whose pregnant daughter lived on the third floor with her husband and 10-year-old son. ""It works that way, like a community for each other."" Many of the fire's victims were working-class immigrants, and relatives have been frustrated in their efforts to plan funerals because they are unfamiliar with the process and have little money to cover expenses. Six victims of the fire were from the Ashanti region in Ghana. They included a soldier and two children. Samuel Amaoko, the consulate general of Ghana in New York City, said relatives expressed confusion about what to do at a meeting last week. They expected the consulate to provide financial assistance, but he could not offer them money. Instead, Mr. Amaoko said, he provided information and sanctioned a GoFundMe page hosted by the National Ghana Parade Council, a business and community alliance that organizes an annual parade. A vigil is planned for Saturday at the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, the council president, Catherine Cudjoe, said. Funeral services for Justice Opodu, 54, and his brother Gabriel Sarkodie, 48, will be on Jan. 20, and then their bodies will be flown to Ghana. Funeral arrangements have not yet been made for three members of the Donkor family: Solomon Donkor, 49, and his children, Hannah, 17, and William, 12. Kwabena Mensah has been trying for more than a week to make arrangements for his son, Private Emmanuel Mensah, 28, a soldier with the New York Army National Guard who died pulling people from the fire. But his efforts have been stalled. Eric Durr, a spokesman for the New York National Guard, said federal regulations prevented the military from taking on Private Mensah's funeral and burial costs because he was on a reserve soldier and did not die in the line of duty. The military requires soldiers to complete 24 months of active duty to be eligible for burial benefits. Mr. Mensah's family can still choose to have military honors presented at his funeral, Mr. Durr said, and the military had assigned a casualty assistance officer to help the family navigate the process. ""I pleaded with them, but they said they cannot do it,"" Mr. Mensah said. ""This is all new to me. I'm naïve about all of this. I'm totally confused about all of this. It's heartbreaking."""
News,2018-01-08,"With its 520 miles of coastline and thousands of acres of waterfront development, New York has more residents living in high-risk flood zones than any other city in the country. Hurricane Sandy, the devastating October 2012 storm, did $19 billion in damage to the city, and the pace of development along the water has only increased.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/nyregion/new-york-city-flood-maps-fema.html,2375," With its 520 miles of coastline and thousands of acres of waterfront development, New York has more residents living in high-risk flood zones than any other city in the country. Hurricane Sandy, the devastating October 2012 storm, did $19 billion in damage to the city, and the pace of development along the water has only increased. Now, after a year in which hurricanes ravaged Houston and the Caribbean, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is substantially redrawing New York's flood maps for the first time in three decades. It is a painstaking process that will affect tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people, determining how and where buildings can be constructed and the cost of flood insurance on everything from modest bungalows to luxury skyscrapers. New York will be the first major metropolis to be remapped taking into account the realities of climate change, like rising sea levels and increasingly powerful storms. The new models, for coastal areas stretching from Cape May to the Hudson Valley, will be used to shape the city's future zoning, development and building standards to help it become more sustainable. As a result, FEMA and city officials say, New York could be an example for other places around the country. But the maps will also be shaped by the history of New York, where 80 percent of properties were built before the current flood maps and requirements were in place, as opposed to 20 percent nationally, noted J. Andrew Martin, acting chief of FEMA's risk analysis branch in New York. If those older buildings end up in high-risk zones, their owners could be required to buy flood insurance or make expensive modifications, adding costs that are beyond the reach of many working-class homeowners. The collision of science with political and economic realities means that the battle over how many more people will fall in the flood zones will be fought house by house, block by block, with millions of dollars at stake. ""It's a game of inches,"" said Elizabeth Malone, program manager of resiliency and insurance at Neighborhood Housing Services Brooklyn, a community group that counsels residents in flood-prone areas. In New York, where more than 50,000 people are homeless, and where the mayor has pledged to create or preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing by the end of 2022, the FEMA maps could add further financial strain. The city has already pushed back against FEMA. The agency proposed preliminary maps in 2013 — soon after Hurricane Sandy — that would have doubled both the area of flood zones and the number of people inside them. The city, in an unusual move, successfully challenged the scientific assumptions underlying the new maps. In the coming weeks, formal discussions on the maps between New York City and the agency will likely begin. There is no time to waste, said Mr. Martin, who has been on assignment in Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria. ""Sandy may not happen again like it did,"" he said, ""but there will be something very similar, and it's not that far off."" But the process will not be fast, and homeowners should be prepared to be in ""limbo"" for years, said Daniel A. Zarrilli, the city's chief resilience officer and senior director for climate policy and programs. That may not be ideal, he said, but it is ""better than it could have been had the city not worked to protect affordability and incorporate climate risks onto the maps. We don't want to jack up insurance rates and cause a foreclosure crisis, and we want a smoother glide path to a better flood insurance program, and more accurate maps."" The first time FEMA mapped the city was in 1983. Since then, only minor changes have been made. The agency was working on an update, as requested by the city, when Hurricane Sandy hit. A month later, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg underscored the urgency of that task in a speech at a downtown hotel by displaying a map with the current flood zone, followed by a second with the areas actually flooded by the hurricane. The audience gasped at how far the flooding had exceeded the mapped zone. In the highest-risk zones on a flood map, waves can go higher than three feet. In the next zone, an area has a 1 percent chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 100-year flood. In a moderate-risk zone, an area has a 0.2 percent chance of flooding in any year, in what is called a 500-year flood. Put another way, houses in a high-risk zone have a one-in-four chance of being flooded over the course of a 30-year mortgage, compared with a 10 percent risk of having a fire. Federal law requires anyone with a mortgage in the highest-risk areas to get flood insurance. But being on the map is not a particularly reliable predictor that a home might get flooded: About 80 percent of people who suffered flood damage from Hurricane Sandy did not have flood insurance. Indeed, the maps have been long been viewed as inexact. One recent federal report estimated there was a 40 percent ""uncertainty of flood predictions."" In 2015, in its highly technical 180-page challenge to FEMA's proposed new maps, the city argued that the federal agency had overstated the base flood elevation — the height of flooding that might be expected in a 100-year flood — by two feet in some areas. FEMA also inflated the flood zone area by a third, the city claimed, ""unnecessarily putting approximately 26,000 buildings and 170,000 residents"" in higher-risk locations and ""causing an affordability challenge."" In March, at the city's request, the RAND Corporation detailed the maps' potential impact in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. The report found that the proposed maps could ""reduce property values, increase loan defaults, lower tax revenue, and create hardships for current residents."" One area that would be most affected is the largely working-class neighborhood of Canarsie, in Brooklyn along the coast of Jamaica Bay. When the original maps are compared with FEMA's 2013 proposal, the difference for the area is stark: Just 26 buildings were in the 1983 FEMA flood zone; under the revised maps, that would have skyrocketed to 5,000 buildings. Canarsie, which is home to many Caribbean immigrants, has a higher percentage of owner-occupied homes with mortgages than the city as a whole. But in a neighborhood that weathered the city's highest foreclosure rate after the subprime mortgage crisis, homeowners, many of whom rent out their basements to help pay the bills, have ""little to put toward mitigating their flood risk,"" according to a city report released in May. Even though the final flood maps are years away, city officials and community groups are exhorting residents to take advantage of low-cost or even free programs funded by the state Governor's Office of Storm Recovery. By buying flood insurance now, officials say, policy holders would be grandfathered in and subject to only gradual increases once new maps are established. With such coverage, premiums would probably be around $500 a year; without it, the annual rates could be $3,000. But even $500 a year can be a hard sell in Canarsie, as made clear by a recent tour with Zachary Paganini, a doctoral student at the City University of New York, who has been researching what the looming changes to flood insurance might mean for the neighborhood. On Flatlands Eighth Street, adjacent to Fresh Creek, Nelson Lopez, who does not have flood insurance, noted that his entire block was decimated by Hurricane Sandy, even though the houses were outside FEMA's flood zones. If the revisions were made permanent, his house would go from a no-risk area to a high-risk zone. ""If you get flood insurance, you can't pay your other bills,"" he said. Theresa Fraser lives on Canarsie Road, a half mile from Jamaica Bay. About two feet of water rushed into her basement during Hurricane Sandy. After seeking advice from the Center for New York City Neighborhoods, a nonprofit group that created a flood mapping tool, she purchased flood insurance to qualify for FEMA disaster funds. But Ms. Fraser, a day-care teacher, dropped it after a year because she could not afford the $600 annual premium. ""I definitely don't want to be in a high-risk zone, but I don't want to move,"" said Ms. Fraser, a Guyanese immigrant who moved into her house 20 years ago. ""You can't always run from one place to the next because you're worried things will happen."" One clue to the possible contours of any future maps may be found in a single column buried in the city's 2015 appeal. The city estimated that if the scientific errors were removed from FEMA's revision, the number of people in the flood zone could increase by 6 percent to 230,000 over the 1983 maps, and the number of one- to four-family buildings could grow by 38 percent to 36,000. Both increases would be much smaller than the 100 percent jumps suggested by FEMA's initial maps. When homeowners suffer flood damage, they file claims. And of the 116 properties in New York City that have filed multiple FEMA claims in the last 20 years, more than a quarter have not been in the flood zone, according to an analysis prepared for The New York Times by the Natural Resources Defense Council. Two areas have had the most properties with repeat flood claims. One is Broad Channel, in Queens. The other is the 10465 ZIP code in the Bronx, in the shadow of the Throgs Neck Bridge, home to Edgewater Park. Edgewater Park is a tightknit and predominantly white community that feels more like a seaside village than a city neighborhood. But its beauty is also a burden, explained Deborah A. Roff, president of the Edgewater Park Owners Cooperative. In 1992, a nor'easter nearly drowned the neighborhood. Then there was the concussive trifecta of Hurricane Irene, Tropical Storm Lee and Hurricane Sandy from 2011 to 2012, strewing debris far inland and leaving gashes in houses that remain uninhabitable. But now, what really worries Ms. Roff and her neighbors is not the next storm, but the federal government. ""They're not even afraid of the storms, because with the flood, you can pray — 'Jesus, please don't let the flood come,'"" said Ms. Roff. ""They're more afraid of the regulations and the flood insurance because they're getting the bill, and they've got to pay that bill."" The various maps that the residents have used to determine the flood boundaries — whether from FEMA, the Department of City Planning or other sources — offer conflicting results about whether a house is in the flood plain, Ms. Roff said. On her own block of bungalows, she said, one homeowner pays $5,000 a year in premiums. A few doors down, another does not have insurance. Just beyond that, a new homeowner is spending $300,000 to raise a house 20 feet like ""a castle in the sky,"" she said, thereby avoiding paying any insurance. By working with the City Planning department to allow for more flood-resilient construction and investment, to be paid for, at least in part, by higher maintenance fees, Ms. Roff hopes to minimize the community's risks, even if it means that its residents have to pay more. ""Fair is fair — we don't want to hurt anyone else by fixing this issue,"" she said. While the maps are probably years away, the process has already influenced how the city builds, especially along a waterfront that has become more accessible yet more expensive. In 2010, the value of property within the 100-year floodplain was $58.7 billion, according to a report by Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller. By 2014, that value had climbed to $129.1 billion, making it more urgent to invest in resiliency projects, Mr. Stringer concluded. Moreover, FEMA's 2013 proposal to expand the flood maps applies to all new or substantially improved buildings. That means more buildings are now subject to tougher building codes enacted after Hurricane Sandy. Some residential and commercial developers are embracing the standards as a vital long-term investment. One such project is Greenpoint Landing in Brooklyn, an 11-building, 22-acre development that will add 5,500 apartments on a former industrial site. The project, now under construction, features a terraced esplanade park that rises like steps from the East River, which will be filled with absorbent material to protect against storm surges, high winds and more. Ultimately, the project will raise the waterfront by about three to five feet above the existing coastline, said Karen Tamir, principal with James Corner Field Operations, a landscape architecture and urban planning firm that is designing the project. In October, the Waterfront Alliance, a coalition that works to protect New York's waterways and shoreline, said that the project had satisfied the alliance's Waterfront Edge Design Guidelines, a new ratings system reminiscent of the LEED certification program for green buildings. ""If you bake the retrofit into your costs now, it's a marginal investment, and it protects your property and, more importantly, the people who will live there,"" said Roland Lewis, the alliance's president and chief executive. In some cases, however, the reaction has been to get out of the flood zone, in any possible way. Consider a project in TriBeCa to convert a 10-story office building at 11 Beach Street into luxury condominiums priced at up to $12 million apiece. Constructed in 1900, the building was outside the original FEMA flood zones. But the southeast corner of the building would fall inside the newer zones, ""thus subjecting the entire building to FEMA regulations,"" according to documents filed with the city's Department of Buildings in October 2013. At first, the project's developer, HFZ Capital Group, and its architects believed that they would be exempt, in part because the affected piece of the building, on the corner of Beach Street and St. Johns Lane, was so small. But city officials said that was not the case. So the architects proposed an ingenious solution: slice two feet off the bottom corner of the building. After consulting with FEMA, the city ultimately concluded that the proposal ""shall absolve the applicant from complying."""
Editorial,2018-01-08,Each new revelation about the degradation of New York’s subways seems more shocking than the last. But it all comes down to one thing: New York’s leaders have failed the millions of people who use the transit system every day.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/nyc-leaders-subway-mta.html,843," Each new revelation about the degradation of New York's subways seems more shocking than the last. But it all comes down to one thing: New York's leaders have failed the millions of people who use the transit system every day. The latest dismaying detail comes from a report by Brian Rosenthal in The Times, which concludes that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that runs the subway system, spends far more to build tunnels and extend train lines than agencies doing comparable projects elsewhere. Its construction projects have more workers than those in other cities, and workers are kept on hand even when there is no need for them. Contractors add a premium to their bids, claiming it compensates them for dealing with the M.T.A.'s bureaucracy. And some unions and contractors negotiate wages and work rules without any say from the authority. Billions of dollars that could have gone to maintaining and improving the subways, which use a signaling system that dates to the 1930s, have been wasted on exorbitant costs. Projects have also been delayed by mismanagement. Blame for these costs belongs to politically powerful construction companies and labor unions that drive up costs under the lax oversight of public officials who have no incentive to rouse sleeping legislative watchdogs. Consider the following: The first phase of the Second Avenue subway, completed at the end of 2016, cost $2.5 billion per mile; and the extension of the No. 7 line to Hudson Yards, finished the year before, cost $1.5 billion per mile. By contrast, Paris, a dense and historic city with strong labor unions, is building a line extension similar to the Second Avenue project for just $450 million a mile, which is roughly comparable to the average cost for subway projects around the world. Several transit experts have pointed out these cost discrepancies in recent years. The M.T.A. chairman, Joe Lhota, acknowledged to The Times that excessive costs have ""been a problem,"" but he says New York has unique challenges, like aging utilities and high density, that contribute to high costs. That is not credible, since Paris and London are older than New York and have done a much better job improving and expanding their transit systems in recent years. Still, Mr. Lhota, whom Gov. Andrew Cuomo appointed last year, says the M.T.A. is working to bring down costs. To be successful, he will need help from Mr. Cuomo, who has been friendly with the labor unions whose members operate cranes and dig tunnels, and with the contractors doing the work. The unions and the construction companies are big campaign contributors and have a strong financial incentive to preserve the status quo. Mr. Cuomo, in turn, will have to stir the Legislature, which has, regrettably, taken little interest in overseeing and improving the M.T.A. Besides annual hearings about the M.T.A.'s budget, the State Assembly and the Senate conducted just two oversight hearings on the M.T.A. between 2015 and last year, according to Reinvent Albany, a public interest group. Last year, as the subways were plagued by delays and derailments, the Assembly held just one oversight hearing, about the impact of the track work Amtrak was doing at Penn Station. The Senate did not bother with even that. By contrast, the New York City Council, which has little sway over the M.T.A., has held nine oversight hearings in the past three years. It's not as if the Legislature has no power. It held important hearings in 2016 about water contamination in Hoosick Falls and elsewhere. Those hearings helped shine a light on how a toxic chemical got into groundwater, and state officials were pressed to explain why they did not respond more quickly. The state comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, audits the M.T.A. and other state agencies. His office has examined construction costs for projects like East Side Access, which will bring the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal, but it has not compared M.T.A. spending with the spending of agencies in other big cities. The comptroller could do more to expose waste. Ultimately, Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature need to reform the M.T.A. Lawmakers could require that the authority use the ""design-build"" process, which puts design and construction teams together early and usually reduces the need for big changes later. The state should also make sure the M.T.A. has a voice in negotiations between contractors and labor unions, to reduce the potential for featherbedding that exists when both sides can pass on costs to the government. If that doesn't happen, no amount of revenue, whether it comes from higher fares, from a tax on millionaires as Mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed, or from congestion pricing as Mr. Cuomo has suggested, will be enough to fix the subways. Too many of those added dollars would be frittered away. New Yorkers like to think their city is the best. But there is one superlative — most expensive subway line on Earth — no taxpayer or commuter would care to be associated with. The state's leaders ought to feel the same way."
Op-Ed,2018-01-08,"I resist applying clinical diagnoses to people, and that includes Donald Trump. I’m not a doctor, and a proper diagnosis would require a personal evaluation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/trump-stable-genius-smart.html,862," I resist applying clinical diagnoses to people, and that includes Donald Trump. I'm not a doctor, and a proper diagnosis would require a personal evaluation. But I would be basking in false virtue if I simply pretended that I'm not aware that some of the behaviors displayed by this man line up with the symptoms of certain personality disorders. So I must couch my concerns this way: There is no way for me to know for sure, but all indications lead me to believe that Donald Trump struggles to fit into the frame of what we call normal behavior, and he often fails at it in spectacular ways. And it is not only you and I worried about the president's mental stability. According to Michael Wolff's ""Fire and Fury,"" the book that has so gotten under the president's skin and into his mind, those closest to him also worry about his mental health. Trump was so bothered by the book that he took to Twitter over the weekend to defend himself against the damaging portrait it contains: that of a mentally unstable simpleton. Trump wrote that ""throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart"" and then upped the self-accolades by writing that being elected would ""qualify as not smart, but genius … and a very stable genius at that!"" Whatever you say, Wile E. Coyote. The truth is that it appears that most of the conservative architecture in this country — members of the administration, members of Congress, Fox News, the Republican National Committee, and Trump's die-hard base — are all engaged in an exercise to defend, excuse, protect and absolve a man and his behaviors, which may well do irreparable damage to the country. They have learned to praise him in order to steady him. His weakness is an unending need for affirmation. Anyone who provides it, he abides. It's simple. Also sad. Actually, pathetic. Trump's defenders have bolstered his insistence that all questioning of his competence is purely political. I will be the first to admit that everything in politics has a political component. Would liberals relish more discord in the conservative caucus? Yes. Would Democrats like to see Republicans dispirited going into the midterm elections? Yes. Would many people like to see Trump's political wounds worsen and possibly see him impeached? Yes. Personally, am I opposed to his policies? Yes. Do I find his obsessive Obama-erasure quest both pathological and a poor policy mission? Yes. Am I offended to the highest order by his coddling of white supremacists, his clear hostility to minorities, his anti-Muslim and anti-Mexican rhetoric and his misogyny? You bet! But can I also have legitimate, nonpartisan, nonpolitical concern about Trump's stability, fitness and basic intellectual capacity? Of course I can, and so should everyone else. Let's start here: From everything I have ever read about the man, he is not particularly smart. This is sometimes hard for people to understand. They equate financial gain with intellectual gifts, but the two are hardly synonymous. Being gifted at exploitation is not the same as intellectualism. It is a skill, but one separate from scholarship. Being able to see and exploit a need, void or insecurity in people can be an interesting, and even lucrative, endowment, but it is not enlightenment. He is also not a reader. That is not to say that he can't read, but rather that, given his druthers, he won't. But mental instability — whether a diagnosable disorder or just a combination of crippling character traits — is a problem of another magnitude. That goes to basic competence and substantially raises the stakes. This is the problem we face: We have a person occupying the presidency who is impetuous, fragile, hostile, irrational, intentionally uninformed, information-averse and semiliterate. The question we have to put to the elected officials protecting this president, and indeed to all those being paid a taxpayer-funded salary and then concealing, distorting or denying the truth to make this man look competent, is: Don't you have an obligation, either moral, ethical, patriotic or otherwise, to level with America that you, too, are concerned by Trump's erratic behavior? At the very least, don't the members of the House and Senate, who swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution, have an obligation to rebuke this president for his attacks on the press and free speech, both protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution? These elected officials in particular are not only obsequiously placating a man nursing a god complex, they are displaying a staggering lack of national fealty. You can't say that you love America and not take a stand to defend it from harm. These politicians are taking the politically expedient track for political gain or political survival. They would rather defend a compromised Republican president than have to live in the wake of a deposed one. They would like to try to manage the damage Trump may do, rather than prevent that damage from occurring. And in so doing, they are moving dangerously close to the day when being a loyal Trump Republican could be seen as being an unpatriotic American."

Here's the sign-up.) Good morning. Here's what you need to know: • President Trump's supporters aggressively countered revelations in a new book that some of his closest aides believe he is unstable. The president described himself as a ""very stable genius."" Stephen Bannon, Mr. Trump's former chief strategist, issued a striking mea culpa. Two things stand out, our chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe writes: how far Mr. Trump's tweets deviate from the way past presidents expressed themselves and how rarely he has followed through on his words. Two Republican senators urged the Justice Department to investigate the former British spy behind the explosive dossier about Mr. Trump's ties to Russia that became public nearly a year ago. _____ • In Germany, coalition talks have resumed in earnest more than three months after elections that left Chancellor Angela Merkel weakened. Our correspondent in Berlin looks at the sticking points, including immigration, health care and plans to overhaul the eurozone. Meanwhile in France, our correspondent looks at President Emmanuel Macron's ambitions for the year ahead. His absolute self-confidence — critics say, arrogance — appears to have been undaunted by roller-coaster ratings. Negotiations on changes to the French unemployment compensation system are scheduled to begin this week. Mr. Macron is in China today. _____ • In the Middle East, a de facto alliance against common foes is drawing Arab leaders into a collaboration with their onetime nemesis, Israel. One indication: We obtained audio recordings of an Egyptian intelligence officer coaxing talk show hosts to persuade their audiences to accept President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. On Sunday, Israel published a blacklist of 20 organizations, including 11 groups in Europe, whose leaders it has barred from entering the country for supporting a boycott of it. Separately, the financial ties to Israel of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, have deepened, fueling a perception of conflicts of interest. _____ • At the Golden Globe Awards, the host Seth Meyers turned directly to what he called ""the elephant not in the room,"" when he opened the broadcast by saying, ""Good evening, ladies and remaining gentlemen."" Oprah Winfrey, who received a lifetime achievement award, jolted the audience with her speech focused on the #MeToo movement. Actresses and some actors wore black to make a statement about sexual harassment in Hollywood. In a series of essays, our reporters debate how recent revelations have changed the entertainment industry. Here's the full list of winners, including ""In the Fade,"" a tale of grief in modern Germany. • We followed a team on a quest to bring the internet to Tusheti, a region in the Caucasus that is perhaps one of the world's most remote places, making it more accessible to tourists. • Facebook, Google, Netflix and other large tech companies are putting their reputations and financial clout behind efforts to stop a repeal of net neutrality rules in the U.S. • The U.S. Justice Department tried, and failed, to hold a Swiss banker personally accountable for creating bank accounts for Americans trying to evade U.S. taxes. Dozens more cases are pending. • Intel's chief executive, Brian Krzanich, is in the hot seat over Meltdown and Spectre, two chip security issues that were disclosed last week. • Here's a snapshot of global markets and a look at what could move them this week. • Theresa May, the British prime minister, is expected to reshuffle her cabinet starting today. [The Guardian] • While Spain's politicians bicker over Catalonia's future, the country's judges are showing no sign of softening their stance toward the Catalan separatists. [The New York Times] • In the U.S., the White House asked Congress for $18 billion to build a wall on the Mexican border in exchange for protecting young undocumented immigrants from deportation. [The New York Times] • Ahmed Shafik, the strongest challenger to Egypt's military-backed leader, withdrew from the country's presidential race. [The New York Times] • Protests over rising bread prices broke out across Sudan. At least one person was killed. [Reuters] • In Stockholm, a man was killed by an explosive device he found outside a subway station. [Associated Press] • A senior BBC News editor accused the network of operating a ""secretive and illegal"" salary system that pays men more than women in similar positions. [The New York Times] • The legal troubles of Mikheil Saakashvili, the former president of Georgia who has cast himself as an antigraft leader in Ukraine, mounted with an in absentia prison sentence in Georgia. [The New York Times] Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • Improve your relationship this year. (For starters, consider putting away your phone, after reading this briefing.) • Here are some tips for working better this year. • Recipe of the day: Keep dinner meatless with a chickpea and fennel ratatouille. • Christians around the world held celebrations to mark the Epiphany, the official end to the Christmas holiday. Here are photos from Bulgaria, Greece, Mexico and elsewhere. Above, a procession in Pamplona, Spain. • In memoriam: France Gall, the French pop singer hailed as a ""timeless icon of the French chanson,"" died at 70; John Young, who commanded the first space shuttle mission, died at 87. • The hit musical ""Hamilton"" has grown in stature on the London stage, our critic writes. It ""can make a traitor of any English citizen for a night."" • A new study on coral bleaching shows the phenomenon has become so frequent that reefs can no longer recover between severe cases. • A vodka bottle, said to be the world's most expensive at $1.3 million, was stolen last week from a pub in Copenhagen. It has since been found, dented and empty. When unrest erupted in Iran this month, President Trump used Twitter to reach out directly to antigovernment protesters in dozens of towns. Such public outreach is a lot easier than it used to be. A hundred years ago today, President Woodrow Wilson, above, outlined his terms for an end to World War I in a speech meant to appeal to the war-weary people of America's European foes. American newspapers such as The New York Times printed the 14-point speech in full, but that did not mean the average German would get the message. A few days later, a report in The Times documented efforts to spread the speech behind enemy lines, after Berlin threatened to execute pilots of planes distributing copies. ""What is now wanted is some kind of flying craft which will travel fifty to a hundred miles or more, dropping propaganda on the way,"" The Daily Chronicle, a British paper, reported.

Good morning. Here's what you need to know: • Days after Stephen Bannon was quoted in a new book accusing Donald Trump Jr. of treason, the former chief strategist backed away from the comment on Sunday, saying President Trump's eldest son was ""a patriot and a good man."" (Read Mr. Bannon's statement here.) Over the weekend, the president and his supporters harshly criticized the book, ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,"" which raises questions about the president's mental fitness. In a tweet, Mr. Trump called himself a ""very stable genius."" • Genius or not, the president has left many countries unsure whether his messages on Twitter reflect U.S. foreign policy or can be safely ignored. If his threats are hollow, what does that do to American credibility? Our chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe explored that question. • A previously undisclosed $30 million deal last spring illustrates the growing financial ties between the family business of Jared Kushner, who has a prominent diplomatic role in the Middle East, and Israeli partners. The business dealings don't appear to violate ethics laws, and there is no evidence that Mr. Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, was involved in reaching the deal. • But the arrangement could undermine the perception of the U.S. as an independent broker in the region. ""I think it's reasonable for people to ask whether his business interests are somehow affecting his judgment,"" a lawyer who specializes in government ethics said of Mr. Kushner. • It is a quiet but telling trend across the country: Towns and cities are policing and governing themselves, hoping to increase protection against drug cartels — and against the Mexican state. We visited three enclaves that have created havens of relative safety. But their gains are fragile and have come at significant cost. • The areas ""are exceptions that prove the rule,"" our columnists write. ""Mexico's crisis manifests as violence, but it is rooted in the corruption and weakness of the state."" • The Golden Globes on Sunday were the first major awards show since allegations of sexual misconduct swept Hollywood, but it was a rousing speech by Ms. Winfrey that defined the night and captured the #MeToo mood. ""What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have,"" Ms. Winfrey said, accepting a lifetime achievement award. ""I'm especially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories."" (Read the full speech here.) • Our journalists discussed the show as it happened. We also have a full list of the winners, and pictures from the red carpet. • Nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador who have been allowed to live in the U.S. legally for more than a decade will have to leave, officials in Washington said today. Homeland Security is ending a humanitarian program that gave temporary protected status to Salvadorans after a pair of devastating earthquakes struck their country in 2001, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. • It is the Trump administration's latest reversal of immigration policies, and one of the most consequential to date. • President Trump heads to Tennessee today, where he is to give a speech intended to cast him as a friend of farmers. But his positions on trade and some parts of the new tax law threaten to undercut farmers' interests. • India's government and global technology companies are trying to coax people to give up their rupee notes, but some say they feel safer with cash. • The start of the International Consumer Electronics Show is one of the headlines to watch this week. • U.S. stocks were up on Friday. Here's a snapshot of global markets today. Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • Nine tips for navigating the workplace. • And eight ways to improve a relationship. • Recipe of the day: A meatless dinner of chickpea and fennel ratatouille. • At Kennedy International Airport in New York, a broken water main complicated operations that were already in disarray after last week's snowstorm. • Australia experienced a short-lived but blistering heat wave, including a high of just over 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47.3 degrees Celsius) in a Sydney suburb. • Carrie Gracie, a senior editor for BBC News, accused the network of operating a ""secretive and illegal"" salary system that pays men more than women in similar positions. • Christmas is officially over. Look at Epiphany celebrations around the world. • The quarterback for the Tennessee Titans caught his own pass for a touchdown, one of the highlights of the first round of the N.F.L. playoffs. • ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" was No. 1 at the North American box office. But the weekend's big movie news was in China, where ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" earned only $28.7 million. • In memoriam John Young walked on the moon, commanded the first space shuttle mission and became the first person to fly in space six times. He was 87. • Southern pride, Northern tune The Georgia Bulldogs' unofficial fight song has roots in a Civil War rallying cry for the North. We retraced the song's history ahead of Georgia's game tonight against Alabama. College football's national championship game begins at 8 p.m. Eastern. • Quiz time! Did you keep up with last week's news? Test yourself. • Quotation of the day ""You would think with water mains breaking all over town they would have a contingency plan. A couple of guys with squeegees doesn't seem to do the job."" — Michael Rossiter, of Jersey City, whose plans were disrupted by a water main break at Kennedy Airport.

Op-Ed,2018-01-08,"Last week, we learned that researchers had discovered two major flaws in microprocessors of nearly all the world’s computers. The revelation came on the heels of a distressing series of major hacks: In 2017, Yahoo revealed that all of its three billion accounts were compromised, WannaCry ransomware shut down hospitals across the globe, and an Equifax breach affected approximately 145.5 million consumers in the United States. The latest news about the computer security problems — whose names, “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” appropriately convey their seriousness — is just the latest evidence that true digital security remains out of our reach.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/opinion/cybersecurity-breach-spectre-meltdown.html,905," Last week, we learned that researchers had discovered two major flaws in microprocessors of nearly all the world's computers. The revelation came on the heels of a distressing series of major hacks: In 2017, Yahoo revealed that all of its three billion accounts were compromised, WannaCry ransomware shut down hospitals across the globe, and an Equifax breach affected approximately 145.5 million consumers in the United States. The latest news about the computer security problems — whose names, ""Spectre"" and ""Meltdown,"" appropriately convey their seriousness — is just the latest evidence that true digital security remains out of our reach. But when these vulnerabilities are exposed and damaging attacks occur, there are few lasting repercussions. Almost without fail, stock prices bounce back, customers return, executives keep their jobs or exit with golden parachutes, and government mostly looks the other way. After the news of Equifax's massive breach, for example, the company's stock dropped roughly 35 percent. But it's already recovered nearly half of its lost market value, and Fortune reported that the former chief executive officer Richard Smith retired with as much as $90 million in compensation. Resilience is one of the hallmarks of stable, mature markets, but something isn't right here. The tepid consequences are part of a growing problem. From a corporate governance and accountability perspective, cybersecurity today is being treated like accounting was before the fallout from the Enron scandal inspired the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's increased standards for corporate disclosures. With the privacy and personal data of hundreds of millions of people at risk, and especially now with the increasing ubiquity of connected devices in our lives, the security of digital assets is too important for that kind of treatment. We need to bolster a culture of responsibility around cybersecurity, combining stronger and more uniform corporate governance with a clearer government commitment to enact better defensive policies. A complex hack may not be a C.E.O.'s fault, but it is absolutely his or her responsibility. Investors and consumers need to demand more from the executives to whom they entrust their digital lives. The same holds true for government. Protection of the welfare and livelihood of its citizens is a foundational principle of government, and yet for more than a decade there has been very little consequence for nation-states and state-affiliated groups who've pilfered the intellectual property, and violated the personal privacy, of citizens and companies around the world. Strengthening a culture of responsibility will require changes by both companies and the government. Last year, the New York State Department of Financial Services took a promising step by implementing new data-security regulations for certain financial companies operating within the state. It includes rules for reporting cybersecurity events within 72 hours, annual proof-of-penetration tests, and, by 2020, third-party assessments — all designed to increase accountability and remove the fog of uncertainty that often surrounds breaches. The federal government would be wise to follow New York's lead and implement similar laws on the federal level. Without federal action in this regard, increased regulation of cybersecurity practices will happen anyway, but in a fragmentary and disjointed way. More uniform regulations can help a more uniform standard to emerge, providing companies with the predictability and certainty they need in order to evaluate their risk management and security investments the right way. While more must be expected of companies, more should be expected of government as well. American businesses are under attack by our nation's geopolitical adversaries, and by nonstate groups affiliated with them. Just imagine if American shipping companies were battling foreign navies, or if domestic airlines were fighting an adversary's air force. This asymmetry locks the businesses into fights they cannot win. In its most dire scenario, the increasing velocity and severity of cyberattacks on American companies may encourage more firms to take matters into their own hands by ""hacking back"" against their attackers. This would open a Pandora's box of ugly consequences. Even large Wall Street banks, spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year on security, cannot win against the Chinese or Russian militaries, so they escalate at their peril. But if private companies and individuals are not to fight back in self-defense, then their government must do a better job on their behalf. In short, the federal government must ensure that deterrence works in the digital domain. Cyberconflicts often pit the vast resources of nation-states against those of private companies. Businesses can only be reasonably expected to agree to increased cybersecurity regulation if they have confidence in the government to perform its basic function of protecting its citizens. Just as policy frameworks exist to respond to, and dissuade, physical attacks on Americans and their interests, foreign and domestic, so the government must deter adventurism in cyberspace. Notably, this doesn't merely mean that one hack justifies another — rather, the full range of diplomatic, informational, economic and military options should be on the table. Failure to make such consequences clear and credible contributes to a fundamental failure of deterrence in cyberspace and exposes the United States government, American businesses, and individual citizens to many more such attacks in the future. Every business is now a digital business, and nearly every citizen is increasingly reliant on the connected world. We live in an era of mass targeted attacks where nation state-level resources are being directed against companies and private citizens, and until our security culture changes, we can expect to see more massive breaches throughout 2018 and beyond."
briefing,2018-01-08,Good morning on this thawing Monday.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/nyregion/new-york-today-teaching-teens-the-financial-ropes.html,1173," Good morning on this thawing Monday. Alexa du Pont Bell arrived in New York City in 2000 in a seemingly financially secure position for a 22-year-old: She had a degree from Harvard and a position as an investment banker. But while she spent her days thinking about complex issues like fund-raising and equity, her personal finances began to fray. She missed payments on her credit card, was threatened with collections, and was spending a lot on rent, college loans and eating out. ""Where would I have learned personal finance?"" she said. ""Unless you get it from your family, there's no time where a teacher sits down and explains very basic financial principles,"" she said. After Ms. Bell got her own finances sorted out, she helped found Cents Ability, a nonprofit that teaches financial literacy to thousands of high school students across New York City. We recently sat down with Ms. Bell as part of our series about the people and inspirations behind local philanthropies. As a recent college graduate in New York City, Ms. Bell learned that she wasn't the only one among her peers who struggled to manage her finances. She often spoke with a college friend, John Moore, whose investment banking roommates also had trouble sticking to a budget or paying off debt on time. They figured that if bankers were having problems with home finances, regular New Yorkers might be as well. In 2002, the two hashed out a basic curriculum and started teaching it to teenagers at community centers and workshops. Friends and acquaintances, many of them from the financial services sector, volunteered to help. ""We connected Wall Street with Main Street,"" said Mr. Moore. Cents Ability was officially formed in 2004, and the organization began sending volunteers into the city's public schools with the help of New York Cares. In the classroom, Ms. Bell wasn't shocked that most students didn't know anything about personal finance — ""they were still using piggy banks,"" she said — but she was surprised by the enthusiasm of the students, many of whom were just starting their first jobs. ""Once you start earning money, it's one of the most exciting things that kids want to talk about,"" she said. Today, Cents Ability's weeklong course offers the basics on budgeting, credit scores, saving and investing, among other topics. Last year, around 300 volunteers offered classes to nearly 3,000 students across New York. In 2018, as outstanding credit card debt soars above a record high of $1 trillion in the U.S. and cashless businesses become even more normal, their mission feels more relevant than ever, Ms. Bell said. ""It's like feeding or clothing people,"" she said. ""It's a necessity. If you can mange your money, then you can feed and clothe and shelter yourself for another day."" Here's what else is happening: The Ice Age of 2018 is over. The cold spell that settled over North America, delivering record-breaking temperatures and a ""bomb cyclone,"" has retreated from New York.

News,2018-01-08,"It’s that time of year again when safety-conscious organizations issue cautionary tales about preventing falls and, failing that, protecting against serious injury when suddenly descending unintentionally from the vertical.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/well/how-to-prevent-falls.html,1109," It's that time of year again when safety-conscious organizations issue cautionary tales about preventing falls and, failing that, protecting against serious injury when suddenly descending unintentionally from the vertical. Even if you think you already know everything you need to know about falling, you'd be wise to read on. Many of us can use a periodic kick in the pants to help keep us safe. I know, because I'm one of those prone to doing something foolhardy even while thinking how dumb it is. Case in point: Having just read a ream of background information about the risks of falling and its exorbitant costs, both personal and financial, I did something utterly stupid. I stood on the edge of the bathtub in my slippers to clean the top of the surrounding tiles. I got away unscathed this time, but I've promised myself never to try that again. As a much younger friend reminded me, a little household dirt never killed anyone, but landing hard on bathroom fixtures is a common cause of fall-related injuries and even deaths among people of all ages, and especially those in and beyond their seventh decade. In much of the country, fall injuries rise during the winter months when walkways become slippery and trip hazards are obscured by snow, ice or, in some areas, by leaves. Senior citizens, being less agile and more fragile, are especially at risk. A map of fatal falls in the United States, published last April in the AARP Bulletin, provides graphic testimony: Wisconsin and Minnesota, two of our coldest states, led the nation in deaths from falls among residents 65 and older. Given the season, let's start with how to avoid slips, trips and falls outdoors when sidewalks can sometimes resemble hockey rinks. Step one: Check your footwear. Shoes and boots should have slip-resistant soles (rubber or neoprene, not plastic or leather). Or equip them with external traction cleats, sold under brand names like Yaktrax. Step two: Take smaller steps, bend forward slightly, go slow and walk as flat-footed as possible when it's icy or snowy. Check the steps and sidewalk for black ice before going out in the morning, even if only to pick up the paper or mail. Do likewise when stepping out of a vehicle. Although the air temperature may be above freezing, dew or fog can freeze on a colder surface. Regardless of the season, scan the path six or more feet ahead of you for trip hazards. Avoid carrying items that block your ability to see the ground in front of you. I once tripped and landed hard on an irregular sidewalk while carrying two shoeboxes in my arms. Even when empty-handed, be sure to pick your feet up to avoid catching a shoe. Now for the most common place for falls: Your home. Most dwellings contain a catalog of trip hazards, including piles of papers, loose carpets or floorboards, extension cords and clothing carelessly dropped on the floor, not to mention water or grease on the kitchen or bathroom floor. Remove as many of these as possible and wipe up all spills as soon as they happen. While important at any age, these precautions are critical for the elderly. Falls are the No. 1 cause of injury to seniors, one in three of whom can expect to fall each year. Too often the result is a debilitating fracture, loss of independence or death. Nearly three times as many people die after falling (some 32,000 a year) than are killed by guns in the United States. Even when the injury from a fall is minor, it can create fear that prompts people to avoid certain activities lest they fall again. When walking indoors, always wear shoes or slippers with nonskid soles — not barefoot (unless you want a broken toe), and never just socks unless they have nonslip grips on the soles. My slippers, which are really shoes with rubber soles, reside next to my bed so I can slip directly into them when I get up. Always use a handrail when going up and down stairs. Consider installing a railing on stoops that lack them. If the item you want to carry is too big to hold in one hand or arm, ask someone to help. Bathrooms are particularly dangerous, especially for the elderly, who can benefit greatly from safety bars in the tub or shower and next to the toilet. Nonskid mats in the shower and tub and on tile floors are a must for all ages. Among other steps to take that can reduce the risk of falling is to maintain physical strength and balance as you age. If you're uncertain of your stability or agility, consider some sessions with a physical therapist and practice the recommended exercises regularly. Higher levels of physical activity have been shown to protect against falls in a study of Canadian men and women 65 and older. Think before you climb. Always use a safety stool — not a chair or ledge — when trying to reach a high-up item. I now ask a tall customer or store clerk to help retrieve a grocery item on the top shelf, instead of standing on the edge of a lower shelf to reach or knock it down. At home, move all frequently used items to lower shelves, or purchase a cabinet that sits on the floor to store them in. Some experts recommend learning ""the right way to fall."" In the Netherlands, physical and occupational therapists even teach classes on the art of falling. The advice tends to focus on minimizing the risk and extent of injury by landing on soft tissue as gently as possible. It includes trying to stay relaxed as you fall; the stiffer you are, the more likely an injury. As you land, try to roll like a football player. When falling forward, the instinct is to stick out one's hands to break the impact, which often results in broken wrists instead. If possible, try to twist as you go down to land on a side and then roll over to your back. When falling backward, tuck your chin to your chest to avoid hitting your head, which can result in a concussion, and keep your arms in front of you. In all honesty, these measures are more easily described than executed. Several friends of a certain age who have fallen maintain that there was nothing they could do to mitigate an injury in the split second between being upright and lying flat on the ground. But consider mentally reviewing scenarios in which you ""practice"" falling more safely by visualizing the measures described above."
News,2018-01-08,Before reading the article: ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/learning/teaching-activities-for-the-golden-globes-get-halfway-woke.html,431," Before reading the article: What had you heard about the Golden Globe Awards before the ceremony on Sunday night? Many women, and men as well, who attended the ceremony wore only black. Do you know what this action protested? If you are not aware of the situation, read about what precipitated not just the wearing of black at the ceremony, but the movement to fight sexual harassment and gender inequality in the entertainment industry as well as other industries. Now, read the article, ""The Golden Globes Get (Halfway) Woke,"" and answer the following questions: 1. At the Golden Globes, who was presented with the Cecil B. DeMille Award? 2. To whom did she dedicate the award? 3. Who, during a red carpet special, called out the E! network for having a gender pay gap? 4. The article suggests there is an ""unsteady balance"" between the ""usually frothy Globes"" and the dissent that has been happening in recent months in the entertainment industry. How does the article characterize this imbalance? 5. How does the writer of the article explain why it was a ""surprisingly ordinary Golden Globes""? 6. Who won Golden Globe Awards on Sunday? Finally, tell us more about what you think: In the related Style article ""The Empty Gesture of Red Carpet Protest,"" Jenna Wortham expresses a negative view of the call to wear only black, which reminded her of the ""passive attempt at protest"" that some celebrities did at red carpet events shortly after the 2016 presidential election. She gives the example of the actress Lizzy Caplan posing at a movie premiere with ""Love Trumps Hate"" written in marker on her palm. Ms. Wortham writes: A few days ago, when I heard that several male actors were joining some actresses in their plans to wear all-black to the Golden Globes in solidarity with those who have experienced sexual misconduct, I felt the old flames of anger reignite. There is something unsettling about how little these celebrities have to lose by taking these stances. They aren't risking financial ruin, nor are they vulnerable to violence, as is the norm for most who take a bold position. It feels completely privileged, and a little complicit, to still participate in the larger system that has condoned sexual violence in their industry. Besides, don't they already wear lots of black on the red carpet anyway?! What are your thoughts on these observations? Do you think that celebrities aren't risking anything with such acts of protest? Must protest involve risk to be effective?

News,2018-01-09,A former Hong Kong government official pleaded not guilty in New York on Monday to federal charges that he tried to bribe Chad’s president and Uganda’s foreign minister in exchange for oil rights for a Chinese energy company.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/world/asia/hong-kong-patrick-ho-bribery-chad-senegal.html,678," A former Hong Kong government official pleaded not guilty in New York on Monday to federal charges that he tried to bribe Chad's president and Uganda's foreign minister in exchange for oil rights for a Chinese energy company. The former official, Chi Ping Patrick Ho, and a former foreign minister of Senegal, Cheikh Gadio, were arrested in November and charged with money laundering and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Trained as an eye surgeon in the United States, Mr. Ho, 68, served as Hong Kong's home affairs secretary from 2002 to 2007. After leaving office, he became the secretary general of the China Energy Fund Committee, a Hong Kong research organization that gets financing from CEFC China Energy Company, a major energy conglomerate that is based in Shanghai and has ties to the Chinese Communist Party. According to United States prosecutors, Mr. Ho took part in two bribery schemes. One involved a $2 million bribe offered to President Idriss Déby of Chad ""in exchange for securing business advantages"" for the conglomerate in its effort to obtain oil rights in the country without facing international competition. Mr. Gadio was the conduit for the offer, and was compensated by Mr. Ho with $400,000 wired through New York, the prosecutors said. Prosecutors say the second scheme involved a $500,000 bribe, again wired through New York, to an account controlled by Uganda's foreign minister, Sam Kutesa, and gifts and promises that profits would be shared with businesses controlled by his family from a potential joint venture involving the conglomerate. The governments of Uganda and Chad have denied the allegations, as has Mr. Gadio. If convicted, Mr. Ho could face more than a decade in prison. At a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan before Judge Katherine B. Forrest, he pleaded not guilty to all eight charges. His lawyer, Edward Y. Kim, declined to comment for this article. Douglas S. Zolkind, a federal prosecutor, told Judge Forrest that ""voluminous"" evidence would have to be shared with Mr. Ho's lawyers, including ""several hundred thousand documents consisting of emails and attachments"" from more than 10 accounts that prosecutors received warrants to search. Many of the documents are in Chinese, and some are in French. He also estimated that ""multiple thousands of pages of bank and financial and wire records relating to multiple different entities"" would need to be shared, along with about seven boxes of paper documents and information from 11 phones, four computers, a camera and other equipment seized during a search of the energy organization's offices in Virginia; data from two cellphones, an iPad and multiple USB drives seized from Mr. Ho; records from three iPhones, a Samsung phone, and multiple USB drives and SIM cards seized from Mr. Gadio. The volume of information is so great, Judge Forrest said, that ""my guess is that it will be a year"" before the start of the trial. Then he said, ""We really can go to trial whenever the defense is prepared to go to trial."" At a hearing on Dec. 1, Mr. Ho was denied bail. A federal prosecutor, Daniel C. Richenthal, argued that ""if he were to make it back to China, or for that matter, Uganda or Chad, the countries in which he committed the bribery offenses, we can never get him back."" Mr. Ho's lawyer, Mr. Kim, argued that ""to flee would be a disgrace,"" and said, ""It would destroy everything he's worked for and it would destroy his international reputation."" Mr. Ho's lawyers on Friday asked Judge Forrest to allow Mr. Ho to live under house arrest, with electronic monitoring, on a $10 million bond, with an agreement that he waive extradition, to minimize the chance he might flee. The case has received coverage in China, where CEFC, a once-obscure company, has become a major energy player, with investments in Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. CEFC is one of a small number of Chinese companies to receive Beijing's approval to pursue high-profile deals at a time when the government has largely restricted overseas acquisitions."
News,2018-01-09,MEXICO CITY — A Mexican governor said Monday that the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto was denying his state vital resources in order to squash a corruption investigation that reaches the highest ranks of the nation’s governing party.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/world/americas/mexico-pena-nieto-corruption-chihuahua.html,945," MEXICO CITY — A Mexican governor said Monday that the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto was denying his state vital resources in order to squash a corruption investigation that reaches the highest ranks of the nation's governing party. The governor, Javier Corral, was promised millions of dollars last December by the federal government to help fill budget shortfalls in his state, Chihuahua, which is in the midst of a financial crisis. But the federal Ministry of Finance has refused to deposit some of the funds, Mr. Corral said at a news conference on Monday in Mexico City. The governor described a 20-minute meeting he attended with the minister of finance and other officials on Jan. 4 at which the minister himself said Chihuahua would not get the agreed-upon money unless state officials told the minister more about the investigation. ""We were taken by surprise,"" Mr. Corral told a crowd of reporters gathered at a hotel. ""They could have sugarcoated it, but they said it clearly and outright."" Another attendee at the meeting, Mr. Corral's state finance chief, backed up the governor's version of events in an interview with The New York Times. In a written statement the minister of finance claimed that nearly $4 million dollars was not paid to the state partly because of an incorrect bank account and partly because of a lack of available funds. The ministry declined to comment on the accounts of the meeting. President Peña Nieto told local reporters that the news conference held by Governor Corral, as well as the accusations he made, seemed like ""political act."" The case in question has the potential to be explosive: State prosecutors in Chihuahua are examining the alleged embezzlement of more than $10 million in public funds used to finance the campaigns of candidates from the president's political party, according to hundreds of documents and testimony by former state officials reviewed by The Times. The case has already ensnared more than two dozen people, including an ally of the president and a high-ranking member of his party, Alejandro Gutiérrez, who is accused of operating the embezzlement scheme nationwide. The arrest has rattled officials in Mexico City, where the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, presides over the federal government. Mr. Gutiérrez was a top financial aide to the former president of the party, Manlio Fabio Beltrones, a major power broker who has also been described as the mastermind of the embezzlement scheme, according to the documents reviewed by The Times. The investigation has the potential to derail the party's ambitions to maintain power in this year's presidential elections. Corruption and impunity have been stains on the legacy of Mr. Peña Nieto, who is suffering some of the worst approval ratings in a quarter century. As the nation hurtles toward elections this summer, analysts say the PRI is growing desperate to keep a lid on any potential corruption scandals. It is in this environment that Mr. Corral, a governor who hails from an opposition party, has set out on his crusade against corruption. Now, the governor appears to be gambling with his state's finances to preserve his investigation. ""There is a clear intention to financially strangle the state,"" Mr. Corral said. On Monday, the governor cried foul publicly, claiming that the federal government had reneged on its commitment to Chihuahua. According to documents reviewed by The Times, the federal Ministry of Finance signed four agreements in December with officials in Chihuahua promising to transfer roughly $5 million to the state by the end of the month. As the year's end drew near, Mr. Corral said, the money had not arrived. To date, only one of the agreed payments, for roughly $1 million, has been sent, state officials said. But when Mr. Corral called to inquire about the missing funds, he said, he was told a meeting in person was required to resolve the matter. Pressed for time, and with state salaries to pay, Mr. Corral said he had been forced to take a bank loan to cover the shortfall, a costly expenditure for a state with ailing finances. Several days passed before Mr. Corral said he was able to sit down with the minister of finance, José Antonio González Anaya. In the meeting, the governor said, Mr. Anaya at first told Mr. Corral that there was an issue with the funds because they appeared to be similar to those associated with the investigation underway in his state. Given the conflict, and Mr. Corral's position that previous transfers were used to embezzle funds, the minister was not sure how he could transfer the money, Mr. Corral recalled being told. The governor said he had stood firm, saying he believed they were two separate issues. One was the abuse of public funds for political purposes, which took place under the last governor, who was a star member of the president's party. The other involved the signed agreements from Dec. 14 promising nearly $5 million in federal funds to fill a state budget hole, according to the four agreements reviewed by The Times. Mr. Corral said that the finance minister then openly asked him about the investigation, and that he had told him the funds would not be transferred until there was more clarity about the case. Mr. Corral said he took the comment as direct pressure to halt the investigation in order to save his state. ""We are aware we struck at the modus operandi of political corruption in Mexico, but the difference is that we have accounted for it technically and legally,"" Mr. Corral said. ""We won't give up the fight to break the pact of impunity, regardless of the retaliation and punishment."""
News,2018-01-09,"WASHINGTON — With a booming speech at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday night, Oprah Winfrey, the billionaire media entrepreneur and former television talk-show host, launched a thousand fantasies for Democrats: Of a historic campaign to put a black woman in the White House. Of a celebrity candidate, known for her big-hearted optimism, taking on a reality-show president defined by his thirst for combat.

Of a celebrity candidate, known for her big-hearted optimism, taking on a reality-show president defined by his thirst for combat. Of a presidency, some joked, where everybody would get a car. Ms. Winfrey's longtime partner, Stedman Graham, stoked the mood in a newspaper interview, suggesting to The Los Angeles Times that she would ""absolutely do it"" — with the caveat that such matters are ""up to the people."" There was no more official signal on Monday from Ms. Winfrey, 63, as to her interest in the presidency. She has disavowed any ambition to be a candidate in the past, though she has told associates in recent months that she wants to play a part in bringing the country together, two people briefed on her thinking said. If Ms. Winfrey's ambitions are unclear, the sometimes giddy reaction to her speech at a Hollywood awards dinner underscored the unfulfilled hunger among Democrats for a larger-than-life leader to challenge President Trump. With no obvious front-runner for the 2020 campaign, Democrats appear likely to spend the next few years grinding through internal disagreements over policy and identity in a long contest for the nomination. There are thorny disagreements in the party about how bluntly liberal its agenda should be, how boldly to confront Mr. Trump and how to balance the task of turning out core Democratic voters with the desire to win over disaffected Republicans and independents. In the imagination of some Democrats, Ms. Winfrey might offer an easy way out of those problems. She inspires crucial groups for the party — women and African-Americans — and alienates few. She has cast herself in American culture as an avatar of optimism, not defined in ideological terms. Having made a career out of preaching the values of empowerment and inclusion, she represents in some ways a natural counterpoint to Mr. Trump's proud pugilism. Senior Democrats in Washington said on Monday they had received no signal from Ms. Winfrey that she hoped to seek the White House. David Axelrod, the former chief strategist for Barack Obama, said Ms. Winfrey was a figure of unique political potential, with ""a boundless capacity for empathy and a preternatural ability to communicate powerfully and authentically — as we saw at the Golden Globes."" Mr. Axelrod questioned, however, whether Ms. Winfrey would be the right fit for 2020: ""Would she want to submit herself to the unforgiving, relentless and sometimes absurd process of running for president?"" he wondered, adding: ""Will there be hunger in 2020 for someone with some experience in government, after Trump?"" Some Democrats expressed skepticism and even frustration about the swirl of fascination with Ms. Winfrey, arguing that the party was jumping the gun with fevered speculation about 2020. Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a young liberal in the chamber, wrote tersely on Twitter: ""Hey. Let's focus on winning in 2018. Thanks."" Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist from the party's progressive wing, said it would be a mistake for Democrats to rush toward a magnetic personality rather than hashing out a compelling agenda for the midterm elections and beyond. ""Beating Trump isn't just about finding the right candidate — we have to show what we stand for,"" Ms. Katz said. ""Other than 'we all get a car,' what will an Oprah presidency look like?"" she added, referring to when Ms. Winfrey famously gave a car to every audience member at her show. Ms. Winfrey's sudden prominence in the nation's political imagination speaks, in some respects, to the merging of politics and entertainment in the American mind. She has occupied a singular role in the television industry, parlaying roles as a local news anchor and a talk-show host in Chicago into a media empire that includes her own cable network and a fortune estimated at close to $3 billion. Gallup polling regularly finds Ms. Winfrey among the country's most admired women, alongside Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, suggested — with a dose of skepticism — that Ms. Winfrey was the kind of political outsider Democrats might embrace. Alluding to Mr. Trump's lack of experience, Ms. Pelosi tartly told a small group of reporters that Ms. Winfrey had other qualities going for her: ""Oprah has read books. She knows how to identify talent."" ""If we're going into a place where they are devaluing experience in terms of substance and legislative acumen and stuff like that,"" Ms. Pelosi said, ""you might as well have somebody who knows what they don't know and would get the best possible people there."" Ms. Winfrey's commercial reach transcends race and income level, analysts say, propelling so many books and products to overnight success that it has earned its own sobriquet: ""The Oprah Effect."" In 2015, Ms. Winfrey bought a 10 percent stake in Weight Watchers and assumed a position on the company's board, a move that instantly doubled the company's sluggish share price and added $400 million to its market value. Other investments have eluded that Midas touch. Ms. Winfrey's cable channel, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, a joint venture with Discovery Communications Inc., initially struggled to gain traction and last year earned an average of 462,000 prime time viewers daily. In December, Discovery said it would take majority control of OWN, purchasing 24.5 percent of the channel for $70 million from Ms. Winfrey's company, Harpo. Ms. Winfrey's most potent appeal, industry analysts say, is among somewhat older consumers — or perhaps, voters — with women over 55 as her strongest cohort. She is especially popular among African-American women and white suburban women, two groups Democrats will rely on in the 2018 and 2020 elections. By Monday afternoon, the White House had responded to the threat of Oprah in 2020. ""We welcome the challenge,"" said Hogan Gidley, a spokesman for the president, ""whether it be Oprah Winfrey or anybody else."" But Ms. Winfrey has approached politics cautiously over the years, engaging highly selectively. In 2007, she intervened for Mr. Obama, holding rallies for him and hailing him as ""the one."" And in 2013, she hosted a fund-raising event for Cory Booker, in his first bid for Senate in New Jersey. During the 2016 campaign, Ms. Winfrey endorsed Mrs. Clinton but never ventured onto the campaign trail. Though Ms. Winfrey and her staff discussed a possible appearance with the Clinton campaign, none was ever scheduled. Ms. Winfrey's aides cited her focus on righting her television network as the reason for her difficult schedule. Minyon Moore, a Clinton adviser who communicated with the Winfrey team, said the campaign had been ""delighted"" to have Ms. Winfrey's endorsement. Should Ms. Winfrey seek to assemble a campaign team for 2020, Ms. Moore said, ""I suspect she would have her pick."" Less certain is whether Ms. Winfrey could navigate the ideological pitfalls of a presidential campaign and give voice not just to broad themes, but actual policy prescriptions. While Ms. Winfrey has aligned herself generally with Democrats like Mr. Obama, her views on a range of issues from financial regulation to drone warfare are opaque. She drew criticism from the left last year after saying in an interview that she felt hopeful and believed Mr. Trump had been ""humbled"" after meeting with Mr. Obama during the presidential transition. Alixandria Lapp, a strategist helping lead Democrats' effort to retake the House, said the profile of a media mogul outsider would be an uncomfortable match for the party. ""I think it's highly unlikely that Democrats will ever nominate our own version of Donald Trump — a celebrity with no government experience — because our party tends to respect government and governing experience,"" Ms. Lapp said. Ms. Winfrey has recently taken on political topics as a special correspondent for CBS News's ""60 Minutes,"" including a segment on the country's political divisions and another on the use of solitary confinement in prisons. But even to close friends and admirers, the prospect of an Oprah 2020 race appeared far-fetched or impossible as recently as last year. After Mr. Trump's inauguration, when the traditional barriers to entry into presidential politics appeared to melt away, Ms. Winfrey's associates dismissed the idea. A reporter who last March contacted Ms. Winfrey's best friend, Gayle King of CBS News, got an emphatic reaction to the 2020 question. ""NOT A CHANCE!!!!!"" Ms. King replied at the time, adding: ""In caps for a reason."""
News,2018-01-09,"LONDON — Despite promises of reform and mounting losses, FIFA, world soccer’s governing body, paid members of its ruling council nearly $10 million last year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/sports/soccer/fifa-council-infantino-salaries.html,1230," LONDON — Despite promises of reform and mounting losses, FIFA, world soccer's governing body, paid members of its ruling council nearly $10 million last year. According to three people with direct knowledge of the payments, FIFA, a nonprofit organization, paid each of the elected representatives on its 37-member council $250,000 salaries, plus tens of thousands of dollars more in travel expenses, in 2017. The people asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to disclose the information before FIFA officially releases it in March. That level of compensation — for a council that is scheduled to meet only three times this year — far exceeds payments for similar work at some of the world's largest for-profit companies. It also appears to contradict the pledges, made repeatedly by FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, since his election in 2016, to restore the organization's credibility by implementing fiscal discipline. With the World Cup in Russia only months away, FIFA is entering a crucial period, as it tries to convince the fans, media partners and sponsors who make it a $1 billion-per-year operation that its culture has changed from the corrupt organization described in a series of indictments unsealed by United States prosecutors in 2015. With most of FIFA's top leaders ousted after those scandals, Infantino won a special election for the presidency in 2016, promising both to reform the organization and increase its annual payments to member associations. The continuing generosity that FIFA shows toward the members of its ruling council calls into question how serious it is about reforming itself, two and a half years after those indictments and reports of other secret payments to top executives toppled the Zurich-based organization's leadership, including its former President Sepp Blatter, his one-time heir apparent Michel Platini and Blatter's top deputy, Jérôme Valcke. ""There should be, especially for a nonprofit, some sort of justification for the sum,"" said Alexandra Wrage, president of the corporate governance adviser Trace International. Wrage previously advised FIFA about corporate governance reforms before quitting in 2013. She has since become one of the organization's loudest critics. ""I don't see the justification in the résumés, I don't see the justification in market pressure,"" Wrage said of the payments to the board members. ""It's hard to understand."" The FIFA Council replaced a previous 25-person executive committee, part of an effort by FIFA to reshape its top level of management after the arrests of some of its former executive committee members. FIFA's board is drawn from soccer's six regional confederations. In addition to their salaries, members receive additional $150 per diem payments as well as business-class travel and accommodation while attending FIFA meetings and events. According to the accounting firm KPMG, the average pay for executives who perform similar roles for Britain's top 100 listed companies is 60,000 pounds, or about $81,000. Lodestone Global, which helps firms to design boards of directors, stated in a report that analyzed 331 companies in 39 countries that nonexecutive directors for private companies of comparable size to FIFA should receive about $48,000 a year. In fact, the $250,000 base compensation for a FIFA Council seat represents a degree of belt-tightening. Previous members of the executive committee received at least $300,000 in annual pay and perks, including $500-per-day allowances and first-class air travel for them and their partners. The details of this year's salaries are expected to be made public when FIFA publishes its 2017 financial statement. The organization has taken a financial hit from its legal problems, accruing more than $100 million in legal fees during the past two years. It has also struggled to entice sponsors to attach their brands to the World Cup, a concern after a group of veteran sponsors decided not to renew their agreements. Last spring, FIFA announced a $369 million loss for 2016 and said it expected that number to climb higher in 2017. While it has grown in size, the influence of the governing board has diminished considerably since the days of the executive committee. That group had the power to make FIFA's most important decision: where to stage the World Cup. FIFA Council members do not have that privilege; instead, FIFA's full membership will vote on such matters moving forward. Infantino is making further plans to assign other major decisions to a seven-person group he will lead with the six regional confederation heads. Typically there is very little dissent at FIFA's board meetings, and council members rarely raise their voice during discussions, according to several current and former officials who have taken part in them. Resolutions are usually passed without a formal vote. Also, board members are more limited in their ability to secure perks and additional bonuses than they were in the past. FIFA has eliminated the pension plans it once paid to former executive committee members, and, unlike at the last World Cup in Brazil, its officials will not have 24-hour access to limousines in Russia. However, FIFA still falls well short of industry standards. On its website, it says that the council is ""a nonexecutive, supervisory and strategic body that sets the vision for FIFA and global football."" Yet nonexecutive board members of businesses the size of FIFA — which generates about $5.5 billion per four-year World Cup cycle — earn far less for their roles, according to surveys by some of the world's leading professional services companies. In fact, organizations like FIFA should not pay board members anything beyond their expenses, according to guidelines published by the National Council of Nonprofits, which is based in Washington. The council has argued that nonprofit board members should serve voluntarily and not benefit from their service. For example, the International Olympic Committee, another Swiss-based group that rivals FIFA for global prominence, pays executive board members and commission chairmen and chairwomen $900 a day when working or traveling on Olympic business. Asian soccer officials get $50,000 for serving on the board's confederation. Board members for Europe's soccer governing body, UEFA, reportedly receive $100,000 a year. Money has been a central feature in Infantino's rise to the top job at FIFA. In his successful election pitch, he promised a fourfold increase in development funds. But as he talked regularly about reform, Infantino last year forced out the former Portuguese politician he had hired to lead those governance reforms. The official, Miguel Maduro, said he lost his job when he resisted pressure to clear candidates backed by FIFA's leadership. ""There is a huge structural conflict of interest at the heart of FIFA: its leaders depend for their survival on those whom they ought to reform,"" Maduro wrote in an editorial written with two former colleagues who quit the FIFA governance committee he led to protest his removal. Infantino's 2017 salary and that of his deputy, the secretary general Fatma Samoura, also will be reported at the meeting in March. Infantino initially worked without a salary after describing as insulting an offer of $2 million — $1 million less than Blatter, his predecessor, had earned in his final year. Infantino later accepted $1.5 million for 2016, though FIFA agreed to restore a bonus component starting in 2017. The size of that bonus remains unclear. After the World Cup in Brazil, held a year before his ouster in 2015, Blatter was awarded a $12 million bonus. He had lined up a performance bonus in the same amount had he completed a successful 2015-19 presidential term."
News,2018-01-09,"WASHINGTON — In the wake of a deep economic crisis and a disappointingly slow recovery, a growing number of experts, including some Federal Reserve officials, say it is time for the Fed to consider a new approach to managing the economy.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/federal-reserve-inflation.html,1290," WASHINGTON — In the wake of a deep economic crisis and a disappointingly slow recovery, a growing number of experts, including some Federal Reserve officials, say it is time for the Fed to consider a new approach to managing the economy. Since the mid-1990s, the Fed has focused on keeping inflation slow and steady, at about 2 percent a year, in the belief that it was the best way to nurture economic growth and avoid painful downturns. Those pushing for a new approach do not agree on the best alternative — the ideas range from minor tweaks to tossing the current rule book — but there is broad agreement that the Fed should seize the moment now, before the next crisis hits. ""Monetary policy has not been as successful as we might like over the last decade,"" Christina Romer, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said this weekend at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Philadelphia. ""Now really is the time for every monetary economist to say, 'Is there something better?'"" The stakes are high: The Fed pursues its goals by raising and lowering borrowing costs to influence economic growth and stability. Effective management allows the economy to prosper: Employment grows, wages rise and people enjoy better standards of living. Mistakes cause recessions. The Fed has faced questions about its methods in the decade since the 2008 crisis, but in recent weeks, officials have shown a willingness to welcome the debate. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said it was time to talk about approach because the Fed is finally wrapping up its response to the last crisis, which entailed unprecedented steps to lower borrowing costs and get financial markets moving. ""The right timing of this debate is really now because the U.S. economy has fully recovered from this recession,"" Mr. Williams said. Patrick Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, told attendees at the economics gathering in Philadelphia that there was an urgent need for more and better research on the available alternatives. ""The most important issue on the table right now is that we need to consider the possibility of a new economic normal that forces us to re-evaluate our targets,"" he said. ""It is a question for the profession itself, and we do need people thinking about this."" The Fed's current approach is known as inflation targeting. It works in large part by training the public to expect a certain level of inflation, disciplining the pricing decisions of businesses and the wage demands of workers. It is, in other words, a self-fulfilling prophecy. The Fed announced in January 2012 that it would seek to keep inflation at a 2 percent annual pace, formalizing its implicit target since the mid-1990s. The rise of inflation targeting reflected a consensus among academics and policymakers that central banks did not have direct control over broader economic performance but did exercise direct control over inflation, and that keeping inflation low and stable was the best way to support growth. Most central banks in developed nations similarly target a low rate of inflation, taking the view that unpredictable increases in prices are economically disruptive. The European Central Bank, for example, aims to keep inflation ""below, but close to"" 2 percent. But the Fed's focus on inflation in the real economy did not prevent asset prices like mortgage-backed bonds from soaring to unsustainable heights before 2008, and concern about keeping inflation low limited the scope of its post-crisis stimulus campaign. Moreover, the combination of low inflation and modest growth has left the Fed with very little room to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates. During past downturns, the Fed lowered rates by an average of five percentage points. But the Fed's benchmark rate currently sits in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. That would make cutting the rate a less effective tool than in previous firefights. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's outgoing chairwoman, has emphasized that the Fed has other weapons in its arsenal. After 2008, the Fed bought large quantities of Treasuries and mortgage bonds and promised to keep interest rates low for years at a time, encouraging borrowing by businesses and consumers. Ms. Yellen is expected to be succeeded by Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor who is awaiting Senate confirmation as the next Fed chairman. Some outside economists say the Fed is putting a brave face on a bad situation. ""We are living in a singularly brittle context in which we do not have a basis for assuming that monetary policy will be able as rapidly as possible to lift us out of the next recession,"" said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary. The proposed alternatives to inflation targeting can be sorted into two categories. The first contains one simple idea: The Fed should permanently embrace higher inflation. The second is full of complicated ideas for temporarily embracing higher inflation during downturns. Olivier Blanchard, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who began his term as president of the American Economic Association at the Philadelphia meeting, said the choice of a 2 percent target had no particular economic logic to recommend it. Raising the target to 4 percent would give the Fed more room to operate without significantly larger economic costs, he said. Many economists, however, are wary of the simple solution. Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, has warned that the costs of dropping a new anchor would be significant. On Monday, at a Brookings Institution conference convened to discuss alternatives to the 2 percent target, Mr. Bernanke dismissed a 4 percent target as politically untenable. ""The Fed is not going to adopt a 4 percent inflation target,"" he said. ""It's just not going to happen."" But Mr. Bernanke has added his name to the list of those seeking an alternative to the current system. Last year, he proposed that the Fed should announce that it would temporarily tolerate higher inflation during future economic recoveries. A mechanized version of that idea, popular in some academic circles, would instruct the Fed to target an alternative economic measure, nominal gross domestic product, or N.G.D.P., which sums inflation and real economic growth. Under a 4 percent N.G.D.P. target, for example, the Fed would aim for a combination of inflation and growth that equaled 4 percent, such as 2 percent inflation and 2 percent growth. During a period of lower inflation, like the last decade, such a target would require the Fed to dictate more aggressive stimulus. Some are skeptical that the Fed can improve the economy by trying harder. Atif Mian, an economist at Princeton University, has argued in his research that high levels of household debt are limiting the impact of monetary policy because many households cannot or will not continue borrow. ""There is this implicit assumption that things will have traction if you just push hard enough,"" Mr. Mian said. ""But what is the mechanism through which this will raise actual G.D.P.?"" Indeed, the Fed and other central banks have not even succeeded in hitting their 2 percent targets in recent years, for reasons that remain unclear. Inflation in the United States has been below that level for the last six years, although most Fed policymakers continue to predict that higher inflation is around the corner. Ms. Romer said more ambitious targets might encourage central banks to try harder to stimulate inflation. In practice, she said, the Fed could have purchased more Treasuries and mortgage bonds as part of its response to the crisis, or even engaged in direct lending to businesses. ""We should not just assume that what we've done for the last 25 years is right,"" she said."

It was circle time, and Kelly was trying to get each of her 13 tiny students to articulate a feeling. ""Good morning, good morning, and how do you do?"" she sang softly to the little boy. ""Jamal's silly! Amir's happy! And how about you?"" Kelly's classroom was known for what one visiting specialist called its ""singsonginess."" The good-morning bit was standard fare, but Kelly also sang her own impromptu ditties throughout the day. She'd found that a good melody could cajole even her most obstinate students into completing dreaded tasks: There was a song about washing hands, and one about cleaning up messes, and another about how shouting and running were for outside only. Most children squealed with delight when their turn came to name a feeling: They offered up happys and sillys with abandon. Even the more bashful ones, who had to be prompted, were visibly thrilled by Kelly's attention, which seemed to beat out a limited toy-dinosaur collection as the class's chief attraction. But not the blond-haired boy. During the opening exercise, in which each child got a turn to dance in the center of the circle to a song of his choosing, he neither picked a song nor danced to the one Kelly offered. Instead, he flung himself at her feet and writhed like a fish out of water, then went completely still in a belligerent game of possum. Now, at least, Kelly had made eye contact. ""How are you today?"" she asked, holding both of his hands in hers as she spoke. ""Are you happy? Angry? Sad? Or silly?"" If any of her students — or ""little friends,"" as she called them — had sung her song back to her just then, Kelly would have answered that she was stressed. Three teachers had called out from work that morning, including the assistant teacher assigned to Kelly's room. Massachusetts state law prohibits the child-to-teacher ratio in full-day preschool classrooms from exceeding 10 to 1, so normally, Kelly had 13 students and one co-teacher. But staff shortages were a common occurrence at Springfield Arbors, where teachers earned $10 an hour on average and staff turnover was high. In practice, there was a lot of juggling: On any given day, students and teachers shuffled from one room to another, combining some classes and breaking others up in an effort to keep each room within the permissible ratio. That day, Kelly would absorb six additional students and one co-teacher from another classroom. The extra little ones didn't trouble her as much as the prospect of being stuck late again. She was supposed to be off by 4 p.m., but most of her kids didn't leave until 5:30, and the teacher who was scheduled to stay late was among those who were out. Of the teachers who were present, all either had children of their own to fetch from day care or night classes to get to at the community college. Kelly had neither. Her own kids were 17 and 20, and she had long since forgone higher education in favor of working. But none of that concerned the blond boy, who was blinking and smiling at her. Kelly kept her own eyes locked on his even as another student — a little girl with a devilish grin and a long dark ponytail — leapt onto Kelly's back and began tugging at her hairnet. ""How are you?"" Kelly asked the boy again. ""Can you tell me a feeling?"" The ponytailed girl was hardly the only one threatening to break the moment open. Someone was crying. Someone else was throwing toys not meant to be thrown and jumping on toys not meant to be jumped on. Someone smelled like poop and needed to be taken into the bathroom and guided through the basics of toilet use. And several someones were demanding things of Kelly specifically — that she hug them, or carry them round the room on her shoulders, or play a special game with just them. The children were ravenous for their teacher. And for each moment that she focused exclusively on the little blond boy, she risked losing the rest of her class to an irrevocable anarchy. To an outsider, it was tough to say which of the children's behaviors were normal for 3- and 4-year-olds and which were signs of bigger issues. Increasingly, classrooms like the one over which Kelly presides are being eyed by social scientists and policymakers as both the place where problems emerge and the safety net that stands the best chance of addressing them. Preschool is often thought of as mere babysitting. But a growing body of research suggests that when done right, it can be much more than that. An effective early-education program can level the playing field for low-income black and Hispanic students relative to their white or wealthier counterparts, so much so that gaps in language comprehension and numeracy can often disappear by the start of kindergarten. And according to at least two longitudinal studies, the very best programs can produce effects that reach far beyond those early years, increasing the rates of high-school completion and college attendance among participants and reducing the incidence of teenage parenthood, welfare dependence and arrests. The community Kelly taught in was low-income by all the standard metrics. Many of her students came from single-parent households — some from teenage mothers, at least one from foster care — and nearly all of them qualified for state-funded child care vouchers. Programs like Springfield Arbors that accepted such vouchers received about $35 a day for each child, enough to cover basics like food and art supplies but not enough to pay for on-site behavioral specialists or occupational therapists. The school did make referrals. By Massachusetts law, all 3- and 4-year-olds are eligible to receive special-needs services at the local public school; there is even a free shuttle to shepherd them back and forth. But the waiting list for those services can be long, and in the winter of 2016, few parents at the school bothered to put their children's names on it. So Kelly kept her own fractured vigil — taking note of which students couldn't control their emotions, or sit still for the life of them, or engage with others in a meaningful way — and giving those students whatever extra attention could be spared. She sometimes imagined the classroom as a bubble, inside which her students were temporarily spared from the hazards of everyday life. Her job, as she saw it, was to hold that bubble open for the ones who couldn't always hold it open themselves. ""Come on, my friend,"" she said now to the little blond boy. ""Talk to me."" The idea that we can deliberately influence the cognitive and social development of very young children is a fairly new one. In the early 20th century, some doctors considered intellectual stimulation so detrimental to infants that they routinely advised young mothers to avoid it. At the beginning of the 1960s, the prevailing wisdom was only slightly less dire. Trying to stimulate a very young mind wasn't considered dangerous so much as pointless, because 0-to-4-year-olds were ""concrete thinkers,"" incapable of theorizing or abstraction. But such thinking began to shift with two seminal preschool experiments: the HighScope Perry Preschool Study, which began in 1962 in Ypsilanti, Mich., and the Carolina Abecedarian Project, which began in 1972 in and around Chapel Hill, N.C. Perry provided free half-day classes and weekly home visits to 58 black children living in a high-poverty district near Detroit. Abecedarian provided 57 children of a similar cohort with full weekday care for their first five years of life, including not only preschool but also health care and social services. Both programs employed highly trained teachers and kept student-to-teacher ratios low. The Perry study also used a curriculum rooted in ""active participatory learning,"" in which cognitive and social skills are developed through educational games that the children themselves initiate and direct. The short-term results of these interventions were mixed. Some of the preschoolers, for example, were more aggressive at the end of the programs than they had been at the start, even if this difference disappeared by second grade. Decades later, however, when researchers went back, they found a surprise. At age 21, the Abecedarian children were half as likely to have been teenage parents and 2.5 times more likely to have enrolled in college than the control group, who did not attend preschool. At 40, the Perry children had higher median incomes than their control-group peers; they were less likely to be on welfare and less likely to have been arrested. Those results were not uniform. For example, while Perry seemed to reduce arrests and increase high-school graduation rates, Abecedarian had no impact on either. But the findings still caused a stir among social scientists and educators: Both programs appeared to have affected the children in ways that could still be seen in adulthood. In the decades since those results were published, the biological and social sciences have radically altered our understanding of early-childhood development. We now know that infants and toddlers have the capacity for complex thought. According to a recent report from the Institute of Medicine, they can understand other people's intentions, reason about cause and effect and intuit the more basic aspects of addition and subtraction. We also know that the earliest years are a period of intense and rapid neural development — M.R.I. studies suggest that 80 percent of all neural connections form by age 3 — and that a child's ability to capitalize on these years is directly related to her environment. Social scientists have shown that, owing to a shortage of books and toddler-friendly conversation, children from families on welfare understand roughly one-third the number of words that their middle-class peers do by the start of kindergarten. Scientists and educators have begun to build on this new understanding, creating pedagogy and designing curriculums around the needs of our earliest learners. But one crucial question remains unanswered: What actually works? What are the defining features of an excellent preschool education? ""There is no empirically based definition of 'high-quality preschool,' "" says Mark Lipsey, a social scientist at Vanderbilt University. ""We throw the phrase around a lot, but we don't actually know what it means."" Part of the problem is that the benefits of a preschool education tend to manifest unevenly. Developmental gains made by the start of kindergarten can be enough to close racial achievement gaps, but those gains often evaporate by third or fourth grade, a phenomenon that education researchers call the fade-out effect. And so far, the longer-term rebounds found in Perry and Abecedarian — in which children who attend good preschools fare better in adulthood than their peers who attend no such program — have been difficult to parse or replicate. In 2017, a group of prominent early-education researchers published a consensus statement declaring that preschool classrooms were a ""black box"" and that much more research was needed before anyone could say with certainty which ingredients were essential to improving long-term developmental trajectories. Amid that uncertainty, though, at least two things seem clear: Children in low-income and minority neighborhoods stand to gain (or lose) the most from whatever preschool system we ultimately establish. And the one-on-one exchanges between students and teachers — what developmental psychologists call ""process quality"" — may well be the key to success or failure. In other words, if preschool classrooms really are crackling with the kind of raw power that can change the course of a life, that power most likely resides in the ability of teachers like Kelly to connect with students like the little blond boy. But if teachers are crucial to high-quality preschool, they are also its most neglected component. Even as investment in early-childhood education soars, teachers like Kelly continue to earn as little as $28,500 a year on average, a valuation that puts them on par with file clerks and switchboard operators, but well below K-12 teachers, who, according to the most recent national survey, earn roughly $53,100 a year. According to a recent briefing from the Economic Policy Institute, a majority of preschool teachers are low-income women of color with no more than a high-school diploma. Only 15 percent of them receive employer-sponsored health insurance, and depending on which state they are in, nearly half belong to families that rely on public assistance. ""Teaching preschoolers is every bit as complicated and important as teaching any of the K-12 grades, if not more so,"" says Marcy Whitebook, a director of the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. ""But we still treat preschool teachers like babysitters. We want them to ameliorate poverty even as they live in it themselves."" The solution to this paradox seems obvious: Hold preschool teachers to the same standards as their K-12 counterparts, and pay them a salary commensurate with that training. But that proposition is rife with intractable questions. Who will pay the higher salaries? How will current teachers rise to meet the new credential requirements? And if they can't or won't, who will take their place? At the heart of those questions is this one: What, exactly, makes a good preschool teacher? Springfield Arbors preschool consists of one long hallway on the ground floor of an assisted-living facility, with several classrooms strung along either side. The surrounding neighborhood, known as Six Corners, is home to a high school (the same one that Kelly attended), a community college and a steady beat of drug- and gang-related violence. Six Corners children live on the down side of what's known in education circles as the achievement gap. According to analysis done by the Massachusetts-based nonprofit Strategies for Children, between 12 and 14 percent of third graders in some Six Corners schools read at or above grade level, compared with between 37 and 43 percent in nearby Forest Park, a neighborhood known for its well-preserved Victorian homes, and as the birthplace of Dr. Seuss, the city's most famous native son. Kelly came to preschool teaching about a decade ago, when the local caterer she was working for abruptly shut down. For a single mother with a high-school diploma, the options in Springfield were limited: Home health aides, retail salespeople and food-service workers all made about the same salary. Receptionists and secretaries made more, but those jobs required office experience, and the work itself sounded dull. Kelly wanted a job helping people. She had only ever worked in food service, but when she found a local preschool with an opening in the kitchen, she saw a chance to pivot. She started by making herself known in the classroom, lingering to help out when she delivered lunches, introducing herself to parents in the hallway, befriending the teachers and asking them about their work. When an assistant-teacher spot opened up, she jumped on it. She considered it a promotion, even though the teacher's salary ($9 an hour) was actually $1 an hour less than what she made as a school cook. For the first year, she split her time between the kitchen and the classroom while she earned her Child Development Associate certification, or C.D.A., which required her to complete a nine-month course that met for four hours every Saturday at the local Y.M.C.A. At first she thought that credential would help her carve a path to some greater edification: a higher degree, maybe, and a higher wage along with it. But those dreams were quickly jettisoned. In 2011, just as she was completing her first class at the community college, an electrical fire tore through the three-family home that Kelly and her two children shared with her grandmother, mother, aunt and cousin. Her relatives' apartments weren't damaged much, but Kelly and her children lost nearly all their possessions. Worse, the fire seemed to usher in a newly dark chapter in her life. In 2012, her younger brother died in a horrific car accident; a year later, her cousin was shot and killed, and her aunt died. Her daughter's boyfriend — the father of her newborn grandson — was also killed, in another shooting. Somewhere in the middle of those heartaches, the preschool she worked at closed, and Kelly moved on to Springfield Arbors. The C.D.A. taught her the basics of lesson planning, class structure and family engagement, but her real training came through trial and error. Kelly's classroom was often chaotic, but parents quickly learned that they could come to her with concerns, even after their children had aged out of her classroom. One mother asked her to step in as foster parent during a particularly tough time. Others hired her to babysit when they picked up night shifts at one job or another, so that Kelly might welcome a given child at 8 in the morning and not return him to his mother until well after 10 or 11 at night. The work was exhausting, but she found she had a knack for it — an instinct for what her students needed, an ability to relate to them and, when all else failed, a willingness to keep trying. One early-spring afternoon, when a rainstorm kept the children indoors during what would normally be playtime, Kelly tried arranging a field trip to the basement hallway — the only substitute playground at Springfield Arbors. But when too many of them fell into tantrum mode at the same time, she changed tack and set up the portable chalkboard at the front of the room. It did not take long for one, then three, then a dozen of the children to notice her chalking letters and gather around. The letter of the week was ""D,"" and she had been teaching the students what words it was used in and showing them how to write and pronounce it. ""Down, over, over,"" she said in a long, slow drawl, as she drew first the spine and then the hump of the letter. She was speaking to one little boy specifically, and when she was done, she handed the chalk to him and held his hand as he repeated her movements. Then she removed her hand and nodded at him to try on his own. At first, the class was enthralled by this demonstration. But then one little boy started screaming. Grandma, an elderly volunteer who sometimes came for an hour or two and mostly sat in back of the room on a small couch, grabbed the boy's arm and yanked him to her side. ""Cut it out,"" she said. ""Come sit!"" The boy yanked his arm back, flopped onto the floor and wailed. Kelly kept her focus on the students at the blackboard. Eventually the screamer ran back over to the circle and forced another little boy off his seat, which made the other boy cry, which distracted the rest of the class and set half of them wandering off, before anyone had made a full D. When nap time came it seemed impossible that any one of the tiny, furious bodies twirling through the room could be stilled long enough to let sleep come, let alone all of them at once. But the sleeping mats were soon laid out across the room, and the children took their cue, except for the little blond boy, who wouldn't lie still. One of Kelly's colleagues sat on the floor near him, urging him to calm himself. ""Relax your body,"" she said over and over, patting his back. But it was no use, so she traded spots with Kelly. Kelly leaned over the little blond boy and made eye contact with him and allowed him to grab at her hands with his. This seemed to do the trick. When he settled in just enough to release his grip, she took her cellphone out and played soft music, just for him, which clinched the deal. By the time all the children fell asleep, Kelly was sitting cross-legged on the floor with four little ones unfurled like flower petals around her. She was rubbing each of their backs in turn with one hand — rub, rub, pat, next; rub, rub, pat, next — while rocking a fifth in her other arm. Her classroom had a total of 19 students just then, and in order for her to grab lunch, the school's cook had to be summoned to sit with the sleeping children. She pulled a pack of noodles from her coat pocket and tiptoed toward the door. ""It's a ramen week,"" she whispered. ""I just spent a fortune on household stuff yesterday, and my son has two basketball games this week."" The high school charged $5 admission to each game, and Kelly rarely missed one, even when it meant skimping on meals. She returned a few minutes later with a bowl of steaming noodles and two co-teachers. As the children snoozed, the three women slipped into a whispered chat. One student's voucher was about to expire, and the student's mother had yet to contact the voucher office to renew it. They debated who was to blame for this looming catastrophe; but how the voucher office worked was a mystery, even to these women who were both mothers and teachers. ""You can't call them,"" one teacher said. ""They never answer. You have to go down there."" ""She must have missed her appointment,"" another added. ""They don't always give appointments,"" Kelly said. ""They never gave my daughter one for my grandson."" One teacher, Miss RJ, was summoned to the office: The nurse at her own children's school was calling to say that both of them were sick. But Springfield Arbors was still short-staffed. So Miss RJ was stuck there, and her own children were stuck with someone else. In the United States, the care of children who have not yet aged into public school has long run on two tracks, separated mostly by household income. The upper-and-middle-income track was designed specifically to engage and nourish young minds at their ripest juncture. The low-income track originated in the social-welfare system; its programs were created not just for children but also for their mothers, who needed to work. As such, they tend to be larger and staffed by teachers with high-school diplomas. They also tend to be chronically underfunded. The last half-century is littered with attempts to merge these two tracks — that is, to make the day cares of the poor more like the preschools of the middle class and wealthy. But those efforts have long been plagued by a deep cultural ambivalence toward both charity and working mothers. When Head Start, the nation's first public preschool, began in 1965 as part of the War on Poverty, its goals were twofold: to provide underprivileged preschoolers the tools they needed to keep up with their better-off peers; and to offer an economic boost for their mothers, some of whom were recruited and trained to work at the centers as educators. The program was part of what would come to be known as the country's biggest peacetime mobilization of human resources, but enthusiasm for it was short-lived. Amid concerns about ""family weakening"" in the 1970s and ""welfare queens"" in the 1980s, funding for early education stalled. Today Head Start serves less than one-third of the nation's eligible students. As part of a wave of reforms about a decade ago, Head Start began requiring half of its lead teachers to hold bachelor's degrees. It's too soon to tell what impact this has had on teaching and learning, but one unintended consequence is that it's harder for teachers like Kelly to find work at the centers. Head Start is not the only program to raise credentialing requirements for preschool teachers. In 1998, as a result of a lawsuit filed by the Education Law Center, an advocacy group for New Jersey public-school children, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered 31 low-income school districts to provide high-quality preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds. Among other things, the court's definition of ""high quality"" included full-day programs staffed by college-educated teachers who earned salaries equal to those of their K-12 counterparts. The resulting program — known as the Abbott preschool program, after the lawsuit that led to the mandate — represents one of the first efforts among education reformers to replicate the models of Perry and Abecedarian and bring them to scale. One recent morning in a brightly colored classroom at Egenolf, an Abbott preschool in Elizabeth, N.J. A 3-year-old girl with soft brown pigtails and a white shirt examined a row of water bottles, each of which had a pine cone submerged in a different liquid, and dictated observations to her teacher, Yamila Lopez Hevia. The cone in the ""cold water"" bottle was closing up. The one in warm water was closing, too — but more slowly. ""And what do we think is going on?"" Lopez asked. ""Why might that happen?"" After a brief pause, the girl pulled up two big words, each of which she had heard from Lopez. The pine cones, she explained, were a-dap-ting to their en-viron-ment. It was the crowning moment to a much larger project that began when the children noticed that it was getting colder out and that the leaves were changing color. Lopez led them through a dialogue about how trees and other plants get ready for winter. From there, they turned their attention to what animals do. Lopez took the class to a local park, where they noticed squirrels collecting nuts and looked for birds who might be getting ready to migrate. In the end, they circled back to themselves, discussing sweaters and warm coats and winter boots. ""We introduced some big concepts,"" Lopez told me when I visited her class recently. ""And it all started with that one simple question: 'What do you see happening around you?' "" The technique was called scaffolding, and it was a key tenet of current preschool pedagogy, which Lopez learned as a student teacher. According to that pedagogy, preschoolers discover the world around them through trial, error and experimentation. They learn by doing things more than by thinking about them. The techniques that educators and developmental psychologists have devised for cultivating this natural tendency are decidedly Socratic. Rather than standing at a blackboard chalking letters or leading a large group in song, they assert, teachers like Kelly and Lopez should pay close attention to what the children themselves are interested in, or puzzled by, and respond to that. Any given moment is ripe with the opportunity to teach in this way, but doing it well requires a suite of disparate skills. A squirrel collecting nuts for the winter might hold a biology lesson; but to offer that lesson, a teacher needs to recognize the moment as it occurs. She also needs a grounding in that discipline and a clear sense of where the student in question sits on the developmental spectrum. ""The bottom line is really individualized intentional teaching,"" says Steven Barnett, co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University. ""And there's specialized knowledge that preschool teachers need that's different even from what kindergarten and first-grade teachers need."" For example, he says, preschoolers are apt to reverse letters. ""It really helps to understand why they do that, if you want to help them get it right,"" he says. ""It's not an isolated thing. Like, let's take my sippy cup. My whole life up to now, my sippy cup is a sippy cup no matter what way I hold it — upside down, sideways, whatever. But now you give me this thing called a d. And I put it down one way and it's a b. And another way and you tell me it's a p. What's with that?"" Barnett and others say that the ability to guide preschoolers through this stage of development takes a college degree. Teachers who don't have rich vocabularies or groundings in math and science can't impart those things to their students, he says. In a 2015 report, the Institute of Medicine agreed. The report argued that holding preschool teachers to lower standards than public-school teachers has fed the perception that the work itself is low-skill and in turn has helped justify policies that keep preschool teachers' wages down and prevent them from growing professionally. But teachers themselves have been divided over the prospect of new job requirements. Many of them migrated to the field precisely because it did not require a higher degree. College — navigating financial aid, carving out the hours for class and homework — takes time and money and know-how. And for those who have been doing the job for years or even decades, the suggestion that they need additional training can feel like an insult. Abbott addressed these issues head-on. It provided intensive college-admissions counseling, including help with financial-aid forms and scheduling. It also covered tuition for teachers in the program and nudged the college programs to bring their classes to the preschools. ""We had the college professors go into the Newark schools and hold their classes there so that the teachers didn't have to travel,"" Barnett says. ""We also paid for substitutes when the teachers needed to go to classes during the day, because we knew that not everybody could do this at night school."" The process was neither cheap nor easy nor fast, he adds. Many teachers struggled through remedial courses and community college before making their way into bachelor's degree programs. All told, it costs $14,000 per child per year, more than twice the national average. Those figures have made Abbott a lightning rod in the debate over public preschool in general and teacher credentials in particular. Critics say that the program is far too expensive given how little it may affect student outcomes in the long term (Abbott studies show fade-out effects, albeit less significant ones than in many other preschool studies). But proponents argue that it's unfair to judge the success or value of such programs by performance in the middle-school or high-school years — in part because there may be rebound effects later on. And in any case, the program works demonstrably well in achieving its primary objective: preparing children for elementary school. It has also helped stabilize the preschool work force. Because Abbott teachers earn solid middle-class salaries — between $55,000 and $57,000 per year on average — staff turnover is less of a problem, which in turn means that classrooms are less chaotic. This latter benefit underscores all the others: A successful preschool teacher needs to make her students feel safe and help them understand their emotions and regulate their own behavior. Children can't concentrate long enough to absorb new ideas or develop new skills if every slight sets them off crying or swinging at other children, or if they feel constantly threatened or mistrustful of their surroundings. And teachers who earn poverty-level wages can't be expected to create consistent and reassuring classrooms. ""Security is an essential foundation for early learning,"" says Whitebook of U.C. Berkeley. ""An older kid might be able to learn about math or history from a teacher they don't like. But a young child, a preschool-aged child, is going to have a very hard time learning anything from an adult that they feel averse to. For very young children especially, you have to meet them where they are, both literally and figuratively, and you have to make them feel safe in that space."" Little of what experts like Barnett and Whitebook espouse would surprise Kelly, who in the time I spent in her classroom seemed always to be on bended knee, talking one child or another through their tears, gently but firmly explaining the reality of other people's feelings or helping them understand the relationships between their physical behavior and its consequences. One day, I watched her spend a full 15 minutes on a small boy in bright orange shorts who had gotten in the habit of tearing through the room at full speed. In the course of a morning, he had knocked two little girls to the ground and destroyed a block city that two other children were building. The assistant teacher had threatened him with suspension from class, to no avail. Kelly, applying the same squat-down-direct-eye-contact treatment that she used on the blond-haired boy, led him through a string of questions: ""What happens when we run?"" ""We go fast!"" ""What else happens?"" ""We ... hit things?"" ""Why do we hit things when we run fast, but not when we walk?"" ""Because ... it takes longer to stop!"" From there they discussed how barreling into a person might make that person feel. Eventually the boy concluded that it was best to save fast running for outside, where there was more space. It was as good a lesson in physics and feelings as any 4-year-old was likely to get, in any school. But later that day, the same little boy found himself puzzling over another riddle of movement and speed. It was recess, and the class was scattered across the narrow strip of wood chips and strewn toys that constituted the Springfield Arbors playground. The boy in orange shorts huddled with three other boys in a cubbyhole at the base of a plastic fort. The group whispered and drew in the dirt with twigs for several minutes before abruptly bursting out across the yard. They took possession of a large rubber ball from some uninterested girls and set about throwing it as high as they could. The boy in the orange shorts took several consecutive turns, throwing the ball higher each time. When it landed atop a tarp that was fastened to the side of the building, the boys exchanged giddy confused looks: Why had the ball landed there instead of on the ground? What should they do next? The boy looked across the playground toward Kelly, but she was busy brokering a time-share deal between two archrivals over the class's only Malibu Barbie. If there was a shortcoming to Kelly's work, it was that her skills were almost always deployed to resolve a crisis or defuse tension, and rarely to nurture some budding curiosity. Kelly didn't doubt the vastness of her students' inner mental worlds; nor did she discount the importance of meeting them where they were or of treating them with frankness and intelligence. In fact, she seemed to grasp those principles intuitively. What she lacked was the support she needed to build on her natural talents or cultivate her own ambitions. One such ambition was taking more of a leadership role at the center. In April 2016, she was unofficially promoted from lead teacher to assistant director — an office job that came with a small raise. But then in June, two teachers quit and another was fired, and she was sent back to the classroom. ""I feel like I can't move forward,"" she told me at the time. ""I keep picking up slack for all these other people moving forward with their careers, and their lives. And I'm stuck."" That feeling had become more pronounced lately, owing to a string of incidents outside the classroom. First was the robbery: When she and her daughter stopped at the bank one evening after work, they were held at gunpoint by a man in a ski mask demanding all the money behind the counter. The entire episode passed in 15 minutes. But while Kelly's daughter compartmentalized it quickly, Kelly replayed it in her head for weeks, enumerating to herself all the ways that trouble had nearly missed them: She did not normally stop at that branch, but had taken a different route home to run an errand. They had been about to leave; Kelly's hands were on the door when the gunman came through it from the other side, thrusting his weapon in her face. He was never caught, but the Springfield Police Department sent the Kelly household a pamphlet on how to deal with the aftermath of a robbery. Then, as summer approached, Kelly received a summons asking her to testify in a murder trial. The actual killing took place in 2013, on her brother's birthday. It was the first of his birthdays since his death, and Kelly and her sister were sitting up in her sister's kitchen, weathering the internal storm that such anniversaries tend to bring, when they heard shots. Kelly looked down from the second-story window to find a gaggle of teenagers, including her nephew, scrambling for cover. She grabbed every glass object she could get her hands on — plates, vases, dishes — and hurled them out the window at the gunman, ducking in between throws to protect herself. When the shooting stopped, she and her sister ran out to the street, where they found one boy down. Kelly gave him CPR, and even got him back to breathing for a few minutes, but he died before the ambulance arrived. In addition to reminding her of that day, the court summons had the effect of putting her children on edge; there had already been more than one shooting in their neighborhood that summer, and it was never good to be the only person standing between an accused killer and a possible life sentence. Kelly prided herself on setting those worries aside when she was at work. But with each fresh calamity, she felt the walls of her own bubble closing in. One late afternoon, as fall tipped into winter, a squirrel perched itself on the ledge just outside Kelly's classroom window and caught the attention of a small boy with milk-chocolate skin and big, round eyes. He pointed at the animal, silently but with gusto. When Kelly walked by, he tugged at the leg of her pants. She scooped him up, rested him on her hip and, for a brief moment, watched with him as the creature scurried up and down a tree at the playground's edge. ""Yes,"" she said. ""That's a squirrel."" The boy continued to point, but it was late in the day, and Kelly was tired and distracted, so the conversation ended there. In the fall of 2017, Kelly and her colleagues received word that Springfield Arbors preschool would change owners this January, and become Bright Futures. No one could say for sure what that meant for the teachers or their students. The anxiety surrounding this change reflected an uncertainty that reached far beyond Kelly's classroom. In the last decade or so, the percentage of children served by state programs has doubled; 43 states and the District of Columbia now have public preschool programs of one kind or another. But that recent progress is now being tempered by federal indifference: The Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has yet to appoint a director of the Office of Early Learning, established under the Obama administration to help facilitate the integration of preschool into the public-education system; and President Trump has eliminated preschool funding increases from his proposed budget. What's more, experts are still divided over what credentials early childhood educators should have. Last year, for instance, the District of Columbia school district took a step toward professionalizing its preschool work force when it declared that all preschool teachers would be required to obtain an associate degree by 2020. The measure met with controversy even among some preschool proponents. One argument holds that preschool teachers with college educations have not been shown to improve students' educational outcomes compared with those who do not have degrees but have been trained in child development. ""The evidence for a B.A. is pretty weak,"" says Bruce Fuller, an education researcher at U.C. Berkeley. ""It probably screens for people who engage in richer language, but the actual training in college — I'm not sure it has any effect."" The other argument is that increasing credential requirements without first raising wages places too much of a burden on already-overtaxed teachers. Mary Alice McCarthy, director of the Center on Education and Skills at the New America foundation, has proffered a different approach: apprenticeships. Like many human-service jobs, she says, teaching is best taught through ""iterative interactions,"" where a person with experience helps a newcomer identify and respond to challenges. And the structure of an apprenticeship may be better suited to teachers who need to work full time while they learn. ""You can't say the goal is to level the playing field for low-income kids,"" McCarthy says, ""and then cut low-income teachers who have been doing this work forever out of the equation."" Amy O'Leary, a former preschool teacher and current campaign director for Strategies for Children, agrees: ""The existing preschool work force is much more diverse than the elementary work force, and we want to preserve that,"" she says. ""If you hire only those teachers who have the means to do it on their own, you displace the existing ones, who often come from the communities they teach in and have their own specialized knowledge of what it is to live in neighborhoods like Six Corners."" A Philadelphia-area community college, a union and a number of local preschools joined forces to make the first attempts at training preschool teachers in this way. The program pairs apprentice teachers with mentors as they progress through a structured curriculum while working in the classroom full time. They get four wage increases over a two-year period, so that by the time they complete the program, which grants them both an associate degree and a journeyman card, they are already earning $2 to $3 more an hour. ""That's a life-changing increase,"" McCarthy says. It's also classroom-changing. The program is still in its infancy, but I spoke with apprentices, teachers and center directors who say that improvements in classroom dynamics and staff turnover, not to mention actual teaching, are already apparent. ""I feel like I've learned more about how their little brains work, and also about the best ways to reach them,"" says Briana Gonsiewski, an apprentice at Spin preschool in Philadelphia, who taught for 10 years before joining the program in 2017. ""Before, I did not see playing on the ground as something structural. Now I get how they are really learning all the time, and I can start to see how to tap into that."" It will take a few years more to say how the apprentice program stacks up against programs like Abbott, or even like Springfield Arbors, and if the teacher training affects student outcomes in any measurable way. And then individual communities will have to decide if the gains are worth the price. ""We have to come to terms with the fact that this is going to cost a lot more money,"" O'Leary says. ""And to accept that, I think we still have to shed a lot of prejudices about working mothers and the working poor, and what it means to help them."" In the meantime, with limited funds, policymakers and educators are caught between competing imperatives: Use the money they have to expand access so that as many students as possible receive some form of early education, or use it to improve quality in specific places like Six Corners, where both the need and potential payoff are greatest. Investing in teacher education, as Abbott or the apprenticeship programs do, means choosing the latter, and that's a tough sell to taxpayers who need child care themselves. ""Politicians are understandably reluctant to tell parents who need to work and who are on the waiting list for subsidies, 'Well, we're not going to expand access this year, because we are putting that money into quality,' "" Barnett says. ""It's true that the lowest-income areas stand to benefit the most from good preschools. But it's not just the very poor that are struggling. The story of inequality is increasingly that the very rich are leaving everyone else behind."" For now, Kelly and hers were making do. Her son was accepted at six of the 10 colleges he applied to. He had qualified for some scholarship money, which would help bring his tuition down, but Kelly was scrambling to come up with the rest. She had found a second job working nights and weekends at Kohl's, and was cutting corners where she could. One such economy was her car: a 2001 Buick Park Avenue, bought from a friend for $700. The engine was solid, but the gas meter was busted, so that you had to pay very close attention to the amount of driving you did relative to the amount of money you had put in the tank, or you'd end up stranded. Kelly learned this the hard way one evening. After a day filled with staff shortages and screaming children, she was heading through Six Corners toward home when the car sputtered to a stop. Both snow and darkness were falling fast, but there was a gas station just two miles up the road. Kelly called her daughter to say she'd be home late. Then she fished a plastic container from the trunk, hunched her back against the cold and set out for the long walk by herself."
News,2018-01-09,Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching:,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/business/dealbook/jana-apple-tech.html,2558," Good Tuesday. Here's what we're watching: • Kodak plans to create its own virtual currency. • President Trump plans to attend the World Economic Forum. • Just how rich is Jeff Bezos? • The shine is coming off the tech industry more and more. • Talk of an Oprah presidential run has boosted at least one company. Want this in your own email inbox? Here's the sign-up. Shares of Kodak surged 34 percent after the company said it said it was launching a ""major blockchain initiative."" The company and WENN Digital announced the creation of KODAKOne, an image rights management platform, and KODAKCoin, a virtual token ""to allow photographers and agencies to take greater control in image rights management."" ""For many in the tech industry, 'blockchain' and 'cryptocurrency' are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who've long struggled to assert control over their work and how it's used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem,"" said Jeff Clarke, Kodak's chief executive. Erik Holm of MoneyBeat writes: ""For the past several years, people have been experimenting with ways to adapt the technology behind bitcoin, usually called blockchain. At its essence, blockchain is an open record of transactions, maintained in an online ledger that is distributed across a network of computers, that cannot be tampered with. That makes it like an indelible timestamp, which could be useful in a case of copyright and digital rights management."" Kodak plans to hold an initial coin offering for KODAKCoin on Jan. 31. Coin offerings, which allow companies to raise money by creating their own private digital currency through a form of online crowdfunding, have surged in popularity during the past 12 months. Kodak's shares are just the latest to get a digital currency boost. The stocks of a number of companies have surged in recent months after those firms rebranded themselves as having something to do digital currencies or blockchain. Critic's corner: Kodak is ""betting its future on digital currencies with an initial coin offering designed to help photographers sell their work. The crypto buzz more than doubled its stock, but it's unlikely to do anything like the same to the company's sales or profit,"" writes Tom Buerkle of Breakingviews. — Stephen Grocer The chief executive of Renault-Nissan has escalated the auto industry's technology-driven arms race. The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance said Tuesday it is setting up a venture capital fund to invest $1 billion in automotive technologies over the next five years. Mr. Ghosn pushed for the fund ""to speed development of technologies that the three automakers don't have in-house,"" the WSJ reported. More about the fund: • It's named Alliance Ventures. • Francois Dossa is leading the fund and will have teams in Silicon Valley, Paris, Japan and China looking for startups in which to invest. • The fund has already invested in Ionic Materials, a Woburn, Mass., startup working to develop solid-state batteries. Automakers have poured money into automobile technology startups in recent years. General Motors bought Cruise Automation in a deal potentially valued at more than $1 billion. Last summer Toyota set up a $100 million investing arm called Toyota AI Ventures. From Reuters: ""The traditional auto industry model based on individual ownership is threatened by pay-per-use services such as Uber, as well as ride- and car-sharing platforms, a challenge heightened by parallel shifts towards electrified and self-driving cars."" From The New York Times: Stephen K. Bannon is stepping down from his post as executive chairman of Breitbart News, the company announced Tuesday. Mr. Bannon's departure, which was forced by a onetime financial patron, Rebekah Mercer, comes as Mr. Bannon remained unable to quell the furor over remarks attributed to him in a new book in which he questions President Trump's mental fitness and disparages his elder son, Donald Trump Jr. Mr. Bannon's departure from the website is the latest ignominious turn in a career that was once one of the most promising and improbable in modern American politics. Here's what White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Maggie Haberman and Michael Shear of the NYT: ""At this year's World Economic Forum, the president looks forward to promoting his policies to strengthen American businesses, American industries, and American workers."" He'll be the first U.S. president to do so since Bill Clinton in 2000. The BBC previously noted that Ronald Reagan spoke to the crowd at the World Economic Forum via videoconference, but that neither of the Bushes nor Barack Obama attended. (Joe Biden did, however.) Why? As the NYT adds, presidents have been concerned that being seen rubbing shoulders with some of the world's wealthiest might send the wrong political message. (Other heads of state, like Xi Jinping of China, have attended.) One additional note: Having attended the forum a few times, I'd say that one thing that a visit from Mr. Trump would definitely do is make the traffic in Davos during the event — which often moves at a glacial pace as V.I.P.'s vehicular escorts crawl through the windy streets — probably more difficult. — Michael J. de la Merced Shot: ""Jeff Bezos is now the richest person of all time,"" CNN reported. (The Bloomberg article that the news item cited makes no such claim.) Chaser: — Michael J. de la Merced Let's count the ways: • Apple is being pressed to protect young users from smartphone addiction by an unusual coalition: the hedge fund Jana Partners and the California public pension fund Calstrs. • Alphabet, Facebook and Twitter are under scrutiny over Russia's use of social media to manipulate elections. • Amazon is facing scrutiny for its effect on jobs. • Europe is examining many U.S. tech companies on competition and privacy grounds. As Barry Rosenstein, the managing partner of Jana, told David Gelles of the NYT: ""As more and more founders of the biggest tech companies are acknowledging today, the days of just throwing technology out there and washing your hands of the potential impact are over."" The growing fear about tech addiction: Two former Facebook executives, Sean Parker and Chamath Palihapitiya, spoke last year about how the company hooks into users' psyches. And Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, held a briefing on the issue. (Axios has more.) One place you don't yet see a problem: These companies' stocks. Apple's shares dipped only slightly yesterday, and its market capitalization is still just shy of $900 billion. Shares in Facebook, Alphabet and Twitter gained slightly. Critics' corner • Shira Ovide writes, ""When financial mercenaries start caring about the potential human harm of technology, Silicon Valley should be extremely nervous."" (Gadfly) • Jennifer Saba writes of Jana's campaign, ""It's an unusual issue for an activist, and apps from Facebook and Snap would make better targets."" (Breakingviews) Shares in the weight-loss company, of which Ms. Winfrey owns 10 percent, jumped as much as 13 percent yesterday amid speculation that she may run for president. Not everyone was as euphoric about the possibility. Here's what Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist, told the NYT: ""Beating Trump isn't just about finding the right candidate — we have to show what we stand for,"" Ms. Katz said. ""Other than 'we all get a car,' what will an Oprah presidency look like?"" she added, referring to when Ms. Winfrey famously gave a car to every audience member at her show. It comes down to how they respond to the provision that taxes the income of overseas subsidiaries at half the domestic rate — even as Mr. Trump has promised to bring jobs back to struggling cities. Companies have a new reason to move plants abroad, Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT reports: ""Having such a low rate on foreign income is outrageous,"" said Stephen E. Shay, a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School and a Treasury Department official during the Reagan and Obama administrations. ""It creates terrible incentives."" The caveat: Some companies may want to stay, for America's legal system and skilled workers. But big manufacturers like auto companies may be tempted to move anyway.

(Politico) Federal regulators blocked an Energy Department proposal to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear power plants. That raises questions about what else the Trump administration can do to prop up an industry that — even as pollution regulations loosen — is being battered by market forces. More from Brad Plumer of the NYT: Last year, utilities announced plans to shut down more than 22 gigawatts of coal capacity across the country, and more retirements are expected this year. Mr. Perry's proposal was the most aggressive move yet in support of coal and nuclear power and would have shielded a number of plants in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic from those competitive forces. The policy flyaround • A Senate resolution to block the F.C.C.'s repeal of net neutrality rules has enough support to force a vote — but the House is unlikely to follow suit.

Its founder and C.E.O., Nick Woodman, cut his cash salary to $1. The company's shares climbed back amid news reports that it had hired JPMorgan Chase to run a sales process. But Mr. Woodman eventually told Bloomberg that while JPMorgan is the company's main bank, GoPro wasn't actively looking to sell itself. GoPro's problem: It's too dependent on its action cameras, according to Dan Gallagher of Heard on the Street. Some investors have apparently decided that protecting themselves against a decline in the markets is a waste of money, Gunjan Banerji of the WSJ reports: ""I haven't seen hedging activity this light since the end of the financial crisis,"" said Peter Cecchini, a New York-based chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. ""It started in late 2016 and accelerated in the second half of the year."" At the same time, analysts have raised their forecasts for corporate profits as fast as they have in a decade.

News,2018-01-09,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to attend the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, in the coming weeks, an administration official said on Tuesday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/politics/trump-davos-world-economic-forum.html,898," WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to attend the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, in the coming weeks, an administration official said on Tuesday. In a statement, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the president was looking forward to attending the gathering of world leaders and business executives. ""The president welcomes opportunities to advance his America First agenda with world leaders,"" Ms. Sanders said. ""At this year's World Economic Forum, the president looks forward to promoting his policies to strengthen American businesses, American industries and American workers."" Mr. Trump's planned appearance at an event that is synonymous with wealth and elite prestige comes as he enters the second year of a term he won on a message of economic populism. Presidents have rarely attended the forum in Davos, in part out of a concern that it would send the wrong message to be rubbing shoulders with some of the world's richest individuals. Mr. Trump won the 2016 election in part by attacking elites in the United States and promising to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington of lobbyists, corporate influence and members of the establishment — the very description of those who regularly attend the Davos forum. The event in Switzerland is a global symbol of everything that Mr. Trump's former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, railed against during the presidential campaign and the first seven months in the administration. But Mr. Trump has also spent a lifetime as a real estate mogul and television personality seeking to be accepted by the financial and media elite in New York and around the world. His decision to travel to Davos as president may represent his desire to prove that he has achieved that goal. Some of Mr. Trump's advisers were befuddled by his planned trip, coming a year after his team decided not to send a representative to the 2017 gathering. A year into his term, Mr. Trump's appearance at the forum is certain to highlight the clash between his America First agenda and the more globalist approach of some of America's closest allies around the world. Those disagreements have been highlighted during Mr. Trump's earlier trips abroad, including arguments with European leaders about the need for action to confront climate change. Mr. Trump's visit to Asia last year underscored his disagreements on trade issues with countries in the region. Many of the participants at Davos are sure to embrace the globalist views that Mr. Trump has rejected, providing the potential for dramatic disagreements between the president and others at the meeting. But the event — which often focuses on global economic issues — also will provide Mr. Trump with a platform to boast about the improving American economy, including the rise in the stock market and the low jobless rate. The president has eagerly claimed credit for the economic improvements during his first year in office, and has predicted that the tax overhaul passed at the end of last year would accelerate those trends. The annual economic forum takes place in the resort town of Davos high in the Swiss Alps, bringing together more than 3,000 members of the global elite in what has been described as the world's most high-powered networking event. Those who attend include journalists and columnists, Hollywood celebrities, researchers, corporate chief executive officers and other business titans, and some heads of state. Former President Bill Clinton attended the forum in 2000 and former president George W. Bush attended a meeting of the Word Economic Forum in Egypt in 2008. But former President Barack Obama did not attend the meetings during the time he was in the White House. Founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a German economics professor, the forum has become an annual meeting that includes dinners and over 400 panel discussion sessions, largely about world social and economic trends. Officially, it is an academic conference; unofficially it is a global schmoozefest for the rich and powerful. The conference is still dominated by corporate executives, but the gathering also now attracts world leaders, some of whom use the venue as a way to hold less formal bilateral conversations. Last year, President Xi Jinping of China attended the forum, which began just days before Mr. Trump's inauguration, becoming the first Chinese leader to mingle with the corporate and media crowd in the mountain village. In a speech at the forum, Mr. Xi portrayed his country as a global leader interested in free trade at a time that Mr. Trump was already calling for a turn inward. Mr. Xi challenged the incoming president not to forsake trade with the rest of the world. ""Pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room,"" Mr. Xi said in Davos last year. ""While wind and rain may be kept outside, that dark room will also block light and air. No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war."" The forum has also become a way to be seen with the growing number of global celebrities; last year, it was attended by Matt Damon and Forest Whitaker, the actors, and the singer Shakira. Officials with the World Economic Forum, which takes place from January 23 to 26, said they did not know what dates to expect the president to attend. The White House did not say when Mr. Trump would travel there, or say whether he would make other stops on a broader overseas trips."
Op-Ed,2018-01-09,"In a competition to woo students, public universities are increasingly offering lavish amenities that have nothing to do with education.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/opinion/trustees-tuition-lazy-rivers.html,701," In a competition to woo students, public universities are increasingly offering lavish amenities that have nothing to do with education. The latest trend is lazy rivers, which have been installed at several big institutions, including the Universities of Alabama, Iowa and Missouri. Last year, Louisiana State University topped them all with a 536-foot-long ""leisure"" river in the shape of the letters ""LSU,"" part of an $85 million renovation and expansion of its gym. It was L.S.U. students who footed the bill. At a time when college has never been more expensive, this is the last thing students should be paying for. According to the College Board, tuition and fees at public four-year institutions grew more than 60 percent over the past 10 years. State budgets for higher education have been slashed, and students have to make up the difference. In the case of L.S.U., the lazy river was financed entirely by student fees, an addendum to their annual tuition. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, over the past five years, those fees increased by 60 percent, nearly triple the amount L.S.U. students paid in 2000. Tuition and fee hikes at public universities don't come out of nowhere. Each has to be approved by a school's governing board, whose trustees are typically appointed by the governor. Ensuring affordable, quality education is an essential part of trustees' responsibility, but unfortunately often not part of their practice. Trustees of public universities are stewards of a public trust that rests nobly on the notion that an enlightened citizenry is vital to a democratic society. They have a fiduciary duty to represent the citizens and taxpayers who support public institutions of higher education, as well as the students who attend them. But even though the best interests of students and taxpayers revolve around college access, affordability and graduation outcomes, too often presidents and boards are more focused on the rankings, reputation and popularity of the institution itself. In my career as the president of two state universities and a consultant to nearly 50 higher-education institutions, I've observed dozens of college presidents skillfully co-opt their governing boards into approving costly projects that make schools look more attractive. (Of course, every college president has to increase costs sometimes. But the goal is to make sure it is necessary, while keeping expenses as low as possible for students.) Trustees, who typically meet four to eight times each year, are entertained as if they are visiting heads of state, flattered for their service and financial contributions to the institution. College presidents sweeten requests for new buildings and research centers, as well as additional student affairs programming, with cleverly branded words like ""promise"" and ""excellence."" What board would want to withhold promise and excellence from its beloved student body? College presidents also tranquilize trustees into agreement with impossibly large volumes of reading material. Trustees get binders full of documentation about institutional successes that are padded with expensive plans for increasing growth and reputation. Most come away impressed by their president's expertise and vision and assured that — thanks to their efforts — the university is on the right track. The unfortunate truth is that while most college presidents care deeply about their institution's success, an important part of their job is to shake free more resources. They seldom initiate serious campaigns to contain costs. This means it falls on trustees to be better prepared to help challenge costly proposals that don't add educational value. When it comes to state schools, the states themselves should educate trustees to understand their responsibilities to the citizenry and students. Training on big-picture issues and higher-education trends, such as the financial trade-off between instruction and research, the costs of intercollegiate athletics, and the expansion of amenities, would help trustees develop courage to ask college presidents probing questions that look beyond institutional narratives and cherry-picked rhetoric. Our nation's governors must also play a role. As they appoint public university trustees, they can and should mandate training to make university boards responsible to taxpayers and students. I don't mean to imply that trustees should devote themselves to ritual opposition to presidents, who usually possess an unmatched understanding of the institutions they lead. But presidents are not infallible."
News,2018-01-09,"ALBANY — Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn announced an 11-count indictment against a Brooklyn assemblywoman on Tuesday, alleging a raft of fraud, witness tampering and other charges, just the latest allegation of corruption and bad behavior among legislators in Albany.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/nyregion/corruption-albany-pamela-harris.html,705," ALBANY — Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn announced an 11-count indictment against a Brooklyn assemblywoman on Tuesday, alleging a raft of fraud, witness tampering and other charges, just the latest allegation of corruption and bad behavior among legislators in Albany. The Assembly member, Pamela Harris, a Democrat who represents Bay Ridge, Coney Island and several other south Brooklyn neighborhoods, was accused of four counts of making false statements, two counts of wire fraud, two counts of bankruptcy fraud, and a single count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, witness tampering and conspiracy to obstruct justice, according to Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Ms. Harris, 57, a retired New York City correction officer who was elected in a special election in 2015, was arraigned on Tuesday afternoon before a United States magistrate after prosecutors released a lengthy dissection of her alleged crimes. In one scheme, authorities accused Ms. Harris of trying to capitalize on a natural disaster, improperly receiving nearly $25,000 in federal funds by falsely claiming that she had been displaced from her Coney Island home by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In another, she is accused of siphoning money from a nonprofit she ran to pay her mortgage, take vacations and shop at Victoria's Secret, according to the indictment. Ms. Harris pleaded not guilty to all 11 charges. Her lawyers, Joel Cohen and Jerry H. Goldfeder, called Ms. Harris an ""invaluable community organizer and a well-regarded legislator."" ""We are disappointed that Ms. Harris was indicted,"" the lawyers said, noting that none of the charges were related to her conduct as a lawmaker. Indeed, many of the allegations brought against Ms. Harris predate her time in public office, when she served as the executive director of a nonprofit organization, Coney Island Generation Gap, in Brooklyn. The indictment cites a series of schemes to defraud government agencies including the New York City Council, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. She is also accused of making false statements to a federal bankruptcy court in connection with a Chapter 13 filing she made in 2013. The charges suggest a striking degree of planning and elaborate attempts to cover up illegal actions. Prosecutors said, for example, that Ms. Harris used a forged lease to draw down discretionary funds from the City Council, money that was supposed to be used to rent a studio space for the nonprofit, which seeks to involve children and young adults in the arts. Instead, Ms. Harris diverted the money to her personal checking account. All told, some $35,000 was received in two separate instances using such funds, prosecutors said. In the Hurricane Sandy scheme, Ms. Harris is accused of creating fake lease agreements and receipts, and forging a landlord's signature, to receive housing assistance money from FEMA for 14 months after the storm, a ploy that she also used to receive financial assistance to repair her Coney Island home in 2016. And once she became aware of a federal investigation last year, Ms. Harris told potential witnesses to lie to federal agents, the authorities said. At a brief arraignment, Magistrate Judge Ramon E. Reyes Jr. limited Ms. Harris's personal travel to New York City and Long Island, though she could be permitted to go upstate in her capacity as a legislator. ""I understand you might have to go to Albany to take care of some things,"" Judge Reyes said. Lawmakers in the Capitol seemed surprised by the news, which broke just as the Legislature was starting its business on Tuesday morning. ""They are very serious charges and it's important to let the justice system take its course,"" said Michael Whyland, a spokesman for Carl E. Heastie, the Bronx assemblyman who serves as the chamber's speaker. Charles Barron, a fellow assemblyman from Brooklyn, said the charges were shocking and sad, if still unproven, and bound to reflect badly on the State Assembly, whose former leader, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, was convicted of federal corruption charges in 2015. (Mr. Silver's conviction was vacated last year, but he is expected to be retried in 2018.) ""Once you violate the trust of the people,"" Mr. Barron said, ""that makes it very, very difficult."""
